        <section>
            <p>In <strong>computer science</strong>, an <strong>Implementation</strong> is a realization of
a technical specification or algorithm as a program, software component,
or other computer system through computer
programming anddeployment.<a href="\%22http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation#Computer_science\%22">Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>The main aspect of the aggregator is its content curation. Which
essentially means we have to sort all the feeds into topics/categories
based on what they are about. We have two fields of interest in an RSS
Field – one is <strong>title</strong> and the other is <strong>description. </strong>Using these,
it is possible to analyze the feed and take a good guess what it is
about.</p>
<p>Another approach we can take is to analyze the consecutive words in a
feed title, and compare them with other feed titles. Common words such
as verbs, adjectives etc. will need to be filtered out. An example of
this could be the recent <strong>Google I/O</strong> where many feed titles contained
the word thereby allowing the algorithm to correctly categorize them.
This would be the work of a tokenizer and an iterative loop comparing
the result with every other title.</p>
<p>Another way would to be create a <em>Set </em>of recognized categories as we go
along, and search the title for these words. If the title contains words
occurring in existing categories, the the feed is categorized under it.
If not, then the feed words are used to identify a new category. The
rank of a category can be formed as we move through the feed. After the
feeds have been categorized, a single loop to re-evaluate the category
is necessary to weed out any errors in categorizing. If a feed has been
categorized as something else inspire of it containing words belonging
to a better ranked category, this will correct it.</p>
<p>A further scalable approach is to store the feeds in a database on the
server, and then to query the tables to identify the relationships. The
words extracted from the feeds would be stored in tables, and each row
would be joined with the corresponding rows containing those words. The
results of which would then be entered into a new category. Doing such
operations at the server scale allows providing these curated feeds to
all subscribing users. However, the preference and storage for each user
will still have to be on device. Only the performance intensive
operations will be performed at the server.</p>
