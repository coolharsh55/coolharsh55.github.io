            <li>review: 
                    The two big questions with a final book in a series is always whether it delivers in the conclusion and whether it takes too long to get there. In this case, Tchaikovsky has managed to succeed on both answers. The book was interesting to read, and while I couldn't wait to understand the big reveal at the end, it was also interesting to see all the political battles being waged to get there. Felt more realistic than the alternative - that somehow everyone is idealistic and co-operates to save the universe. There were places where things felt stretched too thin and where it felt that episodic scenes were being played when we knew they wouldn't matter in the long run. But I still enjoyed reading through most of the book - and that's quite something. Thoroughly enjoyed the series.,
