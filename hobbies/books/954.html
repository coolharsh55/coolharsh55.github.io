            <li>review: 
                    This was not a book I found myself being absorbed into despite the breadth of content and the topic. This is because the eras are structured most recent first and then the ancient ones at last - perhaps because we know so much more about the recent time rather than the oldest ones. But it meant that I had to read backwards on what came about rather than reading how evolution worked. In addition, the narration was filled to the brim with rapid facts - and at some point I started suspecting how it can be that so much details are available across so many ages. Which means that it was perhaps an extrapolated fiction - which is not a problem for a pop-science documentary but it is indeed a problem if you are looking for something more educational and authoritative. Still, this is a good book to understand the variances of flora and fauna and would make for a good 'coffee table' addition.,
