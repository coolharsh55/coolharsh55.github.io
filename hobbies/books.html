(read more)</summary> <span>This is a well-written book with characters that are multi-dimensional, a world and setting that is explored in depth, and a sci-fi narrative that has sociological ecological analogies. The only thing that felt out of place was the setting of social constructs based on aristrocatic fox hunting, though I understand how that setting made sense for the story. Enjoyable, though the novel is a bit long and takes its time to showcase the mysteries. I can imagine this as being an excellent TV series.</span></details>

On the one hand, I enjoyed most of the themes in the book, and it is an excellent display in to the creativity Nick Harkaway has, reminiscient of Gone Away World. But on the other hand - its too dense, too big, and sometimes it feels as if it needs an editorial hand to condense the text into a page with borders.

Too much was happening - which made sense when I later read that the book is a &#39;magnum opus&#39;. But my main issue with reading was not the violence (which was a lot, and didn&#39;t feel drawn out or out of place), but that there was no single thread of the story that the reader is following, and things just seemed to happen. Yes, there is a central character, but it always felt as if watching a documentary recorded by someone else. Maybe that&#39;s because I&#39;m not the target audience, I&#39;m not American, and I don&#39;t know the history behind the three groups the story is about. Still - reading it was a good experience to pass the time. The writing is okay - its too &#39;prosaic&#39;, the story is good - and all of the book shows the &#39;reality&#39; of how comparatively barbaric we were not so long ago even if we fantasise civilisation and honour in the westers evoked in cinema today. The Judge is as memorable a character as any, and I could see the book could easily have been named &#39;Dancing with the Devil&#39;.</span></details>

The story is a violent thriller - which I like, and which reminded me of some books I used to read when I was younger. The story is told in the style of show rather than tell, with some acute observations and comments that feel poignant to read. I chose this book because I like the film and it has some intense characters that stay in memory. While reading I could visually recall scenes. While this speaks volumes about the film directors and actors, it also shows that the book is also a good story and experience in itself. Its rare that I like a book I read after I have watched and liked the film based on it. I have some more books by the same author, which I look forward to read.</span></details>

(read more)</summary> <span>I liked that this was an experimental book, more about exposition and conversations that are internal and external - and how there sometimes is no difference between them from our perspectives. The story was not overtly complicated, but the way it was presented added to the interesting writing style. A good, enjoyable read. Though I would have liked to see more of the magical realism the book started with, and to have it continue as part of the character&#39;s lives. So instead of relying only on internal perspectives of what one is thinking in a situation, we also would have had things happening (still normal, just written in the style). The illustrative writing felt cool to read through within the plot.</span></details>

(read more)</summary> <span>I didn&#39;t know a new book from Salman Rushdie had been published until I came across while walking through the book store. Bought it on an impulse - how could I resist. Looking forward to the mesmerising delight that is Rushdie&#39;s linguistic forte, I was quite surprised to discover that this was an incredibly clever and well-woven tale of modernity spun into the fabric of ancient Indian history. So much to easily miss, not notice, and realise that this is a really well written story. I missed the poetic language that evoke a love for reading, but the story itself being set in parallels to India mythologies was intriguing in itself. Still a good read - but I want to go get another Rushdie book to satiate my appetite for the language from Midnight&#39;s Children and Shame - which I immensely enjoyed.</span></details>

Curious enough, I flipped through some pages to know what the fuss is all about. The impression was that this was something interesting, so I ended up reading the book to know more. I thinl I&#39;m not the target audience for this book. It postulates that there are some jobs that are bullshit or useless. While the argument does make sense, I think it lacks a rigid social analysis and methodological analysis. Because an important consideration is the people doing the job - which could be saving time, effort, and so on. So are the jobs bullshit or is the job culture bullshit? The book nevers gets into it.</span></details>

The culture, characters, background, and implications were different - which made for an interesting read. The story itself involves aliens, telekinesis, fungi, secret government departments, and more. So it felt like a mashup of X-files, Neuromancer, and Snow Crash. What was not good was the editing. The chapters went back and forth between timelines too much, and the story felt rushed and not well developed in the second half.</span></details>

(read more)</summary> <span>This is an exceptional book that not only informs, but also educates and shapes the mind and perspective across many discplines. There&#39;s the history of the gene, including its scientific place in understanding the world as well as humans. But there&#39;s also a very well written account of how it led to the cultural changes, most prominently the eugenics movement and the Nazi&#39;s weaponisation of the gene and genetics. It explains how the gene was discovered, how its role was identified, and how we&#39;ve come to where we are today. Along the way it also explains the philosophical and ethical concers, the advantages of technological leaps, and the implications of every misinterpretation and mistake on a fragile culture. In this it never wavers on the science - I learned a lot about biology and genetics. It reminded me of the time when I was 14 and had checked out a genetics book from the school library and how fascinating I had found all of it. It blew my mind. This book gave me the same feeling throughout my reading.</span></details>

Some books expand the mind, or as Dawkins correctly puts it - they expand the &#39;consciousness&#39; because it forever changes the perception and ability to think about things. This is one such book. It really hammers down on religion, even though a lot of it (most?) is Abrahamic ones, the arguments and the logical questions are utilities for any and all religions. This is a great book to consider why we must question everything, and why things don&#39;t make sense when we put them in a consistent logical framework. And this is what religion is explained as - and why and where and how it ruins our ability to progress. Really influential book, and which has permanently set me on a path to finalising my mind. The only bits I would have liked to be included was an exploration of religions which don&#39;t have a written book, but instead rely on the moral policing by society itself. This is what I saw and experienced growing up in India. Its still religion, but there is no single word of God to debate against. The book does give the tools that are universal in arguments, but it would have been nice to see them used for exploring such social structures as well.</span></details>

There were times when I felt overwhelmed from what was in the book and comparing it to how little I knew or was exposed to. That there were investigations and court cases to such an extent, and that they were all somehow &#39;managed&#39; was a revelation. I always believed that there was mischief, but reading the book I&#39;ve come to the realisation that the reality is much more sinister and there is evil which believes itself righteous. The book also helped understand a lot of the current political landscape in terms of the key people and their (political) governance models. By the end I was feeling hopeless, lost, sad, upset, angry, frustrated, and in chaos. But this is also progress - because I went from ignorance to awareness.</span></details>

The rest of it was interesting at the start - a generational spaceship that is going to colonise a star systel - but it went nowhere and was disappointing. The bits about overestimating space travel, and that the biomes we need cannot function properly in space was interesting, as was the need for social organisaiton. But it all went more into drama and social commentary - overused at times - especially disappointing with no &#39;ending&#39; that could be of interest. No doubt the author has a great grasp on the practicalities of space travel and how to wrench stories from them, but this is not my interest.</span></details>

Though parts of it felt not that interesting, the lingering thoughts after the book had been over were that of thoughtful hints of something wonderful. For starters, the book has crows/corvids in the follow up to spiders, ants, octopuses, fungii... That&#39;s amazing. And then there is something new and alien, which though not mind blowing, really does end up with a fun read. I hope there are more books in this series, and that they are filled more with details.</span></details>

But, the book did not go too deep into these things, instead presenting anecdotes and rehashed arguments from other books. It is much more rewarding to read specific investigations, such as into politics, sexism, and social behaviours - which also inform about such distortions, but are more rewarding because they look at through the lens of causality.</span></details>

<br/>            <details><summary>This is an interesting bo... (read more)</summary> <span>This is an interesting book, with an apparent novel sci-fi situation containing virtual second lives. Why this is novel is beyond my understanding, when Philip K. Dick had already published the much more intriguing and existential Ubik way back in 1969, a good 30 years prior to this work. In addition, the language was off-putting. Phonetic English (writing as sounds are spoken, not as words conventionally written) may be interesting in small measures, but to read a lot of it is annoying. The choice of why medieval cultures are chosen to reanimate the dead is just absurd, and the insistence on classes, clans, wars, factions - is interesting were it not the overusage of convoluted sentences - seemingly for the sake of it. Definitely not a book for my tastes.</span></details>

Reading it today there is no indication of why this was a controversial or risky venture in its time and place. But the explanation provided at the end by the authors explains it quite well how imagining this in today&#39;s social situation where freedom of thought and speech are common is a difficult - we have no means of comparing or experiencing what it would mean to consider some thoughts as illegal. To imagine this has happened, and at the risk of happening again is a provocative realisation.</span></details>

A lot of online reviews, e.g. goodreads, point out the tone of the book being too opionated or that this information can be found elsewhere. I don&#39;t understand them. Can you blame the author when history and even large swathes of the current society are ignorant of women and their bodies? I&#39;m bitter about not knowing things that 50% of all humans have or are facing. And I don&#39;t even have a women&#39;s body. Despite this, I found the book to be educational, even if as a refresher to things, to know more about the crazy amount of issues women have to live with, every day every month, and that there are a lot of things that I should know about too.</span></details>

It is quite sobering, and astounding, if not merely depressing - to realise that this book was written 60 years ago (from today) and yet the words are eerily accurate and applicable to the current times. Whether to call people like Huxley and Orwell is an understatement. The fact that we did not course-correct is more telling that whether they were accurate. Because we could have decided not to let them be accurate. And yet here we are two generations later, seeminly worse than ever.</span></details>

The authors and consequently the book is very much rooted in Psychology and Anthropology as opposed to what I was hoping would be a more broader view of Biology and Philosophy. It spends too much time on anecdotal stories about babies and their abilities to communicate - which while very interesting, does not satisfy the question of how did we evolve to think symbols and languages. The title should have warned me - this book is only about primates, and nothing before that, but I suppose I was too excited to notice. For instance, communication is the basis for an idea - which the book makes clear, but utterly fails to consider any notion of communication in non-primates as being of relevance other than a few related mammalian instances. Birds, bees, insects, even plans all communicate. Do they have a language? Undoubtedly yes. Do they have symbols? Probably. Do they have Ideas? I don&#39;t know! By not considering this, the book fails at the premise of answering its own question. And identifying a larger one at that - whether the notion of ideas and symbols has been evolutionary only within us or we merely at the tail of a long chain of developments in nature.</span></details>

It definitely has valuable concepts and interesting perspectives. But reading it is just so painful that I wanted to give up in the first chapter itself. Things are excessively repetitive, often vague enough to make me browse back 10-15 pages to see if I had missed something explaining it, narratives jump across domains and seemingly unrelated topics that distracts immesely from what was being discussed, and to top it all - how designed jeans can make butts look bigger is used as an example of how our perception is not the &#39;objective reality&#39;.

<br/>            <details><summary>I received this book as a... (read more)</summary> <span>I received this book as a birthday gift from a dear friend. Incidentally, I had recently read &#34;A Brief History of Mathematical Thought&#34;, so I was more surprised and amused at having received this. Math books are not something my friends would think I&#39;d be interested in, quite the oppposite. I failed math in college. Good, clean, practical engineering maths. Because I absolutely hated the way it was taught. I always thought math is more philosophical, it is supposed to represent the way we think, or change the way we look and understand things. Instead, I was always taught math as a series of take-it-or-leave-it lectures that made me memorise formulae and their application. 

    When I accepted this book, I was sceptical - how much math stuff would I *not* know. I&#39;ve finished high-school, I&#39;ve finished an engineering college (where despite my failed math exams, I always did know how to do math), and a PhD in computer science. Turns out the answer was - there&#39;s always more I don&#39;t know, including the exactness of mathematical concepts, or why they are the way they are, or how they associate to the way I&#39;m supposed to be thinking. It reminded me something about another book - &#34;Thinking in Systems: A Primer&#34;, which also was about fundamentals and building a thought process that was close to what we&#39;re used to in terms of language and comprehension.

    A good read, a good topic, and a good gift!</span></details>

<br/>            <details><summary>A lot of stuff presented ... (read more)</summary> <span>A lot of stuff presented in the book may seem like common-sense and common-advice so prevalent in academia, but the impact and coherent view really puts everything in perspective together. There are lists, checklists, and areas where you are asked to stop and think before moving ahead. This book presents a great exercise in shaping the postdoc career from the start and is a good reference to keep coming back to in the first two years. Receiving this at the end of my PhD was a delightful (and useful) gift. That said, I would go ahead and recommend this to PhDs who are curious about careers in academia and want to move on the becoming a postdoc.</span></details>

To think this is the same author as the Three Body Problem is a travesty. The entire book is underpinned by subtle political commentary, which leaves a bad taste.

<br/>            <details><summary>I read this book on the r... (read more)</summary> <span>I read this book on the recommendation of a friend. We are both computer scientists, with her being vastly more knowledgeable than I am on the topic of machine learning. In fact, I barely know machine learning at all. With that as the background, reading this book is a good introduction to what’s been happening out in the world - provided you already had an idea about it. If you’re a beginner or someone who doesn’t already know about machine learning, I think the book is going to be unbearably dense and confusing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As for the contents of the book itself, I found the first half exceedingly enjoyable and fun to read. The little titbits of history, of explanations, and the connections were all an excellent addition to the reading. However, the second half of the book, in particular the last two or three chapters pertaining to the master algorithm itself were woefully inadequate, short, and dense for my continued comfort. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would still recommend reading this book for the topic and perspective, but with a fair warning about taking the last chapters on application of machine learning as ground truth. They’re not (hopefully). For instance, the author thinks privacy is overrated, laws that limit misuse of data are myopic, and that sooner or later we will all be handing our data to a ‘trusted third party’. I cannot agree with this in good faith. I must point out the good along with the bad - there was a good argument for transparency in the workings of algorithms, about introducing control points for tweaking, and being more cohesive in the different branches of technology and its applications (finance, health, medicine, even dating). These I agree and support, but lest we do not forget that accountability and ethics are also what makes humans as humans in addition to our superior intellect and reasoning capabilities. </span></details>

Tracing human civilisation starting from World War 1 through the various cycles of evolution, politics, religion, and even consciousness - this book is an incredible read. However, as things progress, there are greater and greater leaps of faith and fiction until we eventually reach the Last Men - the point where we read about things that happen without the time or space to think about why and its implications on us today. The writing is dry and typical of its publication era (1930), so a bit difficult to read and keep engaged with.</span></details>

Other than that, the book can be frustrating if one tries to figure out how to apply it everywhere. At this point, one realises that the book is an introductory course in systems thinking - it will tell what a system is, how to express the functioning of a system, and how to map some real-world events in terms of systems. This is like a first-year college course - you learn things, but you need to get more advanced knowledge before you can apply it masterfully. All that said - excellent book to get started.</span></details>

<br/>            <details><summary>This is an amazing book. ... (read more)</summary> <span>This is an amazing book. Absolutely great at forcing yourself to get out (or in?) and do some stuff - even if it is mundane scribbling on a paper (of the book). Felicia Day is like that hyper-cheerful host of a workshop that you turn up and sit silently at but then get asked in an extremely enthusiastic way to get excited and do some things. The start is annoying, a bit uncomfortable, and there is a dislike for the cheerful excited loud person in the room. But eventually once you start doing things it gets easier then nicer and then fun. The only right way to read (perform?) this book is to do some exercises, get on with life, then come back and do some more. The exercises (let&#39;s call them activities?) are stupid, fun, self-reflective, creative. And doing them makes the book personal - this is your creative diary now. The focal point of the book - which it hammers by showing you a mirror - is that you are responsible for the things that hold you back in your own head. I quite enjoyed going through the book - and plan to do the activities in ink someday again. </span></details>

Flights is composed of short stories of varying lengths - from single paragraphs to novella-esque lengths. Sometimes the stories have connections between them, sometimes they are split into parts. But the best part is that each story is a tiny island of personality into itself. I could never guess which storyteller I would get next. Each starting was a new adventure. The stories themselves are varied in topics, themes, and places - but they all share a vague resemblance and relation to the title &#34;Flights&#34;. The English translation was quite well done - but the beauty of this prose is undoubtedly in its descriptions and characters written by the author almost as if they exist. Maybe they do, and this was a travelogue all along - I don&#39;t want to know. I am sure I will be revisiting this book again some day and will enjoy it once again again too.</span></details>

There are lists, checklists, and areas where you are asked to stop and think before moving ahead. This book presents a great exercise in shaping the postdoc career from the start and is a good reference to keep coming back to in the first two years. Receiving this at the end of my PhD was a delightful (and useful) gift. That said, I would go ahead and recommend this to PhDs who are curious about careers in academia and want to move on the becoming a postdoc.</span></details>
