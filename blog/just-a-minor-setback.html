<h2 id="part-one-a-false-start">Part One: A False Start</h2>
<p>I ordered a custom built gaming PC, 
from <a href="https://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/">pcspealist.co.uk</a> based on
recommendations from friends who had bought from them before.
I expected it to be a source of joy (and
procrastination). But instead, what I got was the ridiculous incompetence
of shuffling back and forth trying to sort things out - a grim unsettling
disappointment instead of a cheerful demeanor.</p>
<h3 id="monday-225">Monday 22/5</h3>
<p>The day the PC was set to arrive, a Monday, 
I received a text from <a href="https://dpd.ie/">DPD</a>, the courier
company making the devilry, that my parcel would be delivered between
11:30 and 12:30. Exciting! I waited with great excitement at the thought
of receiving the PC early in the day, and playing <em>with</em> it. Except that
come 12:30, there was still no phone call and I was getting a little
irritated because the courier was late. What was ironic was that I had
received a parcel from DHL just hours earlier, and the entire thing
went professionally smooth. </p>
<p>DPD managed to screw up the delivery. On their website it now said that they
had tried to delivery the parcel, but no one had answered at home. What
maniac had been the driver, I wondered! I knew what had happened, the guy
had rung on the doorbell (which is awfully silent, because we live in Temple
Bar) and had not even waited to ring back or call on my phone, 
instead assuming that I was not at home. 
I called the DPD customer care, got the number for the
local depot, and calling them got me the number for the driver that had so
elegantly failed to deliver. He said he rang and waited for 10 minutes.
Bollocks. Then he said that he'd be back by 3 hours, after finishing all his
other deliveries, and then drop off the PC in the evening. Great! So I sat
there all day waiting for the delivery man to come and deliver, but as is life,
that did not happen. I was fuming furious. The customer service lines were
closed for the day and I cursed their professionalism in all the wrong things.</p>
<h3 id="tuesday-235">Tuesday 23/5</h3>
<p>The next day, Tuesday, I again called the local depot, 
got the number for the driver out
for delivery (who, thankfully, was a different driver) and called him. He seemed
nice enough, and confirmed and assured that he would indeed call me when he's 
around. He did, and when I went down to collect the parcel, he apologetically
explained that yesterday's driver had taken on more parcels than he could handle
and hence the delay and confusion. Whatever, I got what I wanted, and that was
OK for the day. I hurried up the stairs, and placed the box carefully on the ground.
What followed was the excitement of unpacking.</p>
<p>Okay, so everything was shiny new, and the thing had to be started. I plugged
the cord in, turned on the switch, and waited, but nothing happened. I figured
that in my excitement, I must have made a silly mistake, and so checked everything
again. Seemed fine. Tried connecting different cables to the monitor. Still wouldn't
work. I mean it powered on, but there was no display. Checked I was using the correct
port. Still nothing. Removed the RAM and tried again. Nothing. Not even POST beeps
that indicate the motherboard is working. Damn. Tried everything I could think of.
Took out both RAMS, put them in different slots, removed the Graphics Card. 
And yet, nothing would work. Finally I called the customer service line for
PC Specialist, and they couldn't figure it out either. They scheduled a RMA,
which meant I had to return the machine back to them. They contracted DPD again to
do the collection, and another misery filled experience followed.</p>
<h3 id="wednesday-245">Wednesday 24/5</h3>
<p>The collection was scheduled for the following day. Come Wednesday, the driver
dutifully failed to show up. I called up the local depot and they said they had
no record of any collections to be made that day. I called up PC Specialist,
and they said that they had everything okay at their end, and the system showed
a collection due. I asked for a tracking number so that I could co-ordinate with
DPD, and the guy at the other end promised that he'd email me. 
He didn't, of course. </p>
<h3 id="thursday-255">Thursday 25/5</h3>
<p>The next day, Thursday, I again called DPD, and gave them a stern word about
the days they were wasting at my end. They apologised and opened another collection
request, which, funny enough, was scheduled for the next day. I made them give
me a tracking number, called DPD Ireland, got their end of the tracking number,
and sat there waiting for Friday.</p>
<h3 id="friday-265">Friday 26/5</h3>
<p>On Friday, I called up the depot, got the driver's number (the nice guy was doing
the deliveries that day), and he called me right on time. Excellent. I handed
off the PC to go back to repairs or what not, and that was that. Since it was
Friday, it meant that the thing won't ship until the next week, and even then,
take about 2-3 days to get there. The repairs wouldn't start until the next day.
So I'm easily looking at 4-5 days just to get a notification of what's wrong
with the thing. And 8-10 days to get it back. Sucks. Big time.</p>
<h3 id="from-a-kid-throwing-a-tantrum-to-a-morose-adult">From a kid throwing a tantrum to a morose adult</h3>
<p>During all of this, I came quite a few times on the verge of losing control
of my temper and lashing out at the person on the other end of the phone.
Somehow, I managed to stay calm, and talk well, and politely. It felt strange
to rein myself like that. When the PC was first delayed, I was quite 
annoyed. When it refused to start, I was outright dismayed. It went from
irritation to sadness and despair. The familiar feeling of times getting
shitty as the clock ticked ahead. But it was easy to pull myself out
of it. The rationalising aspect was new, which was essentially me setting
out all the options I had like cards on a table, and choosing ones which
would give me the best possible hand. It was more of a logical choice,
that no matter what irritation I show, or feel sad, things would progress
according to rules governed by entities not under my control. DPD would 
deliver the parcel as they do, and PC Specialist would repair it as they
would. If and when either of them screwed up, I would react accordingly.
But for now, everything, all the plans and excitements I had built up
anticipating the arrival of this new toy, everything was simply put on
hold. And I had to carry on with my work, because that could not stop in
lieu of this. I said to myself, this is simply a minor setback, and just
like that, I went back to my life without feeling sorry for myself.</p>
<h3 id="the-in-between">The in-between</h3>
<p>PCSpecialist finally received my parcel on Wednesday, 31st May, last day
of the month. So it was finally in their hands without any cock-ups. 
They updated the status with information that they are looking into the
processor, motherboard, and graphics card. A few more emails about it,
and then it was the weekend, so there was not much in terms of expectations.</p>
<h2 id="part-two-the-second-coming">Part Two: The Second Coming</h2>
<h3 id="monday-0506">Monday 05/06</h3>
<p>PCSpecialist dispatched the PC today, and quite nicely, sent an email and
a text about it. I got a consignment number for DPD (which, no surprises,
is doing the delivery again) and a link to track it online. There was
nothing specified about what actually went wrong with the PC or if
they had replaced any of the parts. I would have expected a proper note
of diagnosis. As the delivery is from UK to Ireland, it takes about 2-3
days to get here. Which means I should have it by Wednesday or Thursday,
building expectations of weekend gaming.</p>
<h3 id="wednesday-0706">Wednesday 07/06</h3>
<p>I received a message / notification that my PC was out for delivery and I tried
out if it was the good driver (Luke) or the bad one (Gary/Greg). Fortunately,
it turned out to be Luke, so I <em>knew</em> that I was going to receive my PC today.
Come 11:30am, I received a call from Luke, asking me to come downstairs
and collect my PC. I went down, signed for the delivery, and got it back
upstairs. Half my heart was sure that the PC was fine and in working order,
but the other half was being cautious lest things do not work out like it
happened last time.</p>
<p>I got the PC back upstairs, unpacked the boxing, connected the cables, and
turned it on. First thing I noticed was the cool LED glow on the graphics
card fans. It looked pretty cool. Then came the satisfying sound of a POST
beep and I knew good times were here. The PC booted into Windows 10,
with a custom logo set by PCSpecialist and I was logged into a demo copy
of Windows. Awesome.</p>
<h2 id="part-three-the-good-times">Part Three: The Good Times</h2>
<h3 id="steam">Steam</h3>
<p>The first thing I did was install Steam. I did not wait around to reinstall
a fresh copy of Windows, or play around with existing settings, or even
the BIOS. Nope. I installed Steam. Oh, and along the way, updated the
drivers for the graphics card. The PC could connect to the wifi just fine,
though the speed was not great. I downloaded Doom as the game I wanted
to play. It took somewhere near 4 hours to install that, as the size was
quite massive at nearly 70GB. I took a nap.</p>
<h3 id="doom">Doom</h3>
<p>The thing with Doom is that it was the first game that made my jaws drop
as a kid. I must have been something like 11-12 years old when I first
encountered the unforgettable gameplay and level design. I was hooked.
I played all of it, and then played it again over and over. It was fun. Even
today, I still play the original, sometimes it's mod - Brutal Doom, because
it is such a good game. Knowing this, playing the new game was a thing
I was concerned about - would it ruin the memories, would it live up to
the expectation, and most importantly - would I have fun?</p>
<p>To sum it up - yes, the game is AWESOME. I have not had so much fun
shooting things in a long <em>long</em> time, and Doom is one of those things
that just gets it right. From the graphics, which were a breeze to watch,
and the new gameplay where monsters drop health, and all sorts of things,
it was <em>fun to play</em>. </p>
<h3 id="more-games">More Games</h3>
<p>Now that I've played one game I've wanted to play for a long long time, I'm
open to other things. Friend(s) recommended Killing Floor 2 and The
Forest as co-op with them, and I'm looking forward to that. Oh, and among
all these things, I have to try and remember that I'm doing a PhD.</p>
