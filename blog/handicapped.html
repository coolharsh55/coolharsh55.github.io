<p>A few days back, almost a week perhaps, I noticed slight fatigue in my body. I ignored it as being signs and symptoms of a hectic lifestyle, overtime work and inadequate sleep. It followed, and increased with each passing day. Soon I had headaches that started as a light tap on the back of my head. This turned into a full-blown jackhammer that wouldn&rsquo;t leave me alone. Needless to say, I was clueless, worried and irritated at being &lsquo;distracted&rsquo; from work. I carried on, hoping that it would go away. But it didn&rsquo;t. Soon I had a take the weekend off, and rest. Hoping that it was not some infection that I was fighting and that it would go away soon enough. I stopped using my laptop, didn&rsquo;t watch much TV, and slept insane hours of the day. It eased the pain a little. I had to conserve my energies for the football finale, which Germany won. A slight consolation. On Monday I took an appointment with the optician for the following day. When I went there the next day, a series of tests followed. At first I thought that I had acquired the need for spectacles, owing to the symptoms and signs. But it was not so. &ldquo;Your eyes are perfectly fine&rdquo;, the optician had claimed. No power, no corrections needed. Which means I did not need to wear glasses. But then, I did have an abnormally high amount of strain on the eyes. So I was advised, strictly I might add, to limit my exposure to devices to 6-7 hours per day. Which means I could not use a laptop, desktop, watch TV, use a mobile phone or read a kindle for more than 6 hours combined.</p>

<p>For me, it seems barbarian. I am used to being in front of a screen for at least half the day. Yes, that&rsquo;s 12 hours. Which is probably why I reached the current situation (this, and my careless lifestyle). So now, I must choose and prioritize my time. Research and its associated tasks come first, have, and always will. Other endeavors, whether social or academic, must take a back seat for the time being. I must turn back to paper and pencil to sketch my ideas. And the most painful (or perhaps, helpful), I must proof-write algorithms and programs on paper before I type them on screen.</p>

<p>I feel handicapped. Yes, I choose to use the word &lsquo;handicap&rsquo; being fully aware of its exact meaning and implications. I also know and respect the use of this word for people with disabilities. I mean no disrespect towards them. But I do feel that way about my physical inability to do a lot many things, primarily on my macbook, which I am used to do. It is a painful experience. It hasn&rsquo;t even been a few hours since the time I was made aware of my new restrictive schedule, that I have been annoyed and irritated by being cautious about how I use my &lsquo;screen&rsquo; time. I&rsquo;m confident that in time, it will teach me patience and perseverance. But till then, I&rsquo;m afraid that I will suffer a large drop in productivity. It&rsquo;s depressing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But me being me, I will look to do a lot more fun things as well. Such as more photographing. More dreaming, more thought experiments. And physical work. It&rsquo;s not a waste of time. There are a great many life experiments to be done outside the virtual world. But I do hope that all this will not contribute towards taking my research down-hill. Because I&rsquo;m sure that there is a great use for what I do, what I dream of. And that, precisely is what is keeping me awake these nights.</p>
