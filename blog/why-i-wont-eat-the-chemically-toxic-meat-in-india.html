        <section>
            <p>Meat - be it chicken, goat (mutton), pork (pig), or beef - is popular in India as part of its flavour-some cuisine. Chicken is the meat most consumed, and the choice of most carnivores across the country. Having grown up here, the taste of dishes such as butter chicken or <em>tandoori chicken</em> is familiar enough to have become a permanent memory. And yet, in my current trip to this country, I have refused to eat meat - because it is being pumped full of anti-biotics which are chemically toxic to our bodies.</p>
<p>It becomes difficult to convince people (here) about why I do not want to eat chicken - even though I explain in simple enough words. People - friends and family - still continue to eat chicken and meat, and keep asking me why I won't join them. Or they keep cajoling me to have <em>some</em> as <em>a little won't do any harm</em>. Which is why I took to writing this, so I can put this argument on paper once and for all.</p>
<p>This is the age of fake news and propaganda - so here are some reputed sources whose news can be taken at its word. And it's not just these - all major news agencies have reported this in one manner or the other. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/food/antibiotic-use-in-poultry-sector-rampant-cse/articleshow/63108265.cms">"Antibiotic use in poultry sector rampant: CSE" - The Economic Times</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/01/indias-farmed-chickens-dosed-with-worlds-strongest-antibiotics-study-finds">India's farmed chickens dosed with world's strongest antibiotics, study finds - The Guardian</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a-game-of-chicken-how-indias-poultry-farms-are-spawning-global-superbugs/article22597845.ece"> A game of chicken: how Indiaâ€™s poultry farms are spawning global superbugs - The Hindu</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All dairy animals are given anti-biotics, this is a normal practice much like we are vaccinated to give us immunity to diseases. However, the strength and dosage of this medication has a large effect on the body. The news reports describe how this 'good' pratice of giving anti-biotics is being abused in the poultry and meat industries in India. The stronger the anti-biotics, the greater are the risks that some bug or germ might survive and grow to create a new disease that cannot be treated by that anti-biotic. In indian meat industries, the drug of choice is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colistin">'<em>colistin</em>'</a>, which is often called '<em>the last anti-biotic</em>' because it is one of the strongest anti-biotics currently available.</p>
<p>Usage of this anti-biotic therefore signals a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Such anti-biotics have been given and abused previously to the level that the strongest is now required, which might also signal that there are super-resistant germs in the meat</li>
<li>Rampant misuse of other drugs without care even though it is evident that the meat is meant for consumption</li>
<li>There is little to no government oversight or control on this practice - even though the UN and EU have both made calls to phase out such practices elsewhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>The side-effects of consuming colistin is harm to the kidneys and the nervous system of the body. Not to mention potential exposure to the super-bugs which may spread and cause more health issues. In light of these, I think it is prudent to not eat any meat, especially chicken, while I'm in India.</p>
