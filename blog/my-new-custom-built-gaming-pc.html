<h2 id="the-why">The Why</h2>
<p>Playing video games has been a nice outlet for creative
enjoyment that I indulge in ever so often. Due to my policy
of not playing or not using the work laptop(s) for playing games,
I decided to get a dedicated gaming PC instead. Something beefy
enough to play all those nice-looking games.
I had a little saved money from all the TA/demonstrating work I did
over the past few months. And with a firm belief that I must do 
<em>something</em> with it, I decided to get a custom machine.</p>
<p>Earlier ideas were around ordering all the parts myself and just 
taking a weekend to build them together. This brought up thoughts
about the likelihood that I may
not take important compatibilities around, not to mention the
customer service when something does eventually go wrong
is a memorable experience for all the wrong reasons. I put up a
post on Facebook about this, and friends (<em>thanks Gareth, Aaron, Tam!</em>)
responded about <a href="https://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/">PCSpecialist</a>,
a UK based company that built custom PCs according to spec, and 
offered warranty and after-service. Okay, but what about the price
difference? Turns out that it was about a hundred or two more. I thought
it was a good deal, considering I was going to get it shipped in one
piece with the comfort of knowing that things will work together
well, and if they don't, I have a number to call.
So off I went to configure the beast of my gaming glory.</p>
<h2 id="the-what">The What</h2>
<h3 id="processors">Processors</h3>
<p>Everyone knows Intel rules the processing kingdom with both hands
tied behind its back. No matter what AMD does, and sometimes it
does things that are <em>very</em> promising, eventually, things never work out.
So with the arrival of Ryzen CPUs, there was a huge furor of how things
were going to play out. The nice thing about Ryzen is that they are
<em>cheap</em>, like really cheap. Although Intel still might have the most
powerful chips, AMD has the cheapest performant ones. Therefore,
it made sense to go with the newer Ryzen CPUs.</p>
<p>Ryzen has tiers, just like Intel does with i3, i5, and i7. Quite (un)cleverly,
they are named Ryzen 3, 5, and 7. Ryzen 3 is good enough for entry level
computing, but will not result in performant gaming. Therefore, Ryzen 5
and Ryzen 7 are best suited for gaming. The price difference between the 
top-tier Ryzen 5 and bottom-tier Ryzen 7 is nearly 100$. For economical
reasons, going for a top-tier Ryzen 5 is better due to the comparative
performance specs. R5 (Ryzen 5) 1600 and 1600X are the two top-tier
with the difference between them being the base clock speed and 50$.
If one can afford it, the 1600X offers better performance, but the 1600
itself is good enough as well.</p>
<h3 id="graphics-cards">Graphics Cards</h3>
<p>Just like Intel up there, NVIDIA has been the de-facto awesome 
graphics card maker since ages. But they also have been the
de-facto assholes in <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2911459/why-nvidia-graphics-cards-are-the-worst-for-open-source-but-the-best-for-linux-gaming.html">many</a> cases.
As an open source advocate, and as someone who is quite
adamant on using linux over Windows, I think going with the
flow of the community is of essence. In terms of <em>pure</em> performance
metrics, sure, NVIDIA works better. But with the advent of Vulkan,
which AMD has much better support in Linux, things might get
changed. So the question I asked myself was, could I sacrifice a
<em>little</em> graphics quality as contribution towards the open source
efforts (AMD and their work with the kernel), and was this a step
that I felt was justified in spending <em>my money</em>. The answer is
a resounding yes.</p>
<p>AMD offers the Radeon series in Graphics card based on their new
architecture. These are RX200, RX300, 400, and 500 series with
increasing performances. The 500 series offers the best money
to performance ratio. The latest amongst those is the RX 580,
which is better than the comparable NVIDIA 1060.</p>
<h3 id="ram-and-vram">RAM and VRAM</h3>
<p>RAM is the memory you stick on the motherboard, which is accessed
by the CPU and which contains your data, programs, and operating
buffers. VRAM is the memory <em>inside</em> a graphics card, where data
related to the graphics is stored and only the card has access to it.</p>
<p>For RAM, the wisdom has been <em>more is better</em>. But at what point
does more become insignificant in terms of the gains it gives. Turns
out that it depends on what one does with it. For virtual machines,
more RAM means better simulation. For browsers, it does not
really matter because if you have a 100 tabs open, maybe you should
take a good <em>hard</em> look at your workflow. The sweet spot today
sits at around 16GB. It is enough to deal with most heavy tasks, and
is big enough to hold large amounts of data. 
The configuration them becomes 2x8GB.
With RAM, having two sticks of 8GB each instead of 16GB gives a 
better data transfer rate (10%-20%) as it allows the motherboard
to communicate with each RAM stick individually.</p>
<p>For graphics memory, <em>more is always better</em> because it allows
the graphics card to hold in more memory and assets while
processing. If stuff is in the VRAM, then it does not have to go fetch
it in the RAM or the slower disks. The current architectures offer
8GB graphics card, which is enough to make it future proof for a
few more years. Another thing to note is the kind of memory being
used here. DDR (double data read) allows twice the reads in a single
clock cycle, and there are advances in this technology numbered
serially. So DDR4 is better than DDR3 and so on. The latest is DDR4,
which means that the RAM and VRAM must be DDR4. The same thing
applies to RAM clock speed. Faster speed means faster memory
access. So anything 2133MHz and above should be fine.</p>
<h3 id="motherboard">Motherboard</h3>
<p>The thing that ties everything together, motherboards are simple
to reason about and easier to choose because of their dependence
on every other peripheral. The CPU socket type determines
what motherboard to choose, and the GPU and RAM types further
narrow it down. Thankfully, these days, everything fits in well 
together and there are no real mismatches. Well known companies
in this are are Gigabyte, MSi, and ASUS.</p>
<h3 id="ssd-and-hdd">SSD and HDD</h3>
<p>SSD is faster, smaller, and the future. Since it contains no spinning parts,
it has a better life and deals with shocks in an elegant manner. Ideally,
once would only have SSDs in their system, but owing to how expensive
they are, a mix of SSD + HDD is economical.
Because the SSD offers faster access to data, it should house the operating
system and any programs or applications within it. The data can be
stored on the HDD, and most data is read (buffered) into the RAM and
VRAM anyway. </p>
<p>For SSD, the size should be <em>at least</em> 128GB because that is how much
the operating system and applications eat up these days. Being one
step ahead is always nice, so 256GB sounds like a better deal. This can
be accompanied with a HDD of size 1TB or above. Since these come
cheap, even multiple disks of 1TB each can be configured for backups
and holding less important data.</p>
<h3 id="gaming-peripherals">Gaming Peripherals</h3>
<p>A gaming mouse or a gaming keyboard is nice because they offer 
faster responses and precision, which offer benefits in games,
especially ones that test reaction speeds. However, they are quite
expensive. The best ones have a laser precision system that offers
incredible accuracy for aiming. The best keyboards are mechanical,
which are great to type on, but are again, very expensive. A
compromise could be getting a good laser-based mouse, and a
comfortable keyboard to type on. Because I'd like to play from my
bed as well, might as well make them wireless. Both Microsoft
and Logitech make some good wireless combos.</p>
<h3 id="fancy-case">Fancy Case</h3>
<p>A gaming PC evokes images of a cool looking case with LEDs flashing
all about, a transparent side through which one can grok at the innards
as they turn up the heat through processing. In practice, the only
one looking at that case is me. The case sits beneath my table, out of
eyesight, so apart from the <em>cool</em> factor, the case doesn't really
help me out here, especially on a budget. A good case must be
able to circulate air, have good cable management, enough space 
for everything to fit together.</p>
<h2 id="final-specs">Final Specs</h2>
<p>Based on a thoughtful process which involved a lot of internet based
researching and witch hunts for weird bugs which might not get
reported, I finalised the specs based on what PCSpecialist had 
available with them and what I wanted in terms of gaming.</p>
