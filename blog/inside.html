        <section>
            <p>INSIDE is made by the game studio <a href="http://playdead.com/">Playdead</a> who also made the critically acclaimed <a href="http://playdead.com/games/limbo/">Limbo</a> - an iconic game by itself.
Inside is a worthy successor, surpassing its predecessor in many ways. Where Limbo provided a
sense of being stuck (in <em>limbo</em>), Inside topples that over its head to present
a narrative in a dystopian world with an unnamed boy making it's way <em>Inside</em> a huge factory
area of sorts.</p>
<p>We do not know why, or who he is, or what he wants. We just <em>control</em> him, which is an important
word to use. The game itself could have been titled <em>CONTROL</em> but that would then make it a spoiler. 
The game provides no narrative, no cut-scenes, no backstory. Throughout the game, there are hints,
though very subtle, about what <em>may</em> be happening. It is a masterpiece of storytelling.</p>
<p>The environment in the game is bleak, made up of foggy exteriors and machine filled hostile
interiors. The color palette is muted, giving it a dark and dystopian look. Patrols of armed
guards make sure anyone does not sneak in. Dogs attack any moving body. It all adds to the 
ambience of something sinister happening inside. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spoilers ahead</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The game starts at the edge of a forest, on the outskirts of the <em>facility</em> - an area guarded with patrols that
do not hesitate to use lethal methods to subdue you. The area is enclosed by a fence, and once inside,
the ambience changes considerably. There are not as many patrols. There are farm areas.
There are dead pigs with worms sticking out of them. Parasites.
Something feels direly <em>wrong</em> about the entire thing. As you make your way through,
you come across a factory of sorts. Chicks without a mother follow you around.
This is where the game reveals its sinister facets for the first time.</p>
<p>Once inside, a pig with a worm parasite sticking out of it attacks you. Removing the
parasite renders it docile and harmless. Almost <em>zombie</em>-like. One wonders what
the parasite was. Or was it acting alone. Who was controlling whom there. Progressing
only deepens these questions. You find a device that when put on, lets you control
<em>people</em> who return to the same zombie state as soon as take the device off. It is
intentionally <em>creepy</em>. This mechanics is used to solve several puzzles, and they are
quite clever in their design and philosophical in their intention. There are places
where you must not care about the people you control and intentionally make them jump
off high places, make them collide, <em>use</em> them to move ahead.</p>
<p>The gameplay really makes the whole aspect of <em>control</em> shine out. In a few places,
the person you control through the device must put on <em>another</em> device that controls
some other person. And the control is not merely symbolic, but also physically apparent.
While being control, the person reacts <em>directly</em> to your commands, as if you were
playing <em>as</em> them. It makes one wonder if the boy is itself under control.</p>
<p>The environment is drawn in 3D, but the path can only be followed in 2D, as if one
cannot walk away from a fixed path, cannot deviate. The soundtrack creates
an ambience of senselessness, of a bleak path that makes us move forward,
if only in curiosity, which is found aplenty along the way. There are other
mysteries, experiences of various experiments done on people. Some are tied
to devices, some caged, others moved along in a factory as if on an assembly line.
Machine act as sentries, taking out anyone who does not fit the pattern of being
<em>controlled</em>.</p>
<p>Sometime near the end, we are drowned and consumed by a water creature that
looks eerily like a girl. To our surprise, and horror, we find that we can now breathe
underwater. And control people without the device. It all hints to something
bigger and more sinister behind all the experiments. Once we reach the heart of the
facility, there  is a huge chamber, an experiment. Our path takes us there. And what
we find is quite <em>unspeakable</em>. A lump of flesh, humans, melded together into one,
hooked up to the facility. Likely acting as the power source for all the control. We
try to free it, but are absorbed by it instead. We now control the <em>lump</em>.</p>
<p>The animations and the way the lump moves, with its many hands and feet, is very
well done. Along the way, we are helped by some scientist, as they open doors,
clearly afraid of us. Others try to hinder progress, and try to trap us. Guards attempt
to contain us. Somehow, we manage to get outside, tumbling down the mountain
through trees that look like the ones the game started in. At the bottom, we lie in
sunshine. It is at this point that we <em>lose</em> control. </p>
<p>What exactly happened in the game is mysterious. Was the lump controlling us,
the player, in an attempt to help it escape. Was the boy just another zombie like
being, driven to free the lump. Was the entire game a meta-essay about control
that we, as players, exert. Was it a parable about the shackles we as a society
face in being controlled by everything we use everyday. The answer is not there
right in the face. But there is a secret ending, that unravels itself if you collect
various <em>orbs</em> strewn throughout the game. It may very well be the <em>real</em>
ending. It depicts the boy unplugging what appears to be a power socket on
the wall only to stop and slump like a mindless zombie. It symbolises that whatever
was controlling him can no longer do that, he is free now. From us, the player,
and possibly from the lump. It tells a lot.</p>
<p>Inside is a work of art, and as such, must be experienced by oneself. The answer
does not matter as in all works of art, as long as you <em>think</em> on it, on how it
made <em>you</em> feel. That is why, you, <strong>must</strong> play Inside.</p>
