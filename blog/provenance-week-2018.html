            <p><a href="http://provenanceweek2018.org/">Provenance Week</a> is a series of workshops centered around the theme of provenance. These are namely <a href="http://provenanceweek2018.org/ipaw/">IPAW (International Provenance and Annotation Workshop)</a>, <a href="http://provenanceweek2018.org/tapp/">TAPP (Usenix Workshop on the Theory and Practice of Provenance)</a>,  which are the two main workshops, as well as <a href="https://sociam.github.io/saap-workshop/">Workshop on Algorithm Accountability Using Provenance</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/incremental-recomp-workshop/home">Workshop on Incremental Re-Computation: Provenance and Beyond</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/uncc.edu/prov-sec-workshop/">2nd Workshop on Provenance-based Security</a>. I was there for a poster paper, presenting my work on extracting provenance from Privacy Policies. It is still work in progress, but the presentation of this was very fruitful in a provenance-dedicated event.</p>
<p>Being workshops, the scale of events was much smaller. The venue was Kings College in London, which is a very nice place. However, lunch was pretty much sandwiches everyday (just like in Ireland), which was a little off-putting for me. The event being provenance-focused, I was very much interested in the various things people were working on, and had many productive conversations.</p>
<p>In particular, there was a paper on a GDPR based provenance ontology which I was keen to check out. It just so happened that I met the author completely by accident well before the event had even started. I arrived nearly an hour earlier than I was supposed to, and so was busy working away on my laptop. Another attendee also turned up soon, and we got around to chatting about our work at the table. I mentioned it to him that I was particularly keen on <a href="http://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~belhajjame/Program_files/pdf/s4_p1.pdf">this GDPR paper</a> and was looking forward to talking to its author(s). Right at that moment, the guy sitting in the table in front of us turned back, and went, "<em>yeah, I'm that person...</em>", and we introduced ourselves and had some proper conversations throughout the event.</p>
<p>There were a lot of events arranged in the event, one for everyday. First day was a pub outing, which I didn't attend because I wanted to go around London. The second night was the conference reception, which was on the top floor of the building, and had a really amazing view of the Thames. It was also the night of the semi-final for the football world-cup, and there was one big TV in the room with everyone following the match. The food was quite good. Later outings involved a boat ride, and another pub outing, both of which I missed.</p>
<p>Overall, provenance week was a good event, especially given my research interests in the domain, and I also got to know other people and their work. Presenting the poster was a first for me (I had never presented a poster before), so this was a learning experience in just standing around and waiting (hoping) for people to come and pretend to be interested in my work. To be fair, there were a few, and I had good conversations regarding research and other work. Maybe collaboration if possible in the future. My impression was good regarding the event, and next year, I will be vying to present a full paper.</p>
