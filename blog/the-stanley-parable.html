<p>if you enjoyed this game, play another game by one of the developers -

<p>The stereotype of a video game is pretty well etched by society. A platformer to
collect coins, escape monsters, rescue princesses. Or race a car in increasingly
realistic visuals. Or maybe engage in violent or gory killing of other players
online in game series that iterate based on the same formula every year. You get the idea.
Then there are lesser known titles, something called <em>indie</em> which stands for independent
games. They are whacky, different, and usually not up to everyone's tastes. Rarely,
something comes out of this creative pit that shakes up everyone's minds and they
become legends in their own right. The Stanley Parable is one such game, and even
amongst the weird games, it manages to pull itself apart in the most clever of ways.
You know the line, it isn't something one can explain, it has to be <em>experienced</em>?
The Stanley Parable first that to a T.</p>
<p>Consider the premise of the game - you are Stanley, a model employee that finds one
day that everyone in your office has disappeared. You set out to find what happened,
listening all the while to a voice in your head - the narrator. While this could be a
clich√© starting to almost any game, what sets this one apart is the one thing that
makes up all experiences in <em>all other video games</em>  - the <strong>illusion of choice</strong>. Video
games follow a well-trodden path of taking you to places that have been carefully
planned and thought about. There is never ever a path that has not been thought about.
A player follows exactly what was planned - just like watching a film that has already
been shot. Most of the time, we enjoy this leading, unaware about it or choosing to
ignore it for the most part. In The Stanley Parable, we are confronted with this choice
and it makes it completely absurd. </p>
<p>The idea of a <em>meta</em> game isn't new. But there is something almost <em>philosophical </em>about 
this game that sets it apart. It starts with a simple choice - there are two doors,
and while the narrator says, "...and Stanley takes the door to the <em>left</em>", it is up
to the player to actually choose which door they want to go through. Every choice
has a consequence. And finding all of them is the <em>real</em> exercise. Replayability is
not just for achievements, each choice you make <em>actually</em> is a hidden essay in to the
psyche of the game itself. Some are dead ends, some pretend to be dead ends. The game
is so <em>meta</em> that sometimes you feel it has restarted itself <em>in-game</em> while it feels
like it is just another regular restart. Things change during such events - as if
your visiting the same choice twice, or choosing another door after the previous one
makes an interesting different. It is almost (and probably is) <em>psychological</em>.</p>
<p>If you are the sort of person who reads something or engages in conversations because
there's a different idea there, or watches films that promise a new viewpoint, or
just walk into an art gallery for the <em>experience</em> or think about stuff people never seem
to talk about, or are just imaginative in the sense of the word - you <em>should</em> play this game.
Even if you do not identify yourself with any of those, play it. Like a good mystery,
it deserves to be dissected and discussed with your friends. Use it like your own
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_test">Rorschach Test</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Spoilers ahead</strong></p>

<p>Like one of the endings in the game reveals - all paths have been <em>per-calculated</em>, which is
another way of saying that while there is an illusion of choice, none of it actually matters.
Playing the game feels like an <em>exercise</em> as the narrator tries to influence you in ways
that range from being helpful to sinister to outright creepy. There are scenarios thrown
at you that do not make sense in the game, or feel like it is <em>being clever</em>. But once you 
start peeling the little layers of the narration, it reveals quite a surprising depth.</p>
<p>There are countless interpretations of the game. Some make more sense while others seem
quite unlikely. My favorite one is where the narrator is most likely running tests on
a person - I do not even think that they are <em>actually</em> Stanley - and are testing the response
based on what choices we make. This is why I made the parallel with the Rorschach test; the
game feels like an elaborate virtual test at you - <em>the player</em>.</p>
<p>There are things like artwork representing the making of the game - belying the reality of the
game and exposing its construct. There are outrageous scenarios such as pretending Stanley
has a wife only to be goaded at by the narrator as he tells you that she never existed. There
are clues - such as when the game has been played enough times (<em>in-game</em>) - the narrator
does not even bother to repeat things such as keypad codes, 
musing instead that <em>"you know this by now".</em> There are end of the world scenarios, there are
creepy <em>your boss is stalking everyone</em> scenarios. There are various <em>endings</em> that go from
paranoia to psychedelic. There is a place where Stanley goes mad and the game <em>restarts</em>. It
all makes the discovery a journey of evoking emotions that feel <em>artificial - </em>just like in
a clinical trial. </p>
<p>The game has a lot of depth; but it is not of the kind where one can get to all endings
in a weekend. There is no <em>appreciation</em> of completing it that way. Instead, I want to come
to each ending in due time, having contemplated everything as I move along the paths
in a slow but thoughtful way. I plan to discuss each ending here as I progress.</p>
