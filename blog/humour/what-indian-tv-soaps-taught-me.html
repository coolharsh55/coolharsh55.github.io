        <blockquote>
<p>I detest TV soaps and hate the way they give rise to such perspectives</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
    <li>Women are highly exploited and their development is merely a fa&ccedil;ade to steer away from the real issues</li>
    <li>
    Women can be the best heroes and the best villains, Men are merely supporting puppets
    </li>
    <li>
    No matter what life you live, bad times come 100 times more than good times.
    </li>
    <li>
    Indians are highly prone to memory loss. A slight accident or shock may cause massive brain failure resulting in loss of memory. Or maybe the men are simply tired of shrieking women (???).
    </li>
    <li>
    In spite of all the riches and the sound education, no one has any sense to talk things out
    </li>
    <li>
    Indians are basically lacking any concrete interest in life. Hence every moment, every situation comes with it&rsquo;s own hyper-alerting background sound. Never think anything is ordinary!
    </li>
    <li>
    Some people have divine blessings (read Boss&rsquo;s) and can live much longer than normal beings
    </li>
    <li>
    Some also having divine blessings (same as above) can be resurrected in-numerous times
    </li>
    <li>
    No matter what the conditions are in other fields of technology, Indians have perfected plastic surgery to the point that changing faces alters height, voice, expressions, other features and even style!
    </li>
    <li>
    We (read rich Indians) like to play dress-up everyday (the theme is mostly extravagant weddings)
    </li>
    <li>
    Daily soaps are also contributing to the economy, as we have become the largest producers(or importers???) of glycerin.
    </li>
    <li>
    Any action needs to be repeated a minimum of three times for complete effectiveness
    </li>
    <li>
    After every action, or situation, it is vital and important to note (or record???) every members facial expressions. Point 12 applied here.
    </li>
    <li>
    Time leaps are a good way to escape things that are too boring or repetitive (read normal)
    </li>
    <li>
    No matter what daily soap you see, it &lsquo;supposedly&rsquo; has no psychological effect on you. Children are perfectly allowed to see it. If you do not have any troubles or incidents in your life, you suck!
    </li>
