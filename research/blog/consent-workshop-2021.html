        <p>Along with <a href="http://www.vitorjesus.com/">Vitor Jesus</a> and <a href="https://rel-incode.github.io/cristianasantos/">Cristiana Santos</a>, I was an organiser for a workshop on <a href="https://consentworkshop.com/2021">COnSeNT</a> (Consent management in Online Services, Networks and Things). The workshop was conducted on 7 September as part of a larger academic conference, the <a href="https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/EuroSP2021/">IEEE European Conference on Security and Privacy (Euro S&amp;P)</a>. It was a one-day event, conducted virtually over Zoom owing to the disruptions of COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The workshop was focused specifically on "consent", as it is applied to applications, services, industries, and many more through the medium of internet. It consisted of six papers, which spanned a diverse set of researchers as well as research domains. The event also consisted of a keynote and a panel where experts disseminated and discussed the state of the art and the current issues surrounding consent and consenting practices.</p>

<p>Information about the event, including its programme, links to presented papers and proceedings, recorded keynote and panel discussions, are available on its website: <a href="https://privacy-as-expected.org/consent2021/">https://privacy-as-expected.org/consent2021/</a>.</p>

<h2>Keynote</h2>
<p>The keynote was given by <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/staff/dr-johnny-ryan/">Dr Johnny Ryan</a> (FRHistS), and was titled <i>"Consent ‘spam’ and the undermining of European data protection law</i>. Dr. Ryan is currently a Senior Fellow at the <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/">Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL)</a>. He was previously the Chief Policy & Industry Relations Officer at <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> - the radical web browser. His work has focused on exposing the depths and prevalence of the internet-based surveillance ad-industry and its implications for competition/anti-trust and privacy.</p>
<p>With such a rich and impactful profile, having Dr. Ryan deliver a keynote to the workshop attendees was one of the highlights of the event. The keynote provided a well-presented explanation of how the RTB-based ad mechanisms work, who the actors are, and how the data being collected and used contains several problematic categories and has cause of concern regarding impact. They keynote is available for <a href="https://youtu.be/WsA9Bwd0W1w">viewing online on YouTube</a>.</p>

<h2>Panel Discussion</h2>

<h2>Experience as Organiser</h2>
<p>Overall it was a positive and learning experience in organising an event from the proposal stage, to setting up a website, inviting reviewers, and speakers for keynote and panel. It was also an experience in management on the day of the event, the several tasks that need to be taken care of behind the scenes to ensure everything runs smoothly. Given the virtual setting, certain things were easy, such as managing people entering and leaving, but other things were noticeably difficult, such as keeping an eye on people wanting to ask questions or engagement in general.</p>

<p>One important thing that came out of this was realising how much time is spent organising an event, and how little is visible when attending an event. It also clarified how much time is spent in communications and follow-ups, and how despite the most well-written emails the details are forgotten and need to be reminded or kept at hand for quick dissemination.</p>

<p>Another aspect of academic events is peer-reviewing, which involves asking a person to dedicate their time and energy to review someone else's work. The reviewer gets no compensation for this, other than perhaps a rudimentary shred of prestige to put on their CVs. The authors also get nothing from this arrangement, since their work is essentially given away for free to the publishers. One of the reviewers asked about attending the event, or a sort of discount or other arrangement, but unfortunately we had to refuse this request to what extent we could. For the authors and to ensure the work could be disscussed to the best extent, we asked the authors for an open preprint copy of their articles as either a link or a document which we could post on the workshop website. Moving forward, open-access and reviewer-perspectives are two important aspects.</p>

<p>Inviting such a high-profile group of people for the keynote and panel turned out to be much simpler and easier than I expected. All I had to do was ask (nicely and politely). Most people responded quite quickly, and were sympathetic to the various hiccups in the processes towards attending. The best to invite someone is to have someone (who knows them) ask them to attend. Failing that, its perfectly okay to directly email someone with an invitation. However, always have a plan B in case someone doesn't reply, and for this reason always mention a date by which you expect a reply so that you can move on to the next option on the list.</p>
