        <h2>Testing 'benefits' of consent</h2>
        <p>#consent #GDPR #privacy #ads</p>
        <p>tldr; giving consent is assumed to provide some benefit, investigate what the benefit is in terms of extent and effectiveness</p>
        <p>When an individual provides their consent to the collection, use, and sharing of their personal data - one question is regarding what benefit or value they receive in return [3]. In the context of websites and consent, the purported benefit is commonly associated with the individual receiving improvements to their experience such as personalisation in the content or ads they see [1]. However, there is no tangible or demonstrable way to perceive the difference in such benefits when consent is given as compared to when it is refused. In addition to these, the process of giving consent is complicated and unclear to individuals [2] and uses purpose descriptions [4] which further obscures its transparency and impact.</p>
        <p>To investigate this situation further, this work requires the researcher(s) to visit websites and interact with consent dialogues to identify and record: (a) whether benefits exist in return for consenting; (b) whether they are clear and comprehensible; (c) can they be seen or demonstrated; and (d) what ‘value’ does it provide to the individual. For example, when a website says that the consent will enable personalisation in ads shown, does it also clarify where the ads will be shown, in what form and manner, and whether the individual can identify ads being influenced by their consent. Through such analysis, the work seeks to determine what 'value' is obtained in lieu of consent, its scope and form, and whether the impact of consent is transparent to the individual. The primary articles guiding this work are [4] for describing the purposes of consent and [2] for establishing the human-centric view in terms of understanding and comprehension when consenting. </p>

        <h2>A Privacy Signal for Automating Consent Interactions</h2>

        <p>#privacy #browser #signaling #internet #GDPR #BrowserAddon #Javascript</p>

        <p>tldr; Creating a browser signal that helps automate some of the interactions on notices and consent dialogues online</p>

        <p>Motivation: Consent and cookie dialogues are a plague on the web - they’re there on every website, and most people click on the ‘Agree’ button without reading or understanding what they just agreed to. Even though this has been shown to violate data protection and privacy laws [1], enforcement takes time and is difficult to undertake at the scale of the web. Instead, there is a growing call for easier-to-use and enforce ‘signals’ which indicate privacy preferences in a human-centric manner. Previously, Do Not Track (DNT) and Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) were two major efforts which failed to gain adoption. The current ones showing promise are Global Privacy Control (GPC) [2] - which can prohibit any further sharing of data, and the Advanced Data Protection Control (ADPC) [3] which can enable a machine-readable request and indicating of preferences to permit or prohibit certain actions. While uptake for both increases, there are two important areas of implementation and research - (1) what language to use within the signals so that both users and websites interpret it in the same manner; and (2) how to manage these within the browser.</p>

        <p>Implementation: You will understand DNT, P3P, GPC and ADPC specifications. They’re fairly technical which means you will also learn about how they work through HTTP communication protocols. You will then explore how ADPC can be implemented using HTTP. Within ADPC, a language is necessary for expressing whether something is permitted or prohibited and what it is (e.g. a purpose, some personal data). For expressing these concepts, you will use the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) [4], a metadata specification for declaring how data is used. To test the developed signal, you will create browser addons and a (sample) backend server for creating and managing the preferences set within ADPC, and testing the communication between users and websites.</p>

        <p>What you will learn: (i) What information is relevant when making privacy decisions about personal data use and sharing; (ii) HTTP protocols and how the web functions; (iii) How to express permissions or prohibitions for data sharing; (iv) Legal and Privacy implications of permitting or prohibiting websites from using data; (v) The next generation of privacy signals within the browser.</p>

        <p>Tldr; Create and analyse different methods and their impact for using and managing ADPC signals to indicate user’s privacy preferences using basic Web HTTP communication methods</p>
        <p>Motivation: Consent and cookie dialogues are a plague on the web - they’re there on every website, and most people click on the ‘Agree’ button without reading or understanding what they just agreed to. Even though this has been shown to violate data protection and privacy laws [1], enforcement takes time and is difficult to undertake at the scale of the web.

Within ADPC, a language is necessary for expressing whether something is permitted or prohibited and what it is (e.g. a purpose, some personal data).

The formal representation used for DPV is the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which you will become familiar with in order to read and write it for generating the dataset / corpus. To test the ADPC, you will create simple addons and backend server for creating and managing the preferences set within ADPC, and testing the communication between users and websites. You will explore different ADPC iterations in terms of how they affect the size (HTTP signals are expected to be small), their impact in terms of preferences (how much can we express), and what kinds of information can be sent this way (e.g. we can only share preference for personal data, but not who it is shared with).</p>

        <h2>Recording online consent via browser extension</h2>

        <p>
            #privacy #consent #javascript #GDPR
        </p>

        <p>
            Description: The "I Agree" button has become inescapable while browsing the web. While it is present as a legal requirement for collecting consent, once we have clicked the button, we have no record of what we just agreed to. In this project, you will be creating a digital receipt to record the given consent and the information associated with it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The goal is to create a browser extension that automatically captures the information in a consent dialogue box, and enables the user to later view it in a dashboard. It will use existing standards such as Consent Receipt [1] and Data Privacy Vocabulary [2] to record this information.
        </p>

        <p>
            This project will provide exposure on front-end development in real-world websites, and an opportunity for increased transparency online regarding privacy. It will also provide a learning experience for use of programming tools (e.g. git) and research based workflows.
        </p>

        <p>
            Pre-requisites: Good working knowledge of Javascript/CSS and its use in web-pages

        <h2>An Ad-blocker for Cookie and Consent Dialogues online</h2>
        <p>#consent #GDPR #Javascript #BrowserAddon #RDF</p>
        <p>Motivation: The GDPR’s extensive requirements for valid consent have filled the internet with consent dialogues that are a persistent annoyance to the web. The websites try to request consent because they are legally required to do so, and in the process use several deceptive and manipulative practices to force the individual to give consent. This project involves creating a browser extension similar to an ad-blocker that will block the consent-requests. The project will also study the effect of such blocking on the actions of the website. In principle, the websites are only supposed to collect and process data after consent. Therefore, the blocking of consent dialogues should result in no data collection.</p>
        <p>Implementation: The project will involve understanding the requirements of how consent is requested on the internet and the mechanisms of consent dialogues on websites. The project will create a browser extension - which requires knowledge of javascript and web development - to capture the problematic parts of a consent dialogue and tag it with common violations that are linked to specific requirements in GDPR.</p>

        <p>
            Consent dialogue boxes are everywhere on the web - with the information geared towards making it easy for users to comprehend how their personal data is being used. However, this information is presented in human-readable format with no way for machines to analyse it. The aim of this project is to extract this information and represent it as structured metadata to enable automation and analysis of privacy based approaches. For example, the statement "We use your address to deliver goods you buy on our website" can be represented by: address - personal data, deliver goods - purpose, use - processing.
        </p>

        <p>
            The project goal is to use NLP techniques to identify such categories by using classifiers and ML similar to existing work regarding privacy policies [1][2][3]. The extracted information would then be represented using vocabularies such as DPV [4].

            #privacy #ethics #consent #javascript
        </p>

        <p>
            The notion of informed consent in GDPR requires the individual to also be notified about potential risks associated with the processing of their personal data. However, consent dialogues contain only information associated with use of personal data and do not provide any information about the risks of sharing that information. The aim of this project is to attach risks with appropriate information within a consent dialogue to enable the user to make a balanced judgement about their consent and use of personal data. The project involves detecting categories of information within a consent dialogue and associating an existing corpus of privacy risks by visually annotating the consent dialogue.

        <h2>Privacy Policy Personalisation</h2>
        <p>#GDPR #privacy #Python #Javascript</p>

        <p>Privacy policies are written in a way that makes it difficult to understand which conditions apply to the current user and what exactly is happening with the data. For example, using terms such as "may apply" is confusing. This project will research into ways to personalise the privacy policy or notice to the user to generate text for what is precisely happening for the user. For example, "you used X service, for which we do Y things" and "you have not used X service, therefore the following Y things do not happen in your case".

        <p>Tldr; Scrape the app’s information from app store and automatically annotate it with information relevant for privacy</p>
        <p>Motivation: Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android are the dominant smartphone OSs, and through their respective App-Stores are responsible for providing the infrastructure and functionality to users for installing and managing applications on their devices. Increasingly, these companies are creating requirements for applications to declare information about their privacy practices, which not only include a privacy policy, but also information on what kinds of data the apps collect and how they use it [1]. Collecting this information in a machine-readable dataset can enable understanding current practices, pitfalls, and the privacy practices of apps - as well as tracking how they evolve with time.</p>
        <p>Implementation: You will utilise a web-scraping [2] tool to parse the information from app-store pages. This can be written in any language of choice, though python offers a large collection of ready-to-use frameworks. The information extracted from these pages will be defined using the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) [3], a metadata specification for declaring how data is used. The formal representation used for DPV is the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which you will become familiar with in order to read and write it for generating the dataset / corpus. The actual data will be stored and managed using a relational database and SQL, such that it can be extracted and exported to RDF to provide interoperability. </p>
        <p>What you will learn: (i) How Apps utilise personal data; (ii) How to do web-scraping; (iii) How to work with concepts and semantics, e.g. when creating schemas; (iv) Creating and managing datasets as research resources; (v) What/Where more information is needed in App Stores</p>

        <p>Tldr; Creating APIs for programmatically generating notices and dialogues, as those used for consent and cookies on websites, to be developed from metadata (e.g. JSON) to avoid known issues (e.g. dark patterns).</p>
        <p>Motivation: Consent and cookie dialogues are a plague on the web - they’re there on every website, and most people click on the ‘Agree’ button without reading or understanding what they just agreed to. Even though this has been shown to violate data protection and privacy laws [1], enforcement takes time and is difficult to undertake at the scale of the web. It is difficult to create a singular solution that is acceptable to all parties (users, service providers, authorities), which makes it difficult to achieve common goals. This research explores how a web browser can provide a set of APIs to generate privacy notices and dialogues on user-side, with different methods or options offering various levels of controls to the websites and users to control their interactions.</p>
        <p>Implementation: You will understand how current privacy notices and consent dialogues function in terms of information, content, legal requirements, and technical implementations. You will then identify different types of APIs that can automate the generation of different components (e.g. API for notice, for showing options, for giving consent). You will implement these using CSS and JS, and test them using browser addons.</p>
        <p>What you will learn: (i) What are privacy notices and consent dialogues (ii); How to create and implement APIs based on different stakeholder requirements (iii) Legal and Privacy implications of your developed technologies (iv) Challenges associated with developing privacy solutions</p>

        <h2>Automated Privacy Policy Generation Using Metadata and Templates</h2>
        <p>#privacy #semantics #law #python #RDF #GDPR</p>
        <p>Tldr; Create different variations of privacy policies in terms of text and design by using templates and metadata containing the required information</p>
        <p>Motivation: Privacy policies and Terms and Conditions, as they are presented on the web, are a long boring wall of legal text which is difficult to comprehend and use. There have been various avenues for making this simpler, such as summarising [1], or using machine learning to identify relevant information [2], and even alternatives such as visualising information [3]. However, instead of starting from a fixed given set of complicated text or a fixed layout, this research instead takes a different approach. It explores whether using metadata and a set of templates can make privacy policies easier to generate, offer different options to comprehend them, and enable alternative mediums such as visualisations to be easily implemented. It thus aims to show that metadata and automation can help people better understand privacy practices.</p>
        <p>Implementation: You will analyse how privacy policies look, read, and affect comprehension of information through existing literature on these topics. You will then create ‘templates’ for policies - where a template is (simplified) some generic document with blanks that will be filled with use-case specific information. The template will be defined using a ‘templating library’ such as Jinja2 or Moustache. You will create different templates for rendering the same information in different sentences, layouts, forms (e.g. visual, multimedia). The information to be used to fill in the template will be declared using Data Privacy Specification (DPV), a metadata specification for declaring how data is used. The formal representation used for DPV is the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which you will become familiar with in order to read and write it for generating the dataset / corpus. The actual data will be stored and managed using JSON or JSON-LD which makes it easier to use in the web browser and in javascript.</p>
        <p>What you will learn: (i) Issues with existing privacy policies; (ii) How to automate documentation using templates; (iii) What information is relevant for understanding privacy and legal compliance; (iv) How people comprehend information; (v) How to query and use linked data in a web application.</p>

        <h2>Extracting Structured Metadata From Privacy Policies</h2>

        <p>
            Privacy policies are notoriously difficult to read. One of the challenges is the use of legal and intentionally obfuscating language. Though the GDPR has made it a legal requirement to make use of clear languages in policies, there is yet a barrier towards effective transparency regarding the information presented in such policies. This project aims to extract information from the policy, such as - sources of data, their requirement in processes, legal basis, storage periods - and express it as structured metadata for use in research that aims to simplify privacy policies via techniques such as summarisation and visualisation.
        </p>

        <p>
            The project goal is to use NLP techniques to identify relevant information by using classifiers and ML [1][2][3], which would enable extraction of information from the text of privacy policies, and to represent it using vocabularies such as DPV [4] and GDPRov [5].

        <h2>Scoring Privacy Policies For Transparency and Readability</h2>

        <p>

        <p>
            Privacy policies are notoriously difficult to read and understand, chiefly because of the obfuscated legal language used and the confusing structure. Though the GDPR has strived to provide more transparency in the language used, there is no measurement of how to evaluate such policies. The aim of this project is to identify metrics for transparency and readability in the privacy policy and to score a given policy using them. An example metrics could be categorisation of information, where the policy has separate structures explaining data collection, sharing, etc. The project will use NLP to identify relevant clasues in the text of the policy, and ML to classify the policy using generated metrics.

        </p>

        <p>
            Privacy policies can be made easier to digest if they are provided as efficient summaries which the users can read and understand quickly. This project will attempt to assist in the understanding of a privacy policy by abstracting or folding larger sections into shorter summaries. This will done by analysing the text using NLP and identifying relevant information to provide a summary.

        <p>Who gives grace periods for enforcement - table of DPAs. DPC has one for 5 OCT 2020. Why grace periods so late after GDPR? e.g. 2016 published, 2018 enforcement, then grace periods after that. Do DPAs have authority to give grace periods? Rational of grace periods could be to clarify unknown ambiguity, for known or repeated implementation, grace periods legitimise illegal data processing. Legality of data processing conducted up to or before grace periods - have there been indication of cancel or stop that processing, e.g. to ask for consent again - has this been mentioned in the guidelines?</p>

        <h2>Browser extension for Documenting Legal Compliance Violations in Consent Dialogues</h2>
        <p>#consent #GDPR Javascript #BrowserAddon #privacy #RDF</p>
        <p>Motivation: The GDPR lays out specific requirements on how to request and collect consent - something most websites seem to get wrong. With limited human and technological resources, it is difficult for an investigation agency to manually inspect all the websites for compliance. Technologies can help solve this by automating the detection part, but need data to be effective in detection. Further, the technological findings need to be expressed using legal language and formal information in order for them to be used effectively in legal compliance. This project will assist in these tasks by creating a browser extension which will enable any individual to highlight problematic parts of a website and consent dialogue, and will automatically generate  documentation containing links to appropriate legal clauses i.e. which specific parts of GDPR it violates. </p>
        <p>Implementation: The project will involve understanding the requirements of consent under GDPR, and evaluating how they are being violated on the internet at large. The project will create a browser extension - which requires knowledge of javascript and web development - to capture the problematic parts of a consent dialogue and tag it with common violations that are linked to specific requirements in GDPR.</p>
        <p>This project intends to address these by identifying the different mechanisms used to collect consent, establish their relation to existing consent requirements, and compile likely violations of legal requirements. Initially, researcher(s) will visit websites, identify elements used for consent, record their use, and establish which consent requirements in GDPR are applicable to the design element. Later, the researcher(s) will analyse the collected data for commonality in design elements, and report on likely violations of the legal requirements. The primary articles guiding this work are [4] and [8].</p>

        <h2>Assisting with Ethical Clearance in Universities</h2>

        <p>
            #ethics #javascript
        </p>

        <p>
            Description: Modern organisations must take into account GDPR concerns when conducting data collection and in universities this role is taken by the Ethics committee and its sub-committees. This project will develop a new stand-alone web-based tool to help students completing Ethics/GDPR applications for their projects. It is planned to create a high usability web interface that simplifies the current form and known patterns of use, e.g. a simple survey, to guide students through the form generation process. The outcomes will be a transportable JSON object that expresses the student’s wishes in a machine-readable way for further stages in an approval workflow.
        </p>

        <p>
            The project involves work on building a web dashboard for assisting researchers with documentation for data protection and ethical clearance, and will provide an opportunity to participate in real-world applications of technology in the areas of data protection and ethics. The chief task would be to build an information system that will allow users to receive suggestions and guidance for addressing risks regarding ethics and privacy.

        <h2>Building a Registry of CCTV Notices and their Privacy Practices in Dublin</h2>
        <p>#privacy #surveillance #dashboard #GDPR #BrowserAddon #Javascript</p>
        <p>Tldr; Creating a browser signal that helps automate some of the interactions on notices and consent dialogues online.</p>
        <p>Motivation: GDPR requires CCTVs to be accompanied with notices explaining who is operating them, what kind of data is collected and retained, what it is used for, any possible use of techniques such as facial recognition, etc [1]. It is difficult to identify such notices for CCTV, and to keep track of them all together. It would be useful for the general public, authorities, and other CCTV users to understand the contents of these notices, and how they operate under GDPR.</p>
        <p>Implementation: You will learn how CCTV notices are used in real-life, what their information is, and the kinds of technologies involved (e.g. types of cameras). You will collect examples of real-life CCTV and their accompanying notices, store them in a database, and build a dashboard to provide convenient access to this information. The dashboard will enable users to see an overview of CCTV usage (data categories, purposes, controllers) and their locations (e.g. on a map). You will build a form or input provider for crowdsourcing this information. You will write your report based on this implementation and analysis of collected information (e.g. comment on data being collected, technologies involved, difficulty of obtaining this information).</p>
        <p>What you will learn: (i) How CCTVs work in real-life, and their requirements under GDPR regarding privacy, transparency, and notices (ii) Information gathering and data modeling (iii) Building a dashboard based on functional and non-functional requirements (iv) Analysis of technologies regarding privacy risks and GDPR</p>
