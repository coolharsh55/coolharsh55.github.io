    A machine-readable specification for the representation and documentation of information related to data breaches and their communications
    </small>
</div>
        <div id="content" property="schema:articleBody">
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Data breaches and other security incidents are an emerging challenge in the digital era. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires conducting an impact assessment to understand the effects of the breach, and to then notify authorities and affected individuals in certain cases.
Communication of this information typically takes place via conventional mediums such as emails and forms on the websites of authorities, and is a manual process.
To assist in developing tools to support data breach investigations, and to enable automated systems for assisting with breach assessments and GDPR compliance, we present a machine-readable specification for the representation and documentation of information related to data breaches and their communications. 
The specification uses current requirements from the GDPR obligations and authoritative guidelines.
To represent information, it extends the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) by introducing new concepts required for data breach relevant information.</p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong>GDPR, data breach, cybersecurity, semantics</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires data breach
notifications to be sent to authorities and data subjects based on an
assessment of the breach’s impact on rights and freedoms. Conducting
such assessments is difficult in practice due to lack of knowledge
regarding what risks exist and how to associate them with the factual
information available regarding a breach. Further, reporting the breach
also involves additional information not explicitly required by the GDPR
- for example the Irish Data Protection Commission’s data breach
reporting form provides a specific list for ‘nature of the breach’ which
includes events such as ‘processing error’ and ‘unauthorised access to
personal data’ via different mediums. Other authorities’ websites have
similar forms that provide a different set of information. With
increased cybersecurity reporting requirements through laws such as the
Network and Information Security Directive (NIS2, 2023) and Digital
Operational Resilience Act (DORA, 2023), the process of reporting
security incidents such as data breaches will require more information
and communications amongst a larger pool of parties. Relying on
conventional documentation and communication measures therefore
represents a barrier to effective compliance.</p>
<p>We present a specification to define information regarding data
breaches in a machine-readable form (by using semantic web standards
such as RDF) so as to address these challenge and enable the development
of interoperable tools for assisting organisations and authorities in
their data breach requirements. In this, we reuse and extend the Data
Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) <span class="citation"
data-cites="panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"><a
href="#ref-panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span> which enables machine-readable
representation of information related to GDPR, and has been used for
documenting Register of Processing Activities (ROPA) <span
class="citation" data-cites="ryanDPCatSpecificationInteroperable2022"><a
href="#ref-ryanDPCatSpecificationInteroperable2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span> and Data Protection Impact
Assessments (DPIA) <span class="citation"
data-cites="panditSemanticSpecificationData2022"><a
href="#ref-panditSemanticSpecificationData2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span>. Our contributions provide the
necessary concepts to represent information about data breaches,
documentation pertaining to reporting of data breaches, and
notifications communicated regarding data breaches. The resulting
specification<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> is being published by the W3C Data
Privacy Vocabularies and Community Group (DPVCG) to provide data breach
concepts and guidance as well as in the continued refinement of the risk
and impact assessments.</p>
<h2 id="background-and-state-of-the-art">Background and State of the
Art</h2>
<p>GDPR Article 4-12 defines a ‘personal data breach’ as "a breach of
security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data
transmitted, stored or otherwise processed." The European Data
Protection Board (EDPB), in its Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data
breach notification <span class="citation"
data-cites="Guidelines2022Personal"><a
href="#ref-Guidelines2022Personal" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span>
interpret this definition to formulate three categories where personal
data is unlawfully or accidentally breached. These categories are:
‘Confidentiality breach’ for disclosure or access; ‘Integrity breach’
for alteration; and ‘Availability breach’ for loss of access or
destruction. Thus, a data breach under GDPR spans a broader spectrum of
processing activities over personal data than the conventional use of
the term which is limited to unauthorised access. Further information on
the requirements for handling data breaches are found in GDPR’s Articles
33 (notifying authority), 34 (notifying data subject), 39 (DPOs), and 55
(authorities). To assist with these obligations, data protection
authorities such as the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) have
issued guidelines <span class="citation"
data-cites="PracticalGuidePersonal"><a
href="#ref-PracticalGuidePersonal" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></span>
and developed a form on their website for convenient reporting of data
breach.</p>
<p>The novelty of data breach obligations under the GDPR has attracted
interest from diverse stakeholders. Schlackl et al. <span
class="citation"
data-cites="schlacklAntecedentsConsequencesData2022a"><a
href="#ref-schlacklAntecedentsConsequencesData2022a"
role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span> have analysed the causes and
consequences of data breaches, and found that data breaches are caused
by and affect a wide variety of domains, including internal
organisational processes. Their analysis provides the necessary
background information on how to link a data breach assessment to
internal organisational processes, and how to represent the causes and
consequences related to a data breach. We utilise these as the knowledge
for enrichment of DPV’s risk assessment concepts, and for use within the
data breach reports and impact assessments. The DEFeND H2020 project
utilises machine-readable information in its “privacy by design platform
for GDPR compliance”, which includes modules associated with data breach
monitoring and notifications to data subjects <span class="citation"
data-cites="pirasDEFeNDArchitecturePrivacy2019"><a
href="#ref-pirasDEFeNDArchitecturePrivacy2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span>, but does not provide details
regarding the implementation of these features.</p>
<p>Efforts to consolidate knowledge regarding data breaches has led to
the creation of a “Global Data Breach Database” <span class="citation"
data-cites="netoDevelopingGlobalData2021"><a
href="#ref-netoDevelopingGlobalData2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></span> which lists the data breaches known
to have occurred based on publicly available information. However, the
database is rather limited in terms of available information, and its
information is also not available in a machine-readable form for
automated ingestion and analysis. Several initiatives exist that model
security information in a machine-readable form, such as VERIS<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, MISP<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>,
and MITRE - whose taxonomies such as Common Vulerabilities and Exposures
(CVE) <span class="citation" data-cites="CVECommonVulnerabilities"><a
href="#ref-CVECommonVulnerabilities" role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a></span>
are widely utilised to represent security related information. Our
specification is complimentary to these as it concerns keeping records
and communicating regarding data breach incidents based on regulatory
requirements as outlined in GDPR.</p>
<h2 id="data-breach-specification">Data Breach Specification</h2>
<p>Based on the requirements of the GDPR and its interpretation within
the state of the art as presented in Section 2, we define the following
requirements for information to be provided by the specification:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Information about the existence of a Data Breach i.e. whether it
has occurred, is occurring, or has been mitigated. We term this as
information about the ‘lifecycle’ of the breach – represented in Section
3.1.</p></li>
<li><p>Information about the Data Breach itself i.e. when and where did
it occur, its cause, affected systems, data, and data subjects –
represented in Section 3.2.</p></li>
<li><p>Investigation of the Data Breach i.e. detection report, what has
been affected, who has it been notified to and when – represented in
Section 3.3.</p></li>
<li><p>Notifications i.e. communication between entities, e.g.
Controller to DPA, specifying information available at that point in
time – represented in Section 3.4.</p></li>
<li><p>Impact Assessment i.e. assessing risks to rights and freedoms of
individuals at that point in time – represented in Section 3.5.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="data-breach-lifecycle">Data Breach Lifecycle</h3>
<p>A data breach incident starts when a breach is suspected or detected,
and ends with a final report detailing impacts and mitigation measures
taken. In addition to these, organisational processes may involve
unclear or ambiguous information, for example - where sufficient
information is not available to state whether a breach exists, or where
a breach is suspected but not yet confirmed. We created the following
stages by extending <code>dpv:Status</code> as
<em>DataBreachStatus</em>: <code>DataBreachSuspected</code> represents
the case where a data breach is suspected and requires discovery and
validity of this suspicion to confirm its existence.
<code>DataBreachDetected</code> represents the case where a data breach
has been detected and requires determining whether it has concluded or
is ongoing, and to ascertain its cause, nature, and effect (GDPR Article
33). <code>DataBreachOngoing</code> represents the case where a data
breach is currently in progress and requires identifying measures to
stop the breach. <code>DataBreachHalted</code> and
<code>DataBreachConcluded</code> represent cases where a data breach has
stopped of its own accord and without any mitigations - with ’halted’
indicating a likelihood of being resumed.
<code>DataBreachTerminated</code> represents the case where a data
breach has been stopped through mitigation measures taken in response
and where does not have a likelihood of resuming.
<code>DataBreachMitigated</code> represents the case where potential
similar data breaches have been prevented from recurring through the use
of mitigation measures.</p>
<h3 id="data-breach-event">Data Breach Event</h3>
<p>The data breach ‘<em>event</em>’ represents the occurrence of the
breach, and for which documentation is required to be maintained in
terms of temporal properties i.e. when the breach started and ended - as
its duration. This is indicated using the DCMI Metadata Terms<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. The ‘<em>cause</em>’ of a breach is
the event which led to the breach taking place. It is represented using
the concept <code>Threat</code> and is associated with the breach using
<code>causedByThreat</code> relation. An example of a source of data
breach is where an employee left their office computer unattended
without locking it. The lack of security in securing office machines is
a vulnerability, represented using the concept
<code>Vulnerability</code> and associated using the relation
<code>hasVulnerability</code>. Vulnerabilities represent a weakness or
limitation that was exploited in order to create the source event which
then leads to the data breach. Vulnerabilities are not necessary for a
source to realise, for example an accident can occur without a
vulnerability. The ’<em>source</em>’ of a breach is the actor or
non-actor source that caused the breach to take place through
intentional or unintentional means, and regardless of malicious intent
or accidents. It is represented by <code>ThreatSource</code> and
associated using <code>hasThreatSource</code>. The ‘<em>type</em>’ of a
data breach is based on EDPB’s categorisations as
‘<em>confidentiality</em>’, ‘<em>integrity</em>’, and
‘<em>availability</em>’ based on the effect of the breach .</p>
<h3 id="data-breach-reports">Data Breach Reports</h3>
<p><code>DataBreachReport</code> represents documentation of
information, with further subclasses to represent different reporting
requirements e.g. when breach is detected and is being investigated, and
is classified based on reporting requirements under GDPR as -
preliminary, ongoing, and concluded. A preliminary investigation report
provides details to be reported within 72 hours of the breach being
detected, and is followed up by zero or more ongoing investigation
reports, and a final conclusion report. In reporting data breaches,
authorities specifically ask for the involved Controllers and Processors
which are specified using the relations
<code>dpv:hasDataController</code> and <code>dpv:hasDataProcessor</code>
respectively. In addition, authorities also ask about ‘cross-border’
breaches, which is represented using <code>dpv:hasJurisdiction</code>
and the relevant EU member states.</p>
<h3 id="data-breach-notifications">Data Breach Notifications</h3>
<p><em>DataBreachNotice</em> represents information being communicated
between entities, with specific notices defined for information sent to
an Authority, a Controller, a Processor, or a Data Subject. Metadata
about the notices is represented using DCMI Metadata Terms and
Schema.org vocabularies, e.g. <code>dct:medium</code>,
<code>dct:format</code>, <code>schema:Message</code> to describe an
email being sent. To indicate whether some notifications are being
planned, are ongoing, or have been completed -
<code>dpv:ActivityStatus</code> is to be used.</p>
<h3 id="data-breach-impact-assessment">Data Breach Impact
Assessment</h3>
<p>A Data Breach Impact Assessment (DBIA) is similar to a Data
Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) in that it is undertaken to assess
the risks and impacts to data subjects, where the DPIA is intended to
address a planned process and the DBIA relates to a data breach that has
taken place. A DBIA is essential in order to determine whether to notify
authorities and data subjects regarding the breach, and to plan the
necessary measures to handle the breach. If the DBIA indicates that the
breach is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of
individuals - then the authorities have to be notified. If the DBIA
indicates a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals - then
both the authorities and data subjects have to be notified.</p>
<p>A DBIA is based on the information available at a given time.
Therefore, it can be undertaken at any stage in the breach handling
process - from preliminary where fewer information is known to final
where all information is available. to represent a DBIA, the DPV concept
<code>dpv:ImpactAssessment</code> is extended as
<code>DataBreachImpactAssessment</code>. DCMI terms are used to
represent relevant metadata similar to the breach reports (e.g.
temporal, provenance).</p>
<p>A Data Breach Impact Assessment (DBIA) contains three categories of
information:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Information about the Breach: Type of breach; Nature,
sensitivity, and volume of personal data; Special characteristics of the
individual; Special characteristics of the data controller; Number of
affected individuals.</p></li>
<li><p>Risk Assessment: risks and impacts to rights and freedoms, risk
levels, likelihoods, severity of consequences, and specific risks (e.g.
ease of identification).</p></li>
<li><p>Outcomes: activities to be undertaken based on the
assessment</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The information about the breach in terms of what data or individuals
have been affected is the same as that present in a Data Breach Report,
and therefore can be included through a link to the report itself or
explicitly added to the assessment in a manner similar to that of the
report. Information about the risk assessment includes the specifics of
what risks are applicable, the consequences and impacts arising from it,
their severity and likelihood, and the impacted stakeholders - including
impacts to the rights and freedoms.</p>
<p>Additionally, breach reporting requires information on applicability
of specific risks - such as (re-)identification of individuals through
breached data. To associate these risks, the existing DPV risk
assessment terms are used e.g. wih <code>dpv:hasRisk</code> and
<code>dpv:hasImpact</code>. Where such risks are absent, they are
explicitly declared as <code>dpv:NotApplicable</code>. To specify the
severity and likelihood, we reuse <em>dpv:hasSeverity</em> and
<em>dpv:hasLikelihood</em>. Further information about risk and impact
assessment concepts can be seen in the semantic specification for DPIA
<span class="citation"
data-cites="panditSemanticSpecificationData2022"><a
href="#ref-panditSemanticSpecificationData2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span> which also uses DPV and provides the
necessary concepts which are required in a DPIA and are the same within
a DBIA.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-and-future-directions">Conclusion and Future
Directions</h2>
<p>In this article, we introduced a semantic specification for
representing information about data breaches based on the requirements
of the GDPR. The specification provides a machine-readable vocabulary to
represent information regarding the data breach event, how it was
detected, the consequent analysis of its impact on systems, data, and
data subjects, and its communication to other entities. Through these,
we hope to enable efficient tools and processes to handle obligations
regarding data breaches, and to make communicating about breaches to be
in line with existing cybersecurity methods which already use
interoperable taxonomies and automated tooling.</p>
<p>The specification is a preliminary work that establishes the
framework of information required and requires analysing guidelines and
reporting mechanisms by EU data protection authorities to create a
common pan-EU data breach reporting framework. Through this, consistent
and interoperable tools can be developed to assist stakeholders such as
DPOs and authorities in tasks such as information validation, and to
provide assistance in impact assessments by creating communal ’knowledge
graphs’ to identify relevant risks and impacts similar to existing
security initiatives such as MITRE and VERIS. Finally, as data breaches
are also security incidents, the specification can also be extended for
use with other regulatory requirements such as NIS2 and DORA.</p>
