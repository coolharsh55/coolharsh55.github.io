<p><strong>Abstract</strong> This study investigates the effectiveness of Apple's privacy labels, introduced in iOS 14, in promoting transparency around app data collection practices with respect to the GDPR. Specifically, we address two key research questions: (1) What  special categories of personal data, as regulated by the GDPR, are collected and used by apps, and for which purposes?; and (2) What disparities exist between app-stated permissions and the apparent unnecessary data gathering across various categories in the iOS App Store? By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of 541,662 iOS apps, we identify common practices related to prevalent use of sensitive and special categories of personal data, revealing widespread instances of unnecessary data collection, misuse, and potential GDPR violations. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers significant inconsistencies between the permissions stated by apps and the actual data they gather, highlighting a critical gap in user privacy protection within the iOS ecosystem. These findings underscore the need for stricter regulatory oversight of app stores and the necessity of effective privacy notices to build accountability, trust and ensure transparency. The study offers actionable insights for regulators, app developers, and users towards creating secure and transparent digital ecosystems</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Privacy has become a major problem for society in modern times due to
the pervasiveness of technology in our daily lives. While cellphones and
associated apps have significantly improved communication and
convenience, they have also given rise to serious concerns regarding the
security of personal data. When people use a variety of apps, each
requesting access to their personal information, the opaqueness of the
regulations governing data usage is a serious worry. Privacy regulations
are more important than ever since people are demanding more
transparency and control over their personal data. Nevertheless,
consumers frequently find it difficult to completely understand these
activities due to the complex nature of typical privacy regulations.
Privacy labels surfaced as a possible remedy in reaction to these
issues. Privacy nutrition labels were first introduced by Kelley et al.
<span class="citation" data-cites="kelley1"><a href="#ref-kelley1"
role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span> with the goal of providing a clear
and succinct summary of privacy policies to improve users’ visual
comprehension.</p>
<p>Apple introduced Apple Privacy Labels in the App Store in 2020, and
Google released Data Safety Sections in the Google Play Store soon
after. All software products available on the App Store now have privacy
labels, even desktop applications. However, for the sake of this paper,
we will only be discussing mobile apps. Apple divides data into fourteen
categories, each with a unique name and icon, to make it easier for
developers to summarize how an app handles private, sensitive data.
These data types combine related or comparable pieces of information;
for instance, the Identifiers category includes User ID and Device ID
<span class="citation" data-cites="balash8"><a href="#ref-balash8"
role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span>. Next, the privacy labels page
groups the app’s data practices into three primary categories, each of
which is displayed on a distinct card according to how it is used: "data
used to track you," "data linked to you," and "data not linked to you"
<span class="citation" data-cites="Scoccia6"><a href="#ref-Scoccia6"
role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span>.</p>
<p>These labels are intended to make it easier for end users to
understand how apps handle data <span class="citation"
data-cites="Kollnig5"><a href="#ref-Kollnig5"
role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span>; they provide an alternative to
wading through lengthy privacy rules that are rarely read. But just as
they frequently do with privacy policies, there’s a worry that users may
ignore these new, potentially simplified privacy labels. This could
result in a false sense of security or a lack of awareness regarding the
impact on their privacy, which varies greatly from person to person.
Furthermore, it is possible that developers may fail to disclose their
true data practices if the labels comply with GDPR.</p>
<p>The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), in Article 9,
defines special categories of data, which require
higher protection due to their sensitive nature. These categories
include data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,
religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic
data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural
person, data concerning health, or data concerning a natural person’s
sex life or sexual orientation. The GDPR prohibits the processing of
these categories unless one of the exceptions are fulfilled - such as
asking for explicit consent. The GDPR, in Article 35, also requires
conducting a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to assess the
risks to the ’rights and freedoms’ of individuals that the processing of
such data may produce.</p>
<p>Additionally, from the perspective of individuals, certain categories
are considered particularly sensitive. These include data related to
photos and videos, finance, and navigation. Photos and videos can reveal
a lot about a person’s private life, finance data includes sensitive
information about an individual’s economic activities and status, and
navigation data can track a person’s location and movements. The
importance of protecting such sensitive data highlights the need for
effective privacy labels and regulations to ensure that users are fully
aware of how their data is being collected and used.</p>
<p>The labels also bring up new research concerns, like examining the
effectiveness, usefulness, and usability of the labels in real-world
settings and the discrepancy between the privacy choices that mobile app
users have access to in permission managers and the disclosures made on
the labels. However, there hasn’t been much research done to determine
how well people’s privacy concerns and inquiries are addressed by the
content of the present mobile app privacy labels.</p>
<p>In light of the aforementioned findings, the following research
questions have been identified and are examined in this paper:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What sensitive categories of personal data as might be understood
by individuals, and special categories as regulated by the GDPR, are
collected and used by apps, and for which purposes?</p></li>
<li><p>What disparities exist between app-stated permissions and the
apparent unnecessary data gathering across various app categories in the
iOS App Store?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Privacy labels on Apple’s App Store <span class="citation"
data-cites="apple2020"><a href="#ref-apple2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></span> provide users with clear information
about the data collected by apps, including fourteen distinct types of
data such as identifiers, location data, contact info, user content, and
financial information. These data types, each represented with a unique
name and icon, help users understand what personal information an app
might collect. Data collected by apps is categorized into three main
groups to clarify how personal information is handled (figure 1):</p>
<p>Data Used to Track You: This includes data used for tracking user or
device data across different companies for targeted advertising, such as
browsing history or app usage patterns.</p>
<p>Data Linked to You: This involves data that can be directly tied to
the user’s identity, including account, device, or contact details like
email addresses and phone numbers.</p>
<p>Data Not Linked to You: Covers anonymized data where user identity
references have been removed, such as anonymized usage statistics.</p>
<p>Each category is designed to highlight the varying privacy risks
associated with different types of data usage. The privacy labels also
indicate the purpose behind data collection, which can range from
analytics and app functionality to product personalization and
advertising. Users can find detailed information about the collected
data and its purposes by accessing the "details" section on the privacy
labels page.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/068-data-privacy-labels.jpg" />
<figcaption>An example of Apple’s App Store privacy labels</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With the introduction of iOS 14.5, Apple requires app developers to
seek user consent for tracking through the App Tracking Transparency
(ATT) framework, ensuring users have control over their privacy
settings. Special Categories of Data Under GDPR Article 9 Under the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Article 9 <span
class="citation" data-cites="dpc2024"><a href="#ref-dpc2024"
role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span>, certain personal data are
classified as "special categories" due to their sensitive nature,
requiring enhanced protection. These include data on racial or ethnic
origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, genetic and biometric
data, health information, and data concerning sexual orientation.
Processing such data is generally prohibited unless explicit consent is
obtained or it is necessary for substantial public interest.</p>
<p>In contrast, "sensitive data" refers to personal data that, while not
classified as special under GDPR, still requires protection due to its
nature, such as financial data or contact details. The regulatory
requirements for this data vary depending on the jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Special categories under GDPR are strictly regulated due to their
potential impact on individual rights and freedoms, whereas sensitive
data, though important, does not fall under these stringent GDPR
conditions unless it relates to the defined special categories. This
distinction underlines that while all GDPR special categories are
sensitive, not all sensitive data is categorized as special under
GDPR.</p>
<h3 id="literature-review-state-of-the-art">Literature Review &amp;
State of the Art</h2>
<p>We cover four primary themes in this section’s discussion of material
pertinent to our study: literature about iOS privacy labels, iOS and
Android label comparisons, whether or not privacy labels are helpful to
users and why low popularity apps have missing privacy labels.</p>
<h3 id="ios-privacy-labels">iOS Privacy Labels</h3>
<p>Understanding privacy labels is essential for users to make informed
decisions. The four-level hierarchy of privacy labels provides a
structured way to interpret the information presented. Users can start
by checking the top-level Privacy Types to determine if an app collects
any user data. If an app falls under the "No Data Collected" category,
it means the app does not collect any user data<span class="citation"
data-cites="Rodriguez4"><a href="#ref-Rodriguez4"
role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span>. However, Numerous iOS applications
continue to collect machine data that could be used to track users,
according to Kollnig et al. (2022).According to the survey<span
class="citation" data-cites="Kollnig5"><a href="#ref-Kollnig5"
role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span>, 22.2% of apps said they didn’t
gather user data, a claim that is frequently refuted by more
investigation. Analysis revealed a disparity between stated and actual
practices: 68.6% of these apps transferred data to a monitoring site
upon first start, and 80.2%of these apps contained at least one tracker
library. These apps, on average, had fewer tracking libraries and made
less contact with tracking businesses than those that acknowledged
collecting data; this indicates a notable lack of transparency in
privacy procedures. Paper<span class="citation" data-cites="balash8"><a
href="#ref-balash8" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span> also observed
that on average there were 37450 newly added apps and 38,053 removed
apps per week. During the end of the collection period, 60.5% of apps
had a privacy label and the remaining 39.5% of apps didn’t have privacy
labels. The author has considered the apps that have privacy labels and
noticed that they track user data, which has increased by 3,733 apps on
average each week for a total increase of 47,658 apps.</p>
<p>The number of apps that link data to users’ identities increased by
9,169 apps on average each week for a total increase of 103,886 apps.
But most new apps use the Data Not Collected Privacy Type. These
increased on average 12,597 apps per week for a total increase of
125,333 apps <span class="citation" data-cites="balash8"><a
href="#ref-balash8" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span>. Users have a
difficult time finding apps that are truly concerned about their
privacy, as seen by the limited percentage of these apps that were
featured in the App Store charts. The discrepancy between apps’ stated
permissions and their actual data collection practices offers a critical
entry point for our research on unnecessary data gathering across
various iOS App Store categories. This gap not only raises questions
about the integrity of app privacy disclosures but also underscores the
importance of scrutinising the privacy practices of apps that claim not
to collect data, revealing a crucial area for deeper investigation and
analysis in the quest for genuine transparency and user protection in
digital environments.</p>
<p>It is found that among free applications, 40.55% are used for
developer advertising, 78.92% are used for collecting data and 36.41%
are used for third-party advertising. Free applications perform 2.72
usage of linked data, which are anonymized whereas paid application
performs 0.43 usage of linked data (Scoccia et al. 2022)<span
class="citation" data-cites="Scoccia6"><a href="#ref-Scoccia6"
role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span>. Therefore, it can be said that paid
applications have a better ratio than free applications on the Apple
store.The result section from paper<span class="citation"
data-cites="Li7"><a href="#ref-Li7" role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></span>
shows that 51.6% of iOS applications do not have any privacy labels as
of 2021. Though 35.5% of applications have already generated privacy
labels, just 2.7% of iOS applications have developed privacy labels
without the features of app updates (Li et al. 2022). Even, the changing
rates appear to be slower over time. The overall low level of adoption
in terms of privacy labels makes this label system comparatively less
useful for customers (users). The fact that "half of the iOS
applications have only view labels" underscores a critical problem in
how app developers approach the transparency and disclosure of their
data collection practices. This situation is further compounded by
developers’ passive attitude towards privacy <span class="citation"
data-cites="LiTianshi9"><a href="#ref-LiTianshi9"
role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a></span> and a lack of awareness or
misconceptions about how to create effective privacy labels<span
class="citation" data-cites="Li7"><a href="#ref-Li7"
role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></span>. Such attitudes and
misunderstandings can lead to inadequate compliance with privacy
regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
which is especially critical when it comes to handling sensitive data
categories.</p>
<h3
id="how-developers-talk-about-personal-data-and-what-it-means-for-user-privacy-a-case-study-of-a-developer-forum-on-reddit">How
Developers Talk About Personal Data and What It Means for User Privacy:
A Case Study of a Developer Forum on Reddit</h3>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="LiTianshi9"><a
href="#ref-LiTianshi9" role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a></span> examines the
discussions of personal data by Android developers on the /r/androiddev
forum on Reddit, exploring how these discussions relate to user privacy.
The paper employs qualitative analysis of 207 threads (4,772 unique
posts) to develop a typology of personal data discussions and identify
when privacy concerns arise. The research highlights that developers
rarely discuss privacy concerns in the context of specific app designs
or implementation problems unless prompted by external events like new
privacy regulations or OS updates. When privacy is discussed, developers
often view these issues as burdensome, citing high costs with little
personal benefit.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="LiTianshi9"><a
href="#ref-LiTianshi9" role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a></span> suggest that
privacy-related discussions are reactive rather than proactive among
developers, who tend to address privacy concerns only when they are
forced to do so by external factors. Risky data practices, such as
sharing data with third parties or transferring data off the device, are
frequently mentioned without corresponding discussions on privacy
implications. The study concludes by offering recommendations for
improving privacy practices, such as better communication of privacy
rationales by Android OS and app stores, and encouraging more
privacy-focused discussions in developer forums.</p>
<p>This research contributes to understanding the challenges developers
face regarding privacy and highlights the need for better tools,
guidance, and community practices to support more privacy-conscious app
development. The study underscores the importance of proactive privacy
discussions and offers actionable suggestions for enhancing privacy
practices within the Android development community.</p>
<h3 id="comparison-of-privacy-labels-in-ios-and-google-store">Comparison
of privacy labels in iOS and Google Store</h3>
<p>There has been research that helps us to compare privacy labels in
the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Since these two are different
platforms, privacy label policies also differ. A comparison between
these two platforms can help the users understand how both platforms
handle data collection and privacy practices. The comparison can also
help users understand which platform can help users prioritise their
privacy better</p>
<p>In the research papers <span class="citation"
data-cites="Rodriguez4"><a href="#ref-Rodriguez4"
role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span> and <span class="citation"
data-cites="Khandelwal10"><a href="#ref-Khandelwal10"
role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span>, the authors analysed the privacy
labels on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store to understand how
mobile apps handle user privacy. Research Paper <span class="citation"
data-cites="Rodriguez4"><a href="#ref-Rodriguez4"
role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span>compares the privacy labels on both
platforms however research paper <span class="citation"
data-cites="Khandelwal10"><a href="#ref-Khandelwal10"
role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span> deep dives into the practices that
are reported in privacy labels along with privacy labels comparison on
both platforms. Since both the research papers are based on a comparison
of privacy labels on both platforms it is observed that the paper <span
class="citation" data-cites="Khandelwal10"><a href="#ref-Khandelwal10"
role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span> provides more detailed insights
based on app popularity, age rating, and price as well. Since the
authors were performing the comparison between both platforms, it was
essential first to identify the apps that were present on both
platforms. In paper<span class="citation" data-cites="Rodriguez4"><a
href="#ref-Rodriguez4" role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span> the authors
were able to compare only 822 apps that are present on both the
platforms and the findings showed us that there were mismatches in terms
of data types collected on both IOS and Apple IOS App Store. The precise
location is collected more on IOS and platforms and less on Android
platforms. The approximate location is collected more by Android than
IOS. This tends to explain that IOS is more oriented towards the precise
location and Android is oriented towards the approximate location.
Another mismatch can be seen regarding device ID and user ID. When it
comes to Device ID Android collects it more than IOS and when it comes
to user ID then IOS collects more than Android.</p>
<p>The below figure shows the difference between data types that are
collected for both platforms in the research paper<span class="citation"
data-cites="Rodriguez4"><a href="#ref-Rodriguez4"
role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/068-data-collection.png" />
<figcaption> The number of data items collected in privacy labels based
on 100k apps.<span class="citation" data-cites="Rodriguez4"><a
href="#ref-Rodriguez4" role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As we can see in the above figure 2. there is a big gap between
precise location, coarse location, User ID, and Device ID. Also, when it
comes to sensitive info iOS has only 7 apps that match the disclosing
while the other 16 differ. In the research paper <span class="citation"
data-cites="Khandelwal10"><a href="#ref-Khandelwal10"
role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span> the authors have filtered out the
data and performed a comparison analysis on 100k apps. The authors found
that while comparing the Apple privacy labels with Google Play store
privacy labels 60% of the cross-listed apps had at least one
inconsistency. We further say that inconsistencies are highest for
Sensitive Information, Browsing History, and Emails or Text Messages
data types <span class="citation" data-cites="Khandelwal10"><a
href="#ref-Khandelwal10" role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span>. The
authors have also identified inconsistency where developers are
reporting data collection for two different purposes. In an app called
Twitch TV, the purpose of data type purchase history on Google Play
Store is App Functionality. On the IOS App Store, it is mentioned as
Analytics and Personalization purposes.</p>
<p>The overall conclusion in paper 8 suggests that Apple’s privacy label
does not distinguish between data collection and sharing. Apple’s
privacy label is more explicit about data practices like link ability,
third-party advertising, and tracking. In contrast, data safety sections
lack these details but do inform the users about the safety of their
data (Data Encryption) and the choices that they have with developers
(Data Deletion Option) <span class="citation"
data-cites="Khandelwal10"><a href="#ref-Khandelwal10"
role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span>. In terms of security practices on
Google Play Store, the authors revealed that 23% of apps do not provide
any details of their security practices [10] and 65% of apps encrypt the
data they collect or share while in transit<span class="citation"
data-cites="Khandelwal10"><a href="#ref-Khandelwal10"
role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span>.it was also found that 42% declare
data collection on the Google Play Store, while 58% do so on the iOS
platform.In terms of popularity we have noticed that for the Google play
store, 76% of the high-popularity apps have privacy labels while for
low-popular apps, only 42% have privacy labels. The app KineMaster -
Video Editor, a video editing application with over 400 M+ downloads on
Google Play Store, claims not to collect any data in the Play Store, but
on the App Store, it asserts the collection of sensitive data such as
Location and Identifiers <span class="citation"
data-cites="Khandelwal10"><a href="#ref-Khandelwal10"
role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span>. In terms of price it was noticed
that in Google Play Store 68% of the paid apps have labels, whereas, for
free apps, only 46% have labels when it comes to Apple IOS App Store
similar trend is observed where paid apps have numbers of privacy labels
as compared to free apps <span class="citation"
data-cites="Khandelwal10"><a href="#ref-Khandelwal10"
role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span>. Here we can conclude that apart
from data privacy label comparison, the paper <span class="citation"
data-cites="Khandelwal10"><a href="#ref-Khandelwal10"
role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span> has deep-dived into more granular
details as compared to the paper <span class="citation"
data-cites="Rodriguez4"><a href="#ref-Rodriguez4"
role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span>. Both the research papers have shown
the data practices done on both platforms, however, the authors have not
covered the part whether the data practices that are disclosed by both
platforms are in line with GDPR. Also, the research papers<span
class="citation" data-cites="Rodriguez4"><a href="#ref-Rodriguez4"
role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span>and <span class="citation"
data-cites="Khandelwal10"><a href="#ref-Khandelwal10"
role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span> do not provide any findings that
can help us identify whether any of the apps are performing unnecessary
data collection.</p>
<h3 id="do-privacy-labels-help-users">Do privacy labels help users?</h3>
<p>It is very important to understand whether privacy labels can answer
the questions users have. The main purpose that privacy labels were
introduced is to let the users know the app’s data practices. For the
same, a research paper was published by Shikun Zhang and Norman Sadeh
from Carnegie Mellon University <span class="citation"
data-cites="Zhang3"><a href="#ref-Zhang3"
role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></span> in 2023 to analyse if the privacy
labels can resolve users’ privacy questions. The authors have used a
corpus of questions that were published in a research paper <span
class="citation" data-cites="ravichander11"><a href="#ref-ravichander11"
role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a></span> combining computational and legal
perspectives. The authors first tried to understand the nature of those
questions and transformed them into themes and ended by having 18 themes
and 67 codes. The study aims to evaluate whether the questions asked by
users regarding privacy can be answered using the privacy labels on
Google Play Store and Apple IOS App Store. The authors analysed each
code to determine if questions under each sub-theme could be answered
using the privacy labels provided by Google or Apple. The authors in the
research paper <span class="citation" data-cites="Zhang3"><a
href="#ref-Zhang3" role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></span> found that the
most common questions asked by the users were in relation to data
collection. Other themes comprised app security, data sharing, data
selling, permissions, and app-specific privacy features. it was found
that approximately 40% of question themes could be answered by the
labels. Google Play labels provided more coverage, addressing additional
data types and security-related questions as compared to iOS labels.
However, iOS labels provided more information regarding data selling
practices. Several question themes, such as permissions, data retention,
external access, account requirements, and cookies policy, were not
addressed by either iOS or Google Play labels. These themes represent
areas where users’ privacy concerns may not be adequately addressed by
current label designs. The findings provide insights into potential
improvements needed in label design to better align with users’ mental
models and address their privacy concerns effectively. Based on this
study we saw only 40% of the question themes could be answered by
current privacy labels which shows us that there is still room for
improvement. The research paper <span class="citation"
data-cites="Zhang3"><a href="#ref-Zhang3"
role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></span> indicates that there are
significant gaps in addressing user’s privacy concerns. And thus we will
try to figure out if we can figure out the solution for this gap by
understanding the user perception. In our research, we will be exploring
the formats of privacy labels across different apps and can identify the
inconsistencies. As a part of our research, we will also be doing
campaigns/surveys that will help us understand the user perception and
raise awareness among users in terms of understanding privacy labels,
and empower users to make more informed decisions about their app
usage.</p>
<h3 id="why-low-popularity-apps-have-privacy-labels-missing">Why low
popularity apps have privacy labels missing?</h3>
<p>One striking observation revealed in a research paper <span
class="citation" data-cites="Khandelwal10"><a href="#ref-Khandelwal10"
role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span> shows us that for apps with high
popularity, 76% of them had privacy labels however for apps with low
popularity only 42% of them had privacy labels. While the popular apps
provide robust privacy disclosure, a disparity exists where the apps
with less popularity lack privacy label disclosures. The research paper
<span class="citation" data-cites="Khandelwal10"><a
href="#ref-Khandelwal10" role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span>, makes it
clear that for less popular apps, half of the apps had privacy labels
missing. It brings out the need to analyse the factors that are
influencing privacy labelling practices with apps having less
popularity. The research paper <span class="citation"
data-cites="SBargh12"><a href="#ref-SBargh12"
role="doc-biblioref">[13]</a></span> published in 2022 helps us to
understand the challenges faced by small enterprise businesses about
privacy labels. The authors conducted 3 interviews with 3 SMEs from
sectors of retail, culture, and media. Two sessions were arranged for
each SME where the objective of the 1st session was to introduce the
SMEs to online SERIOUS tools which can help them create a sensible
SERIOUS privacy label. The second session was based on an interview with
each SME where the questions were based on the first session, use of
privacy labels, and Facilitation of the privacy label deployment.</p>
<p>The results of the second session highlighted some points. The first
one showed the authors that since the participants belonged to different
sectors, so should they use separate privacy labels. The second point
that was brought to light is that these SMEs don’t have in-house
capacity for privacy label generation and thus use online third parties.
Also, it was noticed that the SMEs don’t have a specific person who is
responsible for handling privacy labels. The authors have recommended
the need for having the privacy labels of upstream service providers is
to develop automated systems, tools, and architectures that help
estimate the privacy practices/labels based on the operational
behaviours of the corresponding services <span class="citation"
data-cites="SBargh12"><a href="#ref-SBargh12"
role="doc-biblioref">[13]</a></span>. The authors have also mentioned
that the privacy labels and the tools that can be used to develop
privacy labels have to be adopted by both label-issuing enterprises and
label-consuming parties. The authors have also expressed the need for
further research about the possible ways that can be used to enhance
label adoption by label-issuing enterprises.</p>
<p>This research paper shows us that there is still a need for better
privacy labels which can be used by the app owners in order to disclose
the privacy labels. SMEs need to offer transparency to each privacy
practice for SMEs providing online services and applications. Moreover,
it is needed to introduce a trusted party (third party) to monitor and
supervise ongoing processes.</p>
<h3 id="how-usable-are-ios-privacy-labels">How Usable Are iOS Privacy
Labels?</h3>
<p>The literature survey <span class="citation" data-cites="Zhang15"><a
href="#ref-Zhang15" role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></span> provides a
comprehensive analysis of the usability and effectiveness of Apple’s iOS
app privacy labels, introduced with iOS 14, within the broader landscape
of privacy communication. These labels were designed as a more
accessible alternative to traditional privacy policies, which are often
criticized for their length, complexity, and general lack of engagement
from users. The study situates itself within the "Notice and Choice"
framework of U.S. privacy law, which traditionally relies on users being
informed and making choices based on detailed privacy policies.</p>
<p>The survey begins by reviewing key literature on privacy notices,
identifying essential criteria for effective privacy communication:
readability, comprehensibility, salience, relevance, and actionability.
It highlights the shortcomings of traditional privacy policies and
explores the emergence of alternative approaches, such as standardized
and simplified notices, which aim to make privacy information more
digestible and actionable for users.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Zhang15"><a href="#ref-Zhang15"
role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></span> then focuses specifically on the
concept of privacy labels, which are intended to function similarly to
nutrition labels on food products, offering a concise summary of how an
app handles user data. The authors in <span class="citation"
data-cites="Zhang15"><a href="#ref-Zhang15"
role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></span> discuss the theoretical potential
of these labels to improve user understanding and control over their
privacy, particularly in the mobile app ecosystem, where privacy
concerns are especially pertinent.</p>
<p>To evaluate the real-world effectiveness of iOS privacy labels, the
authors conducted an empirical study involving in-depth interviews with
24 iPhone users. The findings reveal a range of user experiences, with
many participants expressing confusion and frustration with the labels.
Despite their intended purpose, the labels often failed to clearly
communicate the necessary information or to empower users to make
informed privacy decisions. Common issues included misunderstandings of
the labels’ content, perceived inconsistencies with app behaviors, and a
general lack of actionable guidance.</p>
<p>The survey concludes by offering recommendations for enhancing the
design and implementation of privacy labels. These include using clearer
and more straightforward language, better integrating the labels with
app permission settings, and refining the visual and interactive aspects
of the labels to make them more user-friendly. The paper’s findings
contribute to the ongoing discussion on improving privacy notice design,
particularly in the context of mobile applications, and highlight the
persistent challenges in creating privacy tools that effectively bridge
the gap between technical information and user understanding.</p>
<h3
id="helping-mobile-application-developers-create-accurate-privacy-labels">Helping
Mobile Application Developers Create Accurate Privacy Labels</h3>
<p>The paper <span class="citation" data-cites="Gardner16"><a
href="#ref-Gardner16" role="doc-biblioref">[15]</a></span> explores the
complex challenge of ensuring that mobile application developers can
produce accurate privacy labels, a requirement introduced by Apple in
December 2020. These privacy labels are designed to inform users about
the data collection and sharing practices of apps they use. However,
many developers struggle to complete these labels accurately due to a
lack of expertise in privacy regulations and the complexities introduced
by third-party Software Development Kits (SDKs) and libraries, which are
often integral to app development.</p>
<p>The authors identify several key obstacles that developers face when
attempting to create these privacy labels. One significant issue is the
difficulty in understanding the data collection behaviors of third-party
components within their apps. These components can introduce data
practices that developers might not be fully aware of, leading to
inaccuracies in the privacy labels. Additionally, developers often lack
the necessary privacy expertise to correctly interpret and implement the
requirements for these labels, resulting in widespread inaccuracies that
could have legal, regulatory, and reputational consequences.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, the authors developed and evaluated a
tool called Privacy Label Wiz (PLW). PLW is an enhanced version of an
earlier tool, Privacy Flash Pro, and is designed to help iOS developers
create more accurate privacy labels by integrating static code analysis
with interactive user prompts. The tool scans the app’s codebase to
identify potential data collection practices and then guides the
developer through a series of questions and prompts to clarify and
confirm these practices. This process is intended to help developers
better understand their apps’ data flows and ensure that the privacy
labels they produce accurately reflect these practices.</p>
<p>The paper <span class="citation" data-cites="Gardner16"><a
href="#ref-Gardner16" role="doc-biblioref">[15]</a></span> details the
iterative development process of PLW, which involves gathering feedback
from semi-structured interviews with developers. These interviews
provided valuable insights into the difficulties developers face and
informed several key design decisions for PLW. For example, the tool was
designed to integrate seamlessly into the developers’ existing
workflows, minimizing disruption and making it easier for developers to
use it effectively. The authors also discuss the tool’s evaluation,
which showed that PLW could significantly improve the accuracy of the
privacy labels generated by developers.</p>
<p>In addition to describing the tool and its development, the paper
makes several broader contributions to privacy engineering. It
highlights the need for tools that are tailored to the specific
challenges developers face when working with privacy regulations and
underscores the importance of aligning these tools with typical software
development practices. The paper concludes with suggestions for future
work, including further refinement of tools like PLW and expanding
support for other mobile platforms beyond iOS.</p>
<p>Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of providing developers
with the right tools and resources to help them navigate the
complexities of privacy regulations, thereby improving the accuracy of
privacy labels and enhancing user trust in mobile applications.</p>
<h3 id="keeping-privacy-labels-honest">Keeping Privacy Labels
Honest</h3>
<p>Paper <span class="citation" data-cites="Koch17"><a
href="#ref-Koch17" role="doc-biblioref">[16]</a></span> explores the
effectiveness and reliability of Apple’s privacy labels, which were
introduced in December 2020. These labels require app developers to
disclose the types of data their apps collect and the purposes for which
the data is used. The study primarily investigates whether these privacy
labels accurately reflect the data collection practices of the apps and
whether developers comply with these self-declared labels. The authors
conducted an exploratory statistical analysis of 11,074 apps across 22
categories from the German App Store. They found that a significant
number of apps either did not provide privacy labels or self-declared
that they did not collect any data. A subset of 1,687 apps was selected
for a "no-touch" traffic collection study. This involved analyzing the
data transmitted by these apps to determine if it matched the
information disclosed in their privacy labels. The study revealed that
at least 276 of these apps violated their privacy labels by transmitting
data without declaring it. The paper <span class="citation"
data-cites="Koch17"><a href="#ref-Koch17"
role="doc-biblioref">[16]</a></span> also assessed the apps’ compliance
with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), particularly
regarding the display of privacy consent forms. Numerous potential
violations of GDPR were identified. The authors developed infrastructure
for large-scale iPhone traffic interception and a system for
automatically detecting privacy-label violations through traffic
analysis. <span class="citation" data-cites="Koch17"><a
href="#ref-Koch17" role="doc-biblioref">[16]</a></span> concluded that
Apple’s privacy labels are often inaccurate, with many apps transmitting
data not disclosed in their labels. The findings suggest that there is
no validation of these labels during the Apple App Store approval
process, leading to potential privacy violations and non-compliance with
GDPR. The paper emphasizes the need for more rigorous enforcement and
verification of privacy labels to protect users’ data effectively. This
study provides a critical evaluation of the effectiveness of privacy
labels and highlights significant gaps in their implementation and
enforcement.</p>
<h3
id="atlas-automatically-detecting-discrepancies-between-privacy-policies-and-privacy-labels">ATLAS:
Automatically Detecting Discrepancies Between Privacy Policies and
Privacy Labels</h3>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Jain18"><a href="#ref-Jain18"
role="doc-biblioref">[17]</a></span> introduces a novel tool, ATLAS
(Automated Privacy Label Analysis System), which is designed to identify
discrepancies between privacy policies and privacy labels in iOS apps
using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The study
reveals a concerning finding 88% of the apps analyzed with both
available privacy policies and labels exhibit at least one discrepancy,
with an average of 5.32 potential issues per app. These discrepancies
often involve the types of data collected, the purposes for data use,
and data-sharing practices, pointing to significant gaps between what
apps disclose in their privacy labels and what is outlined in their
privacy policies.</p>
<p>ATLAS serves as a critical resource for developers, regulators, and
researchers, providing a way to automatically detect and address these
inconsistencies, thereby improving privacy transparency and compliance
in the mobile app ecosystem. The study highlights the potential of ATLAS
to enhance user trust by ensuring that privacy labels accurately reflect
the practices detailed in privacy policies, thus supporting regulatory
efforts to protect user privacy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <span class="citation" data-cites="Jain18"><a
href="#ref-Jain18" role="doc-biblioref">[17]</a></span> underscores the
importance of addressing the identified discrepancies to improve the
accuracy of privacy disclosures in mobile apps. The researchers suggest
that ATLAS could be further developed to cover more platforms and
languages, potentially broadening its impact. They also call for
stronger regulatory oversight to ensure that privacy labels are not just
a formality but a true reflection of an app’s data practices. The
authors believe that by using tools like ATLAS, the industry can move
towards greater transparency and accountability, ultimately fostering a
more privacy-respecting digital environment.</p>
<h3 id="study-design">Study Design</h2>
<p>The main aim of our study is to explore how iOS apps on the Apple App
Store handle special data, sensitive data, providing insights that can
aid regulators, app store management, and users in making
better-informed decisions.The study consist of 541,662 apps published on
iOS app store as of November 2023. The goal of this study is to analyse
Privacy labels to identify any limitation it poses .</p>
<p>Initially, we conducted a literature review to identify existing
research papers on privacy labels. Although we found relevant studies,
none of them included attached data. This led us to contact other
academics who were also collecting data from the Apple App Store. These
academics provided us with data in JSON format, collected in November
2023, encompassing privacy information for 541,662 iOS apps. Each app’s
privacy details are stored in separate JSON files, specifying the
categories of data collected. To promote further research, we will
upload this data to GitHub in the interest of reproducibility and
further reuse of the data.</p>
<p>The JSON files we received comprised 561,422 individual JSON files
for each app. We developed a Python function to extract information from
these JSON files and convert it into a structured format suitable for
analysis, combining respective fields such as data linked to you, data
not linked to you, and data tracking you. This process involved parsing
each JSON file to identify various privacy-related aspects, such as the
types of data collected (e.g., location, contact info), the purposes of
data collection (e.g., analytics, app functionality), and the categories
of data usage (e.g., data used to track you, data linked to you, data
not linked to you). We then used binary encoding to indicate the
presence or absence of specific data types and purposes within each
app’s privacy label. For instance, if an app collected location data, it
was encoded as ’1’; otherwise, it was encoded as ’0’. Similarly, data
used for analytics was encoded as ’1’ if applicable. The encoded data
was then stored in a .csv file for further analysis.</p>
<p>The choice of binary encoding was driven by its simplicity and
clarity, which aids in straightforward statistical analyses and
visualizations, and ensures consistency across the dataset, making
comparisons between different apps and categories feasible.
Additionally, this method enhances analytical flexibility, allowing for
various analytical techniques such as frequency analysis,
cross-tabulations, and visual representations. This comprehensive
approach enables a thorough examination of data practices. Lastly, the
encoded data in .csv file was stored in an SQLite database, which
facilitated efficient querying and management, helping aggregate data
and extract meaningful insights regarding privacy practices across
different app categories.</p>
<p>The collected and structured data was then analysed by identifying
specific queries through analysis of the literature and performing a
requirements analysis. In this exercise, we analysed the information
available to us in the app store and the privacy label, and formulated
questions whose answers would illuminate the state of data collection
and privacy within the app’s use of data and the impact on privacy. To
ensure the questions were diverse and reflected a well-grounded approach
in research, we compared them with existing literature that analysed iOS
apps to identify which questions were repeated (as in prior work had
also investigated them) and which were novel. For the questions that
were repeated, we sought to validate existing analysis in terms of
findings, and for novel ones we attempted to formulate theories as to
their reason for occurrences and impacts.</p>

<p>In summary, while both special categories (Medical and Health and
Fitness) and sensitive categories (Finance, Photo and Video, and
Navigation) prioritize app functionality and developer advertising,
their focus and distribution patterns vary. The Medical category is
heavily skewed towards advertising, with minimal emphasis on
personalization and other purposes. The Health and Fitness category
balances its data usage across functionality, analytics, and
personalization, with a smaller proportion dedicated to advertising. In
contrast, the sensitive categories like Finance, Photo and Video, and
Navigation exhibit a more varied distribution, reflecting different
operational, marketing, and user engagement strategies employed by apps
in these categories. These differences highlight the distinct approaches
taken by apps in managing and utilizing user data to meet their specific
operational and marketing objectives.</p>
<p>In the landscape of iOS app categories, Medical and Health and
Fitness apps stand out for their notably high data collection practices.
These categories gather significantly more data compared to other app
categories such as Finance, Navigation, and Photo and Video. This trend
suggests a strong emphasis on analytics, app functionality, and
advertising, leading to privacy concerns among users. The findings
reveal that Medical and Health and Fitness apps collect significantly
more data—almost 10-15 times more than Navigation and Photo and Video
apps. Such extensive data collection raises serious privacy concerns,
underlining the need for app developers to adopt transparent data usage
policies and enhance user consent mechanisms. Users are advised to
exercise caution with permissions and settings when using these apps due
to their high data collection rates.</p>

<p>While both special categories (Medical and Health and Fitness) and
sensitive categories (Finance, Photo and Video, and Navigation)
prioritize app functionality and developer advertising, their focus and
distribution patterns vary. The Medical category is more focused on app
functionality and analytics, with minimal emphasis on advertising and
other purposes. The Health and Fitness category balances its data usage
across functionality, analytics, and personalization, with a smaller
proportion dedicated to advertising. In contrast, the sensitive
categories like Finance, Photo and Video, and Navigation exhibit a more
varied distribution, reflecting different operational, marketing, and
user engagement strategies employed by apps in these categories. These
differences highlight the distinct approaches taken by apps in managing
and utilizing user data to meet their specific operational and marketing
objectives.</p>

<p>The analysis reveals distinct patterns in data usage for tracking
users across different categories. In the special categories, the
Medical category primarily uses identifiers and usage data, reflecting a
focus on personal identification and user interaction. Similarly, the
Health and Fitness category is dominated by identifiers and usage data,
with additional emphasis on diagnostics and contact information to
monitor and enhance user experience. In the sensitive categories,
Finance relies heavily on identifiers and usage data, essential for
secure and efficient financial transactions, with significant roles for
diagnostics and location data to ensure operational efficiency. The
Photo and Video category also sees identifiers and usage data as
predominant, highlighting the need for user identification and
interaction tracking, while diagnostics and location data support app
performance and user engagement. The additional Finance category mirrors
this distribution, with identifiers and usage data as the largest
segments, crucial for secure financial operations and user experience
monitoring. These differences highlight the distinct approaches taken by
apps in managing and utilizing user data to meet their specific
operational and marketing objectives.</p>
<h3
id="rq2-disparity-between-app-stated-permissions-and-apparent-unnecessary-data-gathering">RQ2:
Disparity Between App-Stated Permissions and Apparent Unnecessary Data
Gathering</h3>
<p>To address RQ2, we began by analyzing a comprehensive set of app
categories available on the iOS App Store. Our study encompasses a total
of 25 distinct app categories, including Books, Music, Travel, Social
Networking, Shopping, Games, Entertainment, Reference, Medical,
Lifestyle, Sports, Finance, Education, Business, News, Navigation,
Health and Fitness, Photo and Video, Utilities, Productivity, Food and
Drink, Graphics and Design, Weather, Magazines and Newspapers, and
Developer Tools. This broad classification enables us to explore data
tracking practices across a wide array of application types, providing a
thorough examination of how different categories justify or do not
justify their data collection practices. By considering such a diverse
range of app categories, we aim to gain a nuanced understanding of data
tracking trends and justifications within the mobile app ecosystem.</p>
<p>Categories such as Sports, Education, Books, Medical, Business, News,
Utilities, Reference, Productivity, Graphics and Design, Magazines and
Newspapers, and Developer Tools typically do not require location
tracking to deliver their core functionalities. Therefore, we
specifically examined the data tracking practices for apps within these
categories using the dataset from the iOS App Store’s "Data Used to
Track You" feature. The rationale behind excluding location tracking for
these categories is that their primary functions are not inherently
dependent on geographic information. For instance, an app designed for
productivity or reference purposes does not need to access a user’s
location to offer its services effectively. By focusing on these
categories, we aimed to identify and understand the types of data that
are being collected and assessed whether such practices align with the
actual needs of the app’s functionality.</p>
<p>Additionally, we also investigated categories such as Travel, Social
Networking, Entertainment, Navigation, Health and Fitness, Photo and
Video, and Weather. Although location tracking may seem justifiable for
some of these categories, we assessed them to determine whether it was
indeed necessary or overextended. Our analysis aimed to reveal the
extent and nature of data tracking within these categories to understand
better how often location data is collected and whether its use aligns
with the intended functionality of the apps.</p>
<h4 id="justification-for-tracking">Justification for Tracking</h4>
<p><strong>Books:</strong> The justified data tracking includes usage
data, identifiers, purchases, and diagnostics. However, the unjustified
tracking includes location (18.83%), contact info (8.83%), other data
(3.83%), browsing history (2%), sensitive info (0.17%), and financial
info (0.17%). The high percentage of location tracking is especially
concerning, as book apps typically do not need location data to function
effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Music:</strong> The justified data tracking consists of usage
data, identifiers, user content, purchases, and diagnostics. However,
the high percentages of location (38.17%) and contact info (5.52%)
tracking are unjustified, given that music apps generally do not need
such data. Additionally, other data (3.27%), browsing history (1.52%),
search history (1.31%), contacts (0.15%), financial info (0.07%), and
sensitive info (0.07%) also appear to be tracked unnecessarily.</p>
<p><strong>Games:</strong> The justified data tracking consists of usage
data, identifiers, contact info, user content, purchases, diagnostics,
and location. However, the tracking of location (33.69%), other data
(16%), browsing history (0.68%), search history (0.40%), financial info
(0.24%), contacts (0.09%), sensitive info (0.06%), and health &amp;
fitness (0.04%) is largely unjustified for game apps.</p>
<p><strong>Reference:</strong> The justified data tracking consists of
usage data, identifiers, contact info, user content, purchases, and
diagnostics. However, tracking location (40.35%), other data (3.53%),

<h3 id="identified-issues-in-privacy-labels-and-app-listings">Identified
Issues in Privacy Labels and App Listings</h3>
<h4 id="missing-privacy-policy-url">Missing privacy Policy URL</h4>
<p>Out of a total of 541,662 iOS apps analyzed, 237 apps were identified
to have a significant gap in their privacy labels. Specifically, these
237 apps are categorized under "data linked to you" and "data tracking
you," yet they lack the mandatory privacy policy URLs. This omission
raises several critical concerns regarding user privacy and compliance
with regulatory standards.</p>
<h4 id="missing-privacy-labels">Missing privacy labels</h4>
<p>Among the 541,662 iOS apps that were examined, 83,618 were found to
have no privacy labels at all. This significant discrepancy suggests
that user data management procedures lack openness and compliance on a
widespread basis. To promote openness and build user trust, privacy
labels are crucial for telling consumers about the data that apps
collect and how it is used.</p>
<h3 id="user-survey-on-app-usage-and-privacy-concerns">User Survey on
App Usage and Privacy Concerns</h2>
<p>To identify how our analyis of the privacy labels correponded to
actual use of apps by individuals, we created a user survey to identify
which apps are commonly used by people and what privacy concerns that
have. Through this survey, we hoped to identify which of our analysed
privacy labels - and their shortcomings - had the most impact on
individuals, and which of the identified privacy concerns were
legitimate and could be addressed by the privacy label.</p>
<p>This study focused on people between the ages of 20 and 35 to
identify app usage trends and privacy issues among Irish app users. This
particular age range was selected to provide important insights into the
habits and privacy concerns of this digitally active demographic of
young adults who are frequently early adopters of technology and digital
trends. Fifty individuals in this age range who lived in Ireland
participated in the study to precisely document the preferences and
behaviors specific to this demographic. Online questionnaires were used
to gather data, and to successfully reach and engage the intended
audience, the surveys were distributed via social media platforms.
Quantitative techniques were used in the response analysis to enable a
thorough investigation of common app usage patterns and major privacy
issues among those taking part.</p>
<p>A number of the respondents’ primary privacy concerns are highlighted
in the poll responses. The following lists the main privacy issues in
brief:</p>
<p><strong>Most Used Categories of Apps</strong></p>
<figure>
<img src="img/068-popular-apps.png" />
<figcaption>Most Used Categories of Apps</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The survey reveals the most frequently used categories of apps among
respondents: Social Media: 63.6% of respondents primarily use social
media apps, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and
Snapchat.Entertainment:17.1% favor entertainment apps, including
streaming services and gaming apps.Shopping:7.3% of respondents
predominantly use shopping apps. News and Information, Health and
Fitness, Travel and Navigation: Each of these categories is used by 2.4%
of respondents, indicating a lower frequency of use compared to other
app categories.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/068-privacy-concerns.png" />
<figcaption>Concern About Privacy</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Concern About Privacy</strong> The degree of concern about
privacy among app users is as follows: Very Concerned: 48.8% of
respondents are very concerned about their personal information’s
privacy. Somewhat Concerned: 46.3% express some concern, showing that a
significant majority hold reservations about privacy. Other Levels of
Concern: A minority are slightly concerned, neutral, or not concerned,
underlining that privacy remains a predominant issue for most.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/068-familiarity.png" />
<figcaption>Familiarity with Privacy Labels</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Familiarity with Privacy Labels</strong> Respondents’
familiarity with privacy labels in the iOS App Store is categorized as
follows: Very Familiar: 39% are well-acquainted with the privacy
labels.Heard of Them but dont know much: 43.9% have heard of them but
lack detailed knowledge.Not Familiar: 17.1% are not familiar with
privacy labels, suggesting a need for increased awareness and
educational efforts. Many respondents have expressed significant
concerns about the privacy of their personal information while using
apps. Specifically, they are worried about how their data is collected,
stored, and used. Key concerns include the types of data being
collected, the potential for this data to be shared with third parties,
and how securely the data is stored to prevent access or breaches.
Additionally, there is apprehension regarding whether apps track users’
activities across other applications and services, and whether these
practices comply with existing privacy regulations. To address these
concerns, respondents are seeking greater transparency about privacy
practices and more control over their data through app settings. This
indicates a strong desire for assurances that apps are adhering to legal
and ethical standards in handling personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Detailed App Analysis</strong> In response to the survey, we
conducted a detailed analysis of the three most frequently mentioned
apps by our respondents, which collectively represent 55% of the total
usage among participants: Leap Top Up, TFI Live, and AIB. Here’s a brief
overview of each app: Leap Top Up is an application that allows users to
manage their Leap Card, a smart card used for public transportation
across Ireland. It provides functionalities such as easy top-ups and
balance checks without tracking user data, catering to privacy-conscious
consumers. TFI Live, operated by Transport for Ireland, offers real-time
bus route information and uses a user’s location to provide relevant
route directions, but it does not engage in continuous location
tracking. This approach prioritizes user privacy and challenges the
conventional norms of location-based services. Lastly, the AIB app from
Allied Irish Banks delivers a comprehensive suite of mobile banking
services, including balance checks, fund transfers, and bill payments.
It is specifically designed to protect user data and ensure transaction
security without tracking user activities, thus building trust among its
users. These apps demonstrate how various sectors are increasingly
considering user privacy in their service offerings.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-future-work">Conclusion &amp; Future Work</h2>
<p>This work analysed a large corpus of iOS apps (n=541,662) and
identified the prevalence of sensitive and special categories of
personal data being used based on the application of the GDPR. Our work
shows how a large amount of apps use such sensitive/special categories
and in many cases do so without a sufficient apparent justification for
why the app needs to use that information. Our work also shows the
prevalence of using these categories to track individuals without any
transparent information - in contravention of the requirements from
GDPR.</p>
<p>The study identifies significant flaws in the implementation of iOS
privacy labels, revealing substantial data collection under the guise of
app functionality and data analytics, with the health and fitness
category posing particular concerns due to high levels of data
collection linked and unlinked to users. Such excessive data gathering
poses a grave risk if breached, potentially leading to misuse of
sensitive health information, identity theft, fraud, and unwanted
exposure of private data, as underscored by the 2018 MyFitnessPal breach
compromising 150 million accounts. Users must proactively safeguard
their data by managing app permissions, reviewing privacy labels before
downloading apps, and disabling the "Allow Apps to Request to Track"
option in privacy settings. Additionally, the study observed unjustified
location tracking in categories such as sports, education, and business.
The TFI Live app serves as a positive example of delivering
location-based services without intrusive tracking, suggesting many apps
engage in unnecessary data collection practices. This calls for Apple’s
App Store to bolster its app review process, ensuring developers provide
compelling justifications for location tracking, with regular audits to
ensure compliance with privacy standards.</p>
<p>Our research advances the state of the art by providing an empirical
analysis of data collection practices across app categories, confirming
and extending the findings of previous work by Scoccia et al.
(2022)<span class="citation" data-cites="Scoccia6"><a
href="#ref-Scoccia6" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span>. We highlight
inconsistencies in privacy labels and user behavior regarding privacy
settings, emphasizing the need for improved transparency and user
vigilance. In conclusion, our study underscores the urgent need for
better privacy practices in the app ecosystem, offering insights and
recommendations to create a more secure and privacy-conscious
environment, ultimately aiming to enhance user trust and protect
sensitive information from potential breaches and misuse.</p>
<p><strong>Future Work</strong> This study has identified numerous areas
that should be the focus of future research. First and foremost,
longitudinal studies are required to assess how privacy label efficacy
changes over time and impact developer practices and user behavior.
Furthermore, broadening the scope of the investigation to encompass a
greater number of app categories would offer a more thorough
understanding of data-gathering procedures used throughout the App
Store. Examining different privacy label designs and user education
techniques could improve knowledge and control over app permissions. The
effects of improved app review procedures and regulatory modifications
on privacy label accuracy and developer compliance should also be
investigated in future studies. Lastly, researching how well-publicized
data breaches affect user privacy settings and trust could provide
information about how to increase security and transparency.</p>
