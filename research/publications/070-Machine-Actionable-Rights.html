<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The EU GDPR is a landmark regulation that introduced several rights for individuals to obtain information and control how their personal data is being processed, as well as receive a copy of it. However, there are gaps in the effective use of rights due to each organisation developing custom methods for rights declaration and management.
Simultaneously, there is a technological gap as there is no single consistent standards-based mechanism that can automate the handling of rights for both organisations and individuals.
In this article, we present a specification for exercising and managing rights in a machine-interpretable format based on semantic web standards.
Our approach uses the comprehensive Data Privacy Vocabulary to create a streamlined workflow for individuals to understand what rights exist, how and where to exercise them, and for organisations to effectively manage them.
This work pushes the state of the art in GDPR rights management and is crucial for data reuse and rights management under technologically intensive developments, such as Data Spaces.</p>

<h2 id="sec:intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <span class="citation"
data-cites="gdpr"><a href="#ref-gdpr"
role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span> grants data subjects a set of rights
designed to protect their personal data and to ensure that they have
greater control over how their data is collected, processed, and used by
organisations. These rights include the right to access personal data,
the right to rectification of inaccurate data, the right to erasure, and
the right to data portability, which allows individuals to ask for their
data to be transferred between data controllers. Additionally, the GDPR
provides rights to restrict processing, object to data use, and avoid
automated decision-making. These rights, combined with the transparency
and accountability measures imposed on organisations, aim to strike a
balance between the interests of data subjects and the legitimate needs
of businesses and institutions in the digital age. However, despite the
comprehensive rights granted to individuals under regulations such as
the GDPR, a ‘technological gap’, i.e., a significant lack of efficient
tools, for exercising these rights remains <span class="citation"
data-cites="bernes_enhancing_2022"><a href="#ref-bernes_enhancing_2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span>, with many organisations struggling
to provide accessible, user-friendly mechanisms for individuals to
manage their personal data, often relying on cumbersome manual
processes, which can lead to delays, or even non-compliance.</p>
<p>In this context, we present a specification to express information
regarding rights exercise and management in a machine-interpretable
format, using semantic Web standards. In doing so, we begin to address
the automation, interoperability and standardisation challenges
identified above, towards enabling the development of tools for
assisting individuals and organisations in right exercising activities.
Towards achieving this goal, we reuse and extend the Data Privacy
Vocabulary (DPV) <span class="citation"
data-cites="panditCreatingVocabularyData2019 pandit2024dpv"><a
href="#ref-panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a>, <a href="#ref-pandit2024dpv"
role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span>, which allows the expression of
information related to legislative requirements such as the GDPR, to
express information about: (i) linking personal data processing
activities to applicable rights, (ii) providing notices related to said
rights, (iii) documenting the exercise of rights, and (iv) GDPR rights
requests. The resulting specification is being developed in the context
of the W3C Data Privacy Vocabularies and Controls Community Group
(DPVCG).</p>
<p>The remaining of the article is structured as follows: Section <a
href="#sec:sota" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:sota">2</a> provides background information on
GDPR’s data subject rights and existing Web standards for rights
management, Section <a href="#sec:rights" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:rights">3</a> presents the developed specification,
and Section <a href="#sec:conclusions" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:conclusions">4</a> concludes and presents future
directions of work.</p>
<h2 id="sec:sota">Background and State of the Art</h2>
<p>GDPR’s data subject rights are provided on Chapter III, with Articles
12 and 23 listing requirements for and exceptions to the exercising of
rights, respectively, and with Articles 13 to 22 concretely defining
them. In essence, these rights involve the flow of information between a
data subject and a data controller. After confirming receipt of the data
subject’s request, the controller must verify the identity of the data
subject before proceeding with it. If the controller is unable to
identify the data subject, additional information must be provided by
the data subject to enable identification. If the controller has a valid
justification for not fulfilling the right, the data subject must be
informed of such justification. In cases where the request is complex or
there are a large number of requests, the controller is granted a
2-month extension to fulfill the request. If the controller fails to
meet its obligations at any point, a GDPR breach occurs. The European
Data Protection Board also endorsed and issued guidelines to assist on
data subject rights <span class="citation"
data-cites="european_data_protection_board_guidelines_2023 article_29_data_protection_working_party_guidelines_2017 sis_ii_supervision_coordination_group_schengen_2023"><a
href="#ref-european_data_protection_board_guidelines_2023"
role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a>–<a
href="#ref-sis_ii_supervision_coordination_group_schengen_2023"
role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span>.</p>
<p>Even though the existence of these rights has been brought forward
has a huge step for individuals empowerment over their personal data, no
standards have been defined for the management of rights. An exception
to this statement might be the ‘Data Rights Protocol’<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>,
which defines a protocol for rights request/response data flows, without
however covering all GDPR rights and without using standard
vocabularies. Since semantic technologies promote interoperability,
allowing information and its interpretability to be consistently defined
across different platforms, we will adapt the usage of semantic Web
standards for the definition of a specification to express rights
exercising and management. As such, DPV<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a><span class="citation"
data-cites="panditCreatingVocabularyData2019 pandit2024dpv"><a
href="#ref-panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a>, <a href="#ref-pandit2024dpv"
role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span> is the main driver of the
specification presented in this work, as it is the most comprehensive
data protection-related vocabulary, providing a set of taxonomies for
the expression of metadata related to the usage of personal data aligned
with legal requirements, e.g., the GDPR. Additionally, ODRL <span
class="citation" data-cites="iannella_odrl_2018"><a
href="#ref-iannella_odrl_2018" role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></span>,
DCAT <span class="citation" data-cites="albertoni_dcat_2024"><a
href="#ref-albertoni_dcat_2024" role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a></span>,
DCMI <span class="citation" data-cites="dcmi_2020"><a
href="#ref-dcmi_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span>, and
PROV-O <span class="citation" data-cites="lebo_prov_2013"><a
href="#ref-lebo_prov_2013" role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></span>, which
are Web standards developed and promoted by the W3C, are also used to
express information about policies, catalogs of resources, metadata and
activity provenance information, respectively.</p>
<h2 id="sec:rights">Rights Exercise and Management</h2>
<p>Based on the GDPR provisions identified above, the following
requirements are addressed in our specification:</p>
<div class="inlineabc">
<p>information about the existence of rights and justifications for the
exercising of said rights,</p>
<p>notices related to the fulfilment or non-fulfilment of rights,</p>
<p>records of rights-related activities, and</p>
<p>rights requests as machine-executable policies.</p>
</div>
<p>The work is publicly available<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> and includes modelled
examples for each requirement identified above.</p>
<h3 id="sec:applicable-rights">Applicable Data Subject Rights and
Justifications</h3>
<p>Beyond jurisdiction-dependence, applicable data subject rights also
depend on the legal ground used to process personal data. In the case of
the GDPR, DPV’s GDPR extension<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> contains the terms to
represent the rights available under GDPR, as well as a mapping of which
rights are applicable based on the used legal basis. Apart from
detailing information about what personal data is being processed, how,
where, by whom, and for what purpose, a <code>dpv:Process</code> can
also be used to indicate applicable rights. Data controllers can use
this approach to express which rights apply, including those beyond
GDPR, such as the EU’s fundamental rights and rights outlined in other
EU regulations or jurisdictions, i.e., the <code>dpv:hasScope</code>
property can be used to indicate applicable rights by jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Moreover, as a result of the collection of requirements for GDPR
rights exercising, a <code>Justification</code> taxonomy<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, to
provide reasons or explanations related to the fulfilment,
non-fulfilment, delay and exercise of rights, was developed. Examples of
justifications include individual’s identity not being verifiable or a
request being considered overly excessive. Justifications can also
explain why certain processes are necessary or being delayed, such as
the ground to exercise the right to object or requiring additional
information to move forward with a process. To facilitate the expression
of these justifications, this extension introduces concepts that extend
DPV’s <code>Justification</code> concept. Moreover, since such concepts
can be reused for other data protection-related activities, e.g., data
breach reports, the concepts were defined in a generic way so that they
can be reused in distinct contexts.</p>
<h3 id="sec:notices">Notices related to the fulfilment or non-fulfilment
of rights</h3>
<p>Right exercise notices should inform data subjects about where and
how to exercise a right, what information is needed, or provide updates
on a submitted right request. DPV’s <code>isExercisedAt</code> property
can be used to link rights to specific exercise points, e.g., through
right exercise notices, and to connect the required information with a
process using DPV’s <code>hasProcess</code> property. DPV’s
<code>hasRecipient</code>, <code>hasStatus</code>, and
<code>hasJustification</code> properties can be employed to update the
data subject on the status of their right exercising activity, including
any justification for why the right is being exercised. In addition,
DCMI’s concepts can be reused to indicate temporal and other metadata
information related to notices<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. The notices should also
provide information about the data controller, as well as the entity
responsible for implementing the notice.</p>
<p>Notices specifically informing about the fulfilment, progress toward
fulfilment, or non-fulfilment of a right can also be modelled with DPV.
Actions required by entities to fulfil a rights-related request, which
cannot be fully detailed using DPV– such as issuing payment terms –can
be attached to these notices, e.g., using ODRL policies. For
GDPR-specific notices, the GDPR extension offers concepts for both
direct and indirect data collection notices, as required by Arts. 13 and
14, and it also includes Subject Access Request notices to fulfil the
GDPR Right of Access, and recipient notices to meet the notification
requirements of Art. 19.</p>
<h3 id="sec:records">Records of rights-related activities</h3>
<p>Recording provenance information when a specific instance of a right
has been or is being exercised is valuable for data controllers, as it
tracks information about the status and fulfilment of requests, which
can be useful, e.g., for auditors. To represent specific records of
rights being exercised, DPV’s <code>RightExerciseRecord</code> can be
used to link a particular request, or multiple requests from the same
data subject, with the corresponding activities, i.e.,
<code>dpv:RightExerciseActivity</code>, carried out by entities to
fulfil those requests. These records can also leverage the DCAT standard
for representing data catalogues, i.e., <code>dcat:Catalog</code>, with
right exercise activities represented as <code>dcat:Resource</code>,
which can be grouped and organised using
<code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code>. This approach offers the advantage of
utilising DCAT’s ordering properties, such as <code>dcat:first</code>,
<code>dcat:last</code>, and <code>dcat:prev</code>, to easily track and
retrieve the most recent activity related to a specific rights
request.</p>
<p>In this context, a <code>dpv:RightExerciseActivity</code> represents
a specific instance of an activity carried out in the process of
exercising a right. These activity instances should include metadata,
e.g., timestamps and involved entities, to track the provenance of the
right exercising process. To track the status of rights exercising
activities, DPV provides <code>RequestStatus</code> concepts, such as
<code>RequestAccepted</code> for accepted requests moving toward
fulfilment or <code>RequestRequiresAction</code> for requests requiring
further action from another party. Once a request is initiated, it
should be acknowledged by the responsible entity and either accepted for
fulfilment or rejected. If rejected, the entity may require additional
actions from the requester (e.g., providing more information to
proceed), which can delay the acceptance or rejection. After the
required action is taken, the request may either be accepted for
fulfilment, rejected again, or further action may be requested.
Moreover, DPV concepts can be combined with PROV-O to track the
provenance of a right exercising activity instance. This allows for the
representation of provenance details, such as the entities involved in
the activity, i.e., <code>prov:wasAssociatedWith</code>, or the
data/notice generated by the activity, i.e.,
<code>prov:generated</code>.</p>
<h3 id="sec:policies">GDPR-related rights requests as machine-executable
policies</h3>
<p>DPV and ODRL can also be used for data subjects to send GDPR-related
right requests in a machine-interpretable format to data controllers.
Such requests can then be integrated in their rights management
processes for automated execution of responses to data subjects’
requests. For example, systems that use an ODRL evaluator based on the
formal semantics of ODRL <span class="citation"
data-cites="fornara_odrl_2024"><a href="#ref-fornara_odrl_2024"
role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a></span> can assess policies to determine
which ones are active, have been violated, or have been fulfilled, to
respond consistently and interoperably to rights-related requests. As
such, GDPR’s data subject rights described in Articles 15 to 22 can be
instantiated as ODRL policies containing permissions, prohibitions and
obligations to data controllers to act upon or fulfil. Generic policies
for each right are available in the specification.</p>
<h2 id="sec:conclusions">Conclusions and Future Work</h2>
<p>This article provides a machine-interpretable model to represent
information regarding data subject rights, notices to communicate about
them with other entities, records for auditing and policies for
automated execution of responses to rights requests based on the GDPR.
We believe our proposal provides a crucially missing technological piece
that is required to make effective use of GDPR rights across different
services that utilise the Web, in an interoperable manner. DPV, a
central component of our rights management specification, is a
comprehensive and growing resource that is being actively developed, has
been used by industry and academic projects, and involves inputs from a
diverse range of stakeholders. More importantly, the development of this
specification involves engagement with legal experts who validate its
use as per legal requirements<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we highlight the importance of this work in developing
ecosystems based on the Data Governance Act (DGA), Data Act, European
Digital Identity (EUDI) and Data Spaces regulations, where data reuse,
rights and consent management will be based on technical
infrastructures. The work presented in this article provides the
technical basis for creating a GDPR-compliant by design rights
management infrastructure that Data Spaces or EUDI wallets can utilise
for individuals and organisations to exercise and manage rights in a
standardised and interoperable manner. To enable its technical adoption,
we will explore the integration of our work with protocols such as the
Data Rights Protocol or the Advanced Data Protection Control<a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> which have rights management in
their scope but lack the technical implementation – which this work can
provide.</p>
