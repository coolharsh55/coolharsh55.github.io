<p><strong>Abstract</strong> Data Protection and Consenting Communication Mechanisms (DPCCMs) enable users to express their privacy decisions and manage their online consent. Thus, they can become a crucial means of protecting individuals' online privacy and agency, thereby replacing the current problematic practices such as "consent dialogues".
Based on an in-depth analysis of different DPCCMs, we propose an interdisciplinary set of factors that can be used for a comparison of such mechanisms. Moreover, we use the results from a qualitative expert study to identify some of the main multidisciplinary challenges that DPCCMs should address to become widely adopted data privacy mechanisms. We leverage both the factors and the challenges to compare two current <i>open specifications</i>, i.e. the Advanced Data Protection Control (ADPC) and the Global Privacy Control (GPC), and discuss future work. </p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The increasing adoption of online technologies has caused serious
concerns regarding data privacy and users’ agency (see e.g. <span
class="citation" data-cites="smithInformationPrivacyResearch2011"><a
href="#ref-smithInformationPrivacyResearch2011"
role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span>), as they expose both individuals
and societies to several risks: from the implementation of so-called
<em>dark patterns</em> that extort consent to personal data processing
<span class="citation"
data-cites="gray_dark_2021 mathur_dark_2019 nouwens_dark_2020"><a
href="#ref-gray_dark_2021" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a>–<a
href="#ref-nouwens_dark_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span>,
through direct marketing meant to sway political elections <span
class="citation" data-cites="wylie2019mindf"><a
href="#ref-wylie2019mindf" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></span>, to other
forms of online influence that cause the systemic socioeconomic upheaval
of our societies <span class="citation"
data-cites="zuboffAgeSurveillanceCapitalism2019a"><a
href="#ref-zuboffAgeSurveillanceCapitalism2019a"
role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span>. Addressing such concerns to protect
individual and collective rights has caused one of the most challenging
interdisciplinary endeavours of our time. One way to address these
concerns is to consider Human-centric, Accountable, Lawful, and Ethical
(HALE) <span class="citation"
data-cites="humanHALEWHALEFramework2022"><a
href="#ref-humanHALEWHALEFramework2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span> manners to communicate data,
metadata, information, user preferences, or decisions regarding personal
data processing, and assisting end-users to express their privacy
decisions through free and informed consent <span class="citation"
data-cites="humanHumanCentricPerspectiveDigital2021"><a
href="#ref-humanHumanCentricPerspectiveDigital2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></span> implemented by novel sociotechnical
means <span class="citation"
data-cites="humanHumancentricPersonalData2022"><a
href="#ref-humanHumancentricPersonalData2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a></span>. However, the current <em>web-based
data processing mechanisms</em> still lack effective underlying
mechanisms that provide such functionalities. <em>Data Protection and
Consenting Communication Mechanisms</em> (DPCCMs), also known as
<em>privacy automated signals</em> <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, are meant to address
some of these issues, namely the lack of communication mechanisms
between data controllers and data subjects. Historically, <em>privacy
signals</em> were used to refer to some of these mechanisms. However,
considering 1) the intersectionality of data protection consent and
other types of <em>consent</em> <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, and 2) the fact that
such mechanisms can potentially go beyond simple signals (e.g. binary
signals) and become <em>advanced mechanisms using diverse
technologies</em>, we deliberately adopt the term <span>Data Protection
and Consenting Communication Mechanisms</span> (DPCCMs). As it is
evident from their names, DPCCMs are mechanisms that can be used for the
communication of data, metadata, information, preferences, or/and
decisions related to data protection or/and consenting between different
actors. They vary in their approach and ambition, and range from simple
<em>binary signals</em> such as the “Do Not Track”<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
(DNT) and the more recent “Global Privacy Control”<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
(GPC) <span class="citation" data-cites="zimmeck2020standardizing"><a
href="#ref-zimmeck2020standardizing"
role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></span>, to more <em>expressive</em>
mechanisms such as the Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P)<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, the “Advanced Data Protection
Control”<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> (ADPC) <span class="citation"
data-cites="humanAdvancedDataProtection2021 human2022adpc"><a
href="#ref-humanAdvancedDataProtection2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a>, <a href="#ref-human2022adpc"
role="doc-biblioref">[13]</a></span>, and industry-controlled efforts
such as the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
(TCF v2). Earlier attempts, such as DNT and P3P, faced strong
multidimensional barriers to their adoption and a lack of legal
enforcement, which led them to rapidly become obsolete <span
class="citation" data-cites="hils2021privacy"><a
href="#ref-hils2021privacy" role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></span>.
However, DPCCMs have seen a resurgence in recent times (i.e., GPC, ADPC,
TCF), owing to multiple factors: advancements in data protection and
privacy legislation, in particular the European General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA); and
proactive measures taken by large platforms such as Apple’s App Tracking
Transparency (ATT) <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>. Considering the importance of
DPCCMs and the lack of comparative research on current proposals, after
a short presentation of the two main open proposals in Section <a
href="#sec:proposals" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:proposals">2</a> and a description of the
methodology used in Section <a href="#sec:methodology"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:methodology">3</a>, this
paper presents a study investigating four research questions:
(<strong>RQ1</strong>) <em>What are the technical factors that can be
used to characterize and compare DPCCMs?</em> (<strong>RQ2</strong>)
<em>What are the differences between the current open-standard DPCCM
proposals (GPC and ADPC) based on the identified technical factors?</em>
The answers to these first two questions are illustrated in Section <a
href="#sec:techComparison" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:techComparison">4</a>. (<strong>RQ3</strong>)
<em>What are the challenges to realize a Human-centric, Accountable,
Lawful, and Ethical DPCCM?</em> is answered in Section <a
href="#sec:sectionChallenge" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:sectionChallenge">5</a>. Finally, Section <a
href="#sec:discussion" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:discussion">6</a> tackles the last research
question: (<strong>RQ4</strong>) <em>To what extent are the identified
challenges addressed in the current GPC and ADPC proposals?</em>
Section <a href="#sec:conclusion" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:conclusion">7</a> concludes the work.</p>
<h2 id="sec:proposals">Current Proposals: GPC and ADPC</h2>
<p>We focus on GPC and ADPC, since the other proposals (e.g., TCF and
ATT) are: (i) not open specifications that can be implemented by anyone;
(ii) strictly regulated within a limited context (e.g. use by
companies); or (iii) in the case of TCF, arguably insufficient to meet
legal requirements by design <span class="citation"
data-cites="APD2022"><a href="#ref-APD2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[15]</a></span>.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="global-privacy-control-gpc"><strong>Global
Privacy Control (GPC)</strong></h4>
<p>GPC is a unary signal similar to DNT. Whereas DNT specifies binary
values to permit or prohibit [third-party] tracking, GPC has a single
state expressing “Do Not Sell”. Like DNT, GPC is communicated by the
user-agent through HTTP headers or DOM, and is enforceable as a
“user-enabled global privacy control” under the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA 999.315). As of January 2022, GPC has been implemented
by several actors, such as web-browsers (e.g., Brave, DuckDuckGo,
Firefox) and popular websites (e.g., New York Times, Washington Post),
with support expressed by Consent Management Providers (CMP) like
OneTrust and TrustArc. The GPC specification might have potential
application to other jurisdictions, e.g. to be employed to “limit the
sale or sharing” of personal data based on GDPR’s Article 7 (Conditions
for consent) and Article 21 (Right to object). However, this is a matter
of further investigation and discussions, as the GPC is not specifically
designed to correspond to EU regulations and any correlations made to
the GDPR are explicitly mentioned in the GPC text as experimental.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered"
id="advanced-data-protection-control-adpc"><strong>Advanced Data
Protection Control (ADPC)</strong></h4>
<p>ADPC, similar to P3P, is a bidirectional communication mechanism that
can be initiated by either websites or users. It can express multiple
distinct values regarding the purposes for which consent is given or
withheld, and can object to direct marketing and legitimate interest.
ADPC can be communicated using HTTP headers, DOM, or a JavaScript API.
It was developed as part of the RESPECTED project, <a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> led
by Soheil Human (Sustainable Computing Lab of the Vienna University of
Economics and Business) and Max Schrems (NOYB – European Center for
Digital Rights). <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> ADPC specifies its intended
application for the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights’ Article 8 (and
Article 3), GDPR’s Recital 32 and Article 7, Article 21, and ePrivacy
Directive’s Recital 32 (Use of user-agent), and may be used as an
automated communication mechanism under the proposed ePrivacy
Regulation <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="sec:methodology"> Methodology</h2>
<p>To answer our research questions, we first reviewed and analysed the
technical specifications and documents related to P3P, DNT, GPC, ADPC,
TCF, NAI <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>, GAID <a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>,
and ATT. Based on this document analysis, a technical comparison of
factors (reported in Section <a href="#sec:techComparison"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:techComparison">4</a>) was
performed (<strong>RQ1</strong>). While such factors can contribute to
describe and compare different types of DPCCMs in the future, here we
used them to compare GPC and ADPC (<strong>RQ2</strong>). We then
carried out online multimodal semi-structured focus groups. These
groups, comprised of the co-authors of this paper, included eight
privacy experts (with gender balance) working at seven different
academic institutions: three computer scientists (one web privacy
expert, one IoT privacy expert, one data security expert), two privacy
HCI experts, two lawyers (experts in data protection), and one expert in
privacy standards, besides the moderator with a background in cognitive
science, information systems, and sociology of technology. The focus
groups iterated along several three hours sessions, where the
participants simultaneously worked on an online whiteboard and joined an
online call, thereby providing multimodal (textual, visual and verbal)
inputs. The data was analysed based on a grounded theory approach <span
class="citation" data-cites="charmaz2014constructing"><a
href="#ref-charmaz2014constructing"
role="doc-biblioref">[16]</a></span>, with three rounds of coding, and
the experts validated the reported results regarding the main challenges
that DPCCMs entail (<strong>RQ3</strong>, reported in Section <a
href="#sec:sectionChallenge" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:sectionChallenge">5</a> and <strong>RQ4</strong>,
reported in Section <a href="#sec:discussion" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:discussion">6</a>).</p>
<h2 id="sec:techComparison">Technical Comparison of GPC &amp; ADPC</h2>
<p>The technical factors of GPC and ADPC are presented in Table <a
href="#tab:comparison" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:comparison">[tab:comparison]</a> and classified into
1) the content of the signals, 2) their possible interpretation, 3)
their means of communication, and 4) the contextual factors.</p>
<h3 id="signal-contents">Signal Contents</h3>
<h4 id="sec:captured_intent">Captured Intent</h4>
<p>This relates to the <em>intent</em> or <em>action</em> of the user
that the signal represents and conveys in terms of permissions and
prohibitions. For example, it can specify and communicate the user’s
intention to opt-in or opt-out. Both GPC (for <em>sale of data</em>) and
ADPC (for <em>indicated purposes</em>) support opt-out intentions by
declaring prohibitions, while ADPC also supports opt-in (for indicated
purposes).</p>
<h4 id="sec:expandability_of_signal">Extensibility</h4>
<p>This refers to the ability of adding and/or changing information in
the signal’s communication while adhering to its specification. It is
meant to extend its use to additional values, use-cases, or contexts
other than those it was developed for. GPC does not define mechanisms
through which it can be extended, while ADPC does, as it allows an
implementation to define or use its own values and vocabularies.</p>
<h4 id="sub:granularity_of_signal_s_application">Granularity</h4>
<p>This represents the scope or limitation of the signal’s applicability
in terms of actors or context. Both GPC and ADPC do not explicitly
define actors in their communication, nor provide the ability to specify
the agents involved in the signal communication. Thus, both can have a
‘global’ scope, i.e., they can be expressed uniformly, e.g. at a browser
level for all websites where the signal is set and for all actors. Both
can also support a ‘local’ scope, whereby they can be independently
expressed in specific contexts or for specific websites. It is worth
mentioning that since ADPC supports the communication of free texts,
contexts and actors can be specified as a part of the text. However,
this is not explicitly described in the current proposal.</p>
<h4 id="sec:format">Format and Values</h4>
<p>The <em>values</em> in a signal are distinct pieces of information
related to the interpretation of the signal’s intended information. The
<em>format</em> is the ‘shape’ or ‘structure’ in which values are
represented. Both <em>values</em> and <em>formats</em> have an impact on
the effort required to interpret the signal and on the ‘complexity’ of
the information that can be communicated. Both serve to determine the
suitable ‘vocabulary’ and ‘interfaces’ that must be provided to the user
for decision-making, expression and management. GPC is a unary signal,
i.e., its values are limited to a single state (SET), therefore their
interpretation is straightforward. ADPC does not specify a strict
structure, but is akin to the expression of a ‘policy’ consisting of
fields related to consent and objection to legitimate interests. ADPC
does not provide a vocabulary or a structure for the development of
vocabularies about the values expressed in its fields.</p>
<h3 id="signal-interpretation">Signal Interpretation</h3>
<h4 id="sec:default_values_of_signal">Interpretation of Absence</h4>
<p>The <em>absence</em> of a signal refers to a situation where no
signal is communicated and its implications. Neither GPC nor ADPC define
the interpretation of their absence. While this is not a necessity, it
is important to consider, since a lack of signal may influence what
controllers interpret as a permission (opt-out) or prohibition
(opt-in).</p>
<h4 id="sec:feedback_of_signal_expression">Feedback of Signal
Expression</h4>
<p><em>Feedback</em> refers to the response sent by the recipient of the
signal based on the signal’s values. The feedback can be an
acknowledgement of the communication of the signal itself, or specific
to a contextual event, such as a change in the signal’s state or values.
Neither GPC nor ADPC define a mechanism for feedback. For clarity, we
split this factor into <em>feedback of expression</em> and <em>on
change</em> in the summary table.</p>
<h3 id="signal-communication">Signal Communication</h3>
<h4 id="sec:expression_of_signal_values">Medium of Expression</h4>
<p>The <em>medium of expression</em> refers to the specific mechanism
through which the signal’s information is communicated from the sender
to the recipient. GPC and ADPC convey values through HTTP headers or DOM
elements, with ADPC also supporting communication through
JavaScript.</p>
<h4 id="sec:signal_recipient">Recipient and Sender</h4>
<p>These entities are considered as factors to identify the disparity
between who <em>provides</em> the ability to express the signal and set
its values and who receives that value. For GPC, the signal is expressed
by the user-agent and received by the controller (or whoever is
operating the servers). Based on its design, ADPC features both users
and controllers as recipients of the signal expressed by websites and
user-agents respectively, as it allows policies to be communicated
between the two.</p>
<h4 id="propagation-of-signal">Propagation of Signal</h4>
<p>The signal must be shared with all the actors involved in data flows
to accurately convey its intention. Neither GPC nor ADPC address how it
should be propagated to other actors where the communication does not
directly occur between the party and the user.</p>
<h3 id="contextual-factors">Contextual factors</h3>
<h4 id="sec:developer_of_signal">Developer and Maintainer</h4>
<p>The developer signifies the entities or communities that affect the
development, interpretation, and deployment of the signal, and allows
discovering the stakeholders involved. GPC and ADPC were developed
through small closed initiatives. As described in Section <a
href="#sec:proposals" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:proposals">2</a>, GPC’s creation involved US-based
browser vendors, publishers, companies in the privacy sector, and
academics. ADPC’s development involved academics and an NGO in the
Austrian RESPECTeD research project.</p>
<h4 id="sec:fingerprinting_risks_from_using_signal">Fingerprinting
Risks</h4>
<p>By providing additional surfaces for tracking and profiling, unique
combination of signal values present a “fingerprinting risk”. The more
values a signal expresses, the greater the risk. GPC represents minor
risks given its binary states (that is: SET, NOT PRESENT), whereas ADPC
does not present restrictions on the values or vocabularies used and
thereby leads to a large surface for fingerprinting.</p>
<h4 id="sec:enforceability_of_signal">Enforcement and
Enforceability</h4>
<p>This refers to the defined interpretation and enforcement of a
signal’s value <em>by design and by definition</em>, but differs from
legal enforcement based on the interpretation of the actions, values,
and context of a signal with respect to the fulfilment (or violation) of
legal obligations in data protection legislation (such as the GDPR).
Both GPC and ADPC refer to specific legal obligations in their
specifications, with GPC being enforceable under the CCPA. Both GPC and
ADPC express potential for application under the GDPR (consent provision
and withdrawal, respectively in Recital 32, Article 4(11), Article
6(1)(a) and Article 7; right to object in Article 21) and the ePrivacy
Directive.</p>
<h4 id="sec:loopholes_in_signal_interpretation">Loopholes in
Interpretation</h4>
<p>This factor considers if there are known <em>loopholes</em> in the
interpretation of the signal — that we define as any condition or event
preventing the correct interpretation of a signal’s values. An example
is that none of the signals specify how conflicts with other values or
signals should be addressed <span class="citation"
data-cites="hils2021privacy"><a href="#ref-hils2021privacy"
role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></span>. GPC and ADPC do not clarify how to
interpret which signal takes precedence when conflicting interpretations
are possible through differences between the signal’s communication and
the user’s actions (e.g. a mismatch when a user expresses a permission
through a consent dialogue while the signal communicates a
prohibition).</p>
<h4 id="application-of-signal">Application of Signal</h4>
<p>This represents the specific activity or action the signal aims to
change or regulate.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Most of the existing signals relate
to tracking, surveillance, and permission to share data in some way. GPC
is meant to prohibit “selling” (as defined by CCPA) or sharing of
personal data with “any party other than the one the person intends to
interact with”. ADPC serves to provide or withdraw consent and object to
direct marketing or use of legitimate interests (regardless of who the
user interacts with). This factor is split into three lines in the
summary table for the sake of clarity.</p>
<h4 id="sec:stability_of_signal_s_specification">Stability and Technical
Standardization</h4>
<p>The <em>stability</em> of a signal represents the potential for
change in interpretation, implementation, or methods. GPC can be
considered as being stable (as it is implemented by browsers and
respected by some service providers), although it is not standardized
yet (e.g. by W3C or other standardization organizations). ADPC is a
proposed specification that currently lacks extensive adoption and —
similar to GPC — is not yet technically standardized by standardization
organizations.</p>
<h4 id="sec:transparency_of_signal_s_implementation">Auditability</h4>
<p>This relates to the possibility to investigate the expression of the
signal’s value and whether and how it is acknowledged and respected. GPC
and ADPC are simple to investigate, as one only needs to capture and
inspect the HTTP communications between user-agent and servers.</p>
<h4 id="adoptability">Adoptability</h4>
<p>This factor concerns whether the signal can be adopted by
stakeholders other than those that developed the signal and the use in
different use-cases and domains. GPC and ADPC can be expressed by any
user-agent or actor on any device or platform. To date, GPC has been
adopted by some browsers (e.g., Firefox, Brave, DDG) and some website /
service providers (e.g., DDG, NYT, etc.)</p>
<h4 id="agency">Agency</h4>
<p>This refers to the actor on whose behalf the signal is acting.
Although it can be argued that all privacy signals are based on the
<em>agency of the user</em>, an alternative perspective considers who
controls the signal and its expression. GPC and ADPC represent the
agency of the user in communicating intent, while ADPC also represents
the agency of the controller in making requests to the user.</p>

<h2 id="sec:sectionChallenge">Current Personal Data Protection and

<p>Based on the results of our expert study, the following challenges to
DPCCMs (summarized in Table <a href="#table:challenges"

selected: i) human centricity and HCI, ii) accountability, auditability

<h3 id="subsec:human">Human-centric and HCI Challenges</h3>
<p>A shift of both decision-making power and structure from data

centre of data protection mechanisms.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="h-1-imbalance-of-power">H-1: Imbalance of

<p>Currently, the data controller decides the purposes and means of data

<h4 class="unnumbered" id="h-2-respect-user-constraints">H-2: Respect

<p>The upsurge of the way in which current consent dialogues are

<h4 class="unnumbered"

<p>It has been shown that cookies and risks associated with them are
generally poorly understood by web users <span class="citation"
data-cites="ha2006examination"><a href="#ref-ha2006examination"
role="doc-biblioref">[19]</a></span>. Moreover, language in consent
requests can be complex, incomplete, vague and misleading <span
class="citation" data-cites="Santos2021"><a href="#ref-Santos2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[20]</a></span>. How to provide complete
information about data processing practices, while being concise and
direct, is an open question. In this regard, Kulyk et al.  <span
class="citation" data-cites="kulykThisWebsiteUses2018a"><a

role="doc-biblioref">[21]</a></span> found that users appreciated tools

of consent to their privacy. Later research by Elbert et al. <span

indicates how well-designed consent notices can improve understanding of
privacy practices by highlighting important features.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="h-4-enforce-good-practices">H-4: Enforce Good

<p>Utz et al. showed that design patterns can be used to increase
consent rates <span class="citation" data-cites="utz_informed_2019"><a
href="#ref-utz_informed_2019" role="doc-biblioref">[23]</a></span>, a
practice now known as “consent optimization”. Service providers and
consent managers make use of “dark patterns” to manipulate users into
consenting <span class="citation" data-cites="nouwens_dark_2020"><a
href="#ref-nouwens_dark_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span>. When
used to nudge users towards privacy-invasive settings and unduly steer
consent decisions, manipulative designs have ethical and, in most cases,
a legal import  <span class="citation" data-cites="gray_dark_2021"><a
href="#ref-gray_dark_2021" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span>. In this
regard, the EU Parliament recently voted on the proposed Digital
Services Act <a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> to include a “ban on dark patterns”
relating to consent and to offer options based on “tracking-free
advertising” in case consent is refused or withdrawn to avoid coercion
via tracking walls.</p>
<h3 id="subsec:accountability">Accountability, Auditability and
Transparency Challenges</h3>
<p>Accountability refers to the property of a system that allows its
inspection, monitoring and measurement from the outside. It can also be
connected to transparency, user empowerment <span class="citation"
data-cites="humanEnduserEmpowermentInterdisciplinary2020"><a
href="#ref-humanEnduserEmpowermentInterdisciplinary2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[24]</a></span> and control over their personal
data.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered"
id="a-1-accountability-artefacts-and-repudiation">A-1: Accountability
Artefacts and Repudiation</h4>
<p>An ideal consenting system should be able to produce authentic
artefacts, such as records of processing activities, that can support
its inspection, both by watchdogs during an investigation and by the
individuals themselves. Such artefacts must be sufficient, complete and
available at any point in time. Note that a simple threat to any consent
model is that a data controller can claim <em>plausible deniability</em>
by claiming that either the signal was not received or that an external
process manufactured it outside of the user’s direct control. While it
adds algorithmic complexity, accountability can be achieved at no cost
to the user experience <span class="citation"
data-cites="jesusharsh2022"><a href="#ref-jesusharsh2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[25]</a></span>. DPCCMs that only generate binary
signals do not, on their own, meet sufficient accountability
requirements. Accountability is best observed when confronted with a
threat model, where the risks to privacy or compliance are identified
and modelled <span class="citation" data-cites="jesus2020towards"><a
href="#ref-jesus2020towards" role="doc-biblioref">[26]</a></span>. The
key limitation is the lack of interactivity and the notion of
<em>session</em>, i.e., the fact that simple DPCCMs are uni-directional
rather than based on long-lived user identifiers or stored states. This
stems from the fact that accountability requires data authenticity
which, in turn, relies on essential secure exchange/negotiation of data
(e.g., to prove a claim such as "I Consent to the stated conditions")
and, thus, requires bidirectionally. Two forms of authenticity exist: 1)
direct/peer-to-peer negotiation or 2) engagement of a jointly trusted
third party to notarise claims.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered"
id="a-2-post-consent-access-to-information-and-decisions">A-2:
Post-Consent access to information and decisions</h4>
<p>The expression of one’s own privacy preferences is cumbersome, thus
new interfacing mechanisms such as self-service privacy dashboards <span
class="citation" data-cites="bier2016"><a href="#ref-bier2016"
role="doc-biblioref">[27]</a></span> are needed. Post-consent access is
a further challenge, as users’ preferences may change over time. Thus
single actions should not be definite, irrevocable, and with
long-lasting effects <span class="citation"
data-cites="jesus-sfte-2021"><a href="#ref-jesus-sfte-2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[28]</a></span> and consent should not be modelled

role="doc-biblioref">[30]</a></span>.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="a-3-proof-of-identity">A-3: Proof of
Identity</h4>
<p>Any signal needs to consider the consent life cycle, which entails
that users can (or should be able to) modify their original decisions
and exercise their rights, e.g., to erasure and of access. These actions
require the ability to verify the identity associated with a request
 <span class="citation" data-cites="boniface2019security"><a
href="#ref-boniface2019security" role="doc-biblioref">[31]</a></span> to
protect against attacks such as modification or illegitimate access.</p>
<h3 id="subsec:legal">Legal Challenges</h3>
<p>Current legislation, such as the GDPR, the ePrivacy Directive, and
the CCPA, provides the regulatory framework to which DPCCMs must abide.
However, the practical implementation of the legal principles and rules
often proves to be extremely challenging <span class="citation"
data-cites="Santos_Bielova_Matte_2020"><a
href="#ref-Santos_Bielova_Matte_2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[32]</a></span>.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered"
id="l-1-user-preferences-containing-personal-data">L-1: User preferences
containing personal data</h4>
<p>Whenever a DPCCM enables users to express their preferences, it might
process personal data, such as a user’s IP address <span
class="citation" data-cites="Santos2021ConsentMP"><a
href="#ref-Santos2021ConsentMP" role="doc-biblioref">[33]</a></span> or
another online unique identifier which requires compliance with data
protection obligations, including the integrity and security of the
signal (GDPR, Article 5(1)(f)), and an appropriate legal basis. In
addition, DPCCMs might need user identifiers, such as IP addresses, to
ensure continued application. When combined with unique personal
identifiers and information from other sources, these online identifiers
increase the risks of identifiability even when a user has not expressed
her consent to any kind of personal data collection, triggering personal
data breach (Articles 4(12), 5(1)(f), 32 GDPR). For example, a recent
decision by the Belgian Data Protection Authority (APD) highlights some
of the most pressing legal challenges that DPCCMs currently face. This
decision <span class="citation" data-cites="belgian_tcf"><a
href="#ref-belgian_tcf" role="doc-biblioref">[34]</a></span> holds that
the Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe’s Transparency &amp; Consent
Framework (IAB TCF), a consent industry standard, failed to establish a
legal basis for the processing of consent signal strings, and that the
legal bases offered by the TCF were inadequate.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="l-2-legal-requirements">L-2: Legal
requirements</h4>
<p>Under the CCPA, users are entitled to concrete substantive rights, as
follows. 1) The right to opt-out of sale: websites are required to
provide “<em>a clear and conspicuous link</em>” on the homepage of their
website entitled “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” or “Don’t Sell My
Personal Info” that allows users to invoke their right to opt-out of
sale of their personal information (sections 1798.120, 1798.135). 2) The
right to receive information, upon request, on the categories of
personal information to be collected and right to be informed of the
purposes for which such data shall be used. This information should
enable a “meaningful understanding” (section 1798.100). 3) The right to
delete personal information about the consumer that a website has
collected (section 1798.105). Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive and
Articles 4(11) and 7 of the GDPR require that consent is freely given,
prior, informed, specific, unambiguous, readable, accessible, and
revocable. Moreover, the GDPR requires any consent management platform,
acting as a data controller, to offer transparent information to users,
as listed in Articles 13 and 14 (purposes, recipients, rights, storage,
legal basis, etc.) to enable users to adequately consider the options
before taking a decision. However, neither the GDPR -nor the EDPB in its
guidance- provide methods or means to verify compliance: it does not
indicate the procedures to guide the operationalization or enforcement
of its principles, nor provides guidelines to perform systematic audits.
Due to the large amount of information involved, compliance with these
requirements is very complex from a technical (and HCI) perspective.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="l-3-information-overload">L-3: Information
overload</h4>
<p>Users can’t realistically read all the privacy notices of the online
services they interact with. Bravo-Lillo et al. <span class="citation"
data-cites="bravo2014harder"><a href="#ref-bravo2014harder"
role="doc-biblioref">[35]</a></span> call this phenomenon “pop-up
fatigue” or “habituation” to describe the tendency to ignore relevant
information in circumstances where users are repeatedly confronted with
it, such as consent dialogues and privacy policies. Thus, the strict
implementation of the above regulations is almost futile if consent
dialogues are doomed to be ignored. This questions whether the
implementation of the current consent and information requirements is
legally valid  <span class="citation"
data-cites="lindegren2021evaluation"><a
href="#ref-lindegren2021evaluation"
role="doc-biblioref">[36]</a></span>.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="l-4-standardization">L-4:
Standardization</h4>
<p>Past experiences showed that working with non-interoperable and
misaligned requirements and signals  <span class="citation"
data-cites="MelicherSharifTanBauerChristodorescuLeon+2015+135+154"><a
href="#ref-MelicherSharifTanBauerChristodorescuLeon+2015+135+154"
role="doc-biblioref">[37]</a></span> may undermine the very purpose of
such protocols to effectively communicate the data processing
preferences and decisions of users. Thus, standardisation offers
guarantees that bad faith website providers cannot hide behind
non-interoperability claims to reject Internet users’ signals  <span
class="citation" data-cites="Kamara"><a href="#ref-Kamara"
role="doc-biblioref">[38]</a></span>. Nevertheless, there is a
multiplicity of competing standardisation endeavours – what has been
commonly called as a ‘jungle of standards’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="Gleeson2014ItsAJ"><a href="#ref-Gleeson2014ItsAJ"
role="doc-biblioref">[39]</a></span> in the field of data protection. A
study conducted for the European Cybersecurity Agency, ENISA, showed
there is a need for a structured approach on how privacy related
standards are selected, agreed upon, and prioritised  <span
class="citation" data-cites="ENISAstandard"><a href="#ref-ENISAstandard"
role="doc-biblioref">[40]</a></span>. Currently, the selection of a
suitable standard or specification lies mostly at the discretion of the
website provider or vendor, since there is no legal or other obligation
to conform to a specific DPCCMs. Moreover, the voluntary nature of
technical standards and specifications  <span class="citation"
data-cites="Harcourt"><a href="#ref-Harcourt"
role="doc-biblioref">[41]</a></span> leads to a <em>lack of vertical
enforceability</em> thereof. While in the US for example, standards of
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are mandatory
for federal agencies and their contractors, technical standards and
specifications in the EU are, in principle, not mandatory. As a result,
even when a website provider undertakes to apply and conform to a
certain DPCCM protocol, there is no direct administrative or other
penalty for not respecting the signal received in line with the
Communication Protocol, if website providers demonstrate they comply in
other ways with the applicable data protection law. Standardisation
efforts are often the result of compromise of negotiations among
entities participating in technical standardisation committees.
“Political, economic, and social effects can be hard coded into protocol
designs.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Kiernan2021StandardizingSS"><a
href="#ref-Kiernan2021StandardizingSS"
role="doc-biblioref">[42]</a></span>. The importance of ensuring good
governance of standardisation bodies was also recently highlighted by
the European Commission (2022) <span class="citation"
data-cites="EUCOM2022"><a href="#ref-EUCOM2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[43]</a></span>, which pointed at integrity,
inclusiveness and accessibility of European Standardisation
Organisations. Especially the standardisation of DPCCM Protocols should
respect those principles, considering the possible impact of those
protocols on fundamental rights of the right to protection of personal
data, and other freedoms, such as the freedom of expression and human
dignity <span class="citation" data-cites="hert"><a href="#ref-hert"
role="doc-biblioref">[44]</a></span>.</p>
<h3 id="subsec:techno">Technical challenges</h3>
<p>Technological diversity raises numerous challenges, as the technical
settings for data protection and consent management can be as diverse as
the contexts in which data collection happens (e.g., on the Web or in
physical environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT)). DPCCMs must
therefore account for the diversity of different technological setups,
as they can be difficult to implement in IoT environments due to the
lack of appropriate interfaces of devices, their <em>passivity</em>, and
their low computational power.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="t-1-technological-variety">T-1: Technological
variety</h4>
<p>Domain and application-specific solutions might be helpful in the
short term, but might soon fail to deal with the complexity of
protecting humans’ privacy and agency throughout the whole system of
interconnected processes, while keeping the system well functioning and
sustainable. For example, the IoT is made of various protocols and types
of technologies, thus generic solutions need to be carefully devised in
order to encompass such variety <span class="citation"
data-cites="morel2019generic"><a href="#ref-morel2019generic"
role="doc-biblioref">[45]</a></span>. Even if the IoT is by far the more
diverse environment, variety can also be found on the Web. For instance,
the Web can be navigated through different browsers on different types
of machines with different operating systems, impacting how DPCCMs can
be implemented.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="t-2-specificities-of-environments">T-2:
Specificities of environments</h4>
<p>Existing DPCCMs on the web use JavaScript or HTTP, but the IoT
technological stack is quite different. For example, individuals are
more prone to be physically tracked through their smartphones in the
IoT <span class="citation"
data-cites="demirAnalysingPrivacyPolicies2014"><a
href="#ref-demirAnalysingPrivacyPolicies2014"
role="doc-biblioref">[46]</a></span>, most of the time unbeknownst to
them. Accordingly, consent management needs to be more adequately
implemented using appropriate technological stacks in different
environments <span class="citation"
data-cites="cunche2020colot giordanoUPRISEIoTUsercentricPrivacy2019"><a
href="#ref-cunche2020colot" role="doc-biblioref">[47]</a>, <a
href="#ref-giordanoUPRISEIoTUsercentricPrivacy2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[48]</a></span>. In addition, IoT devices are often
devoid of proper interfaces to convey information, which in the
worst-case results in individuals being tracked without being aware of
it. Moreover, some devices are unable to actively communicate due to
their limited computational power. These limitations must be taken into
account when designing DPCCMs, otherwise large parts of the
technological landscape will be unable to account for privacy
signals.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="t-3-contents-of-information">T-3: Contents of
information</h4>
<p>The DPCCM’s contents refer to the ‘language’ used to communicate a
decision. While this typically includes interpretation of a particular
value or symbol, it also includes defining interpretation when a value
is missing or not conveyed. The content of the information communicated
reflects the expressiveness of DPCCMs. While simple DPCCMs are easy to
parse and understand, and therefore tend to have homogeneous
interpretations and applications, complex DPCCMS are comparatively more
difficult to utilise, although they offer richer information to
convey.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="t-4-communication-of-information">T-4:
Communication of information</h4>
<p>A DPCCM should express and communicate information related to the
preferences, decisions, or policies between service providers and users.
Simple signals can be expressed using minimal data and can thus be
transmitted frequently, whereas complex information requires either 1) a
summarised or alternative representation or 2) an alternative model
where it is expressed selectively (e.g. on first visit). An important
part of the communication is the acknowledgement of the decision, both
from data subjects and from controllers. When a DPCCM communicates an
intention or a decision, the capability of the same signal or protocol
to receive acknowledgement from the other party or agent is important to
understand whether: (i) it supports the DPCCM; (ii) it has understood
and acknowledged the decision; and (iii) there is any further relevant
communication.</p>

<h2 id="sec:discussion">Comparison and Discussion</h2>
<p>The primary value of both GPC and ADPC specifications is that they
provide a substitute for communication of end-user decisions besides —
or as a replacement of — current consent mechanisms (e.g. consent
dialogues). However, both proposals do not address Section <a
href="#sec:sectionChallenge" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:sectionChallenge">5</a>’s challenges in the same
way.</p>
<p><strong>Human-centric challenges:</strong> Both GPC and ADPC can
contribute towards a shift from an imbalance of power to user-centric
practices (<strong>H-1</strong>), but in different contexts, ways and
levels (see Section <a href="#sec:techComparison"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:techComparison">4</a> for
technical details). Because GPC’s validity under the GDPR is still an
unclear matter, a signal with a single application or value might be
applicable only to specific domains and conditions and do not satisfy
the requirement to communicate other user preferences and decisions
(<strong>L-2</strong>). Therefore, websites would still have the
necessity to use <em>consent dialogues</em>, thus leaving the existing
human-centric challenges unresolved (see <strong>H-2</strong>,
<strong>H-3</strong>, <strong>H-4</strong>).</p>
<p>ADPC features the communication of the processing purpose, along with
a textual human-readable description that can be used to provide
relevant information, typically provided through <em>consent
dialogues</em>, such as that required by GDPR’s Article 13. This
information can then be used to generate and present dialogues to the
users by their user-agents (e.g. browsers). If ADPC is made legally
mandatory for websites to implement and support, and hence, for websites
to not show consent dialogues, it would need: i) an implementation on
user-side with sufficient information and ability for the user to
understand and make decisions; ii) similarity between the purposes and
decisions communicated by ADPC and the ones that are shown in a consent
dialogue; or iii) the website’s integration of the ADPC’s expressed
preferences and decisions in its consent dialogue to offer users a
meaningful option. Without such legally mandated requirements, ADPC
would need proactive willingness from websites to be supported and
effective in resolving known issues — which has been historically shown
to be unrealistic (see the case of DNT). GPC can fulfil
<strong>H-2</strong> more easily due to its unary signal, since it only
communicates a single value — which requires a simple interface capable
of binary states (e.g. set/unset checkbox). If ADPC is similarly used as
a single-value fixed-vocabulary signal, it can be expressed by users
using simpler interfaces (e.g. checkboxes or dropdowns). However, if
ADPC does not utilise a fixed or controlled vocabulary and each website
can potentially include new information communicated through ADPC, then
this necessitates the use of additional mechanisms by which the website
and user agree on what the communicated information implies (see
<strong>H-2</strong>). This can be achieved by resorting to a controlled
or standardised vocabulary with agreed-upon semantics and
interpretations (e.g. the controlled vocabulary for purposes in TCF or
the semantically matched concepts in the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV)
<span class="citation" data-cites="panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"><a
href="#ref-panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[49]</a></span>). Since GPC does not support
communicating additional information, <strong>H-3</strong> and
<strong>H-4</strong> are not directly relevant to its implementation.
However, these challenges are important for ADPC where a large
vocabulary is used, requiring additional tools and interfaces to allow
the user to express a decision <em>dynamically</em> or
<em>contextually</em>. These tools could be part of existing interfaces
generated by user-agents (e.g. browsers), such as dialogues requesting
permissions or dashboards for management, representation, and
visualization of preferences and decisions i.e. <strong>H-2</strong>,
<strong>H-3</strong>, and <strong>H-4</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability challenges:</strong> None of the
specifications expect a confirmation such as an acknowledgement from the
data controller, i.e., an accountability artifact
(<strong>A-1</strong>). However, user-agents can keep a copy of the
decisions sent. For the GPC unary signal, this information consists only
of its expression to a website. For ADPC, a record of the received
requests and decisions made by users can be stored to change or withdraw
consent and objections — thereby addressing challenges
<strong>A-2</strong> and <strong>A-3</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Legal challenges.</strong> The legal enforcement to which
each signal refers to will directly impact the requirements
(<strong>L-2</strong>) and communication of consent-related information
(<strong>L-3</strong>) for the selected specifications, since both the
GPC and ADPC propose application under the GDPR, with GPC being only
enforceable under CCPA. <strong>L-2</strong> and <strong>L-3</strong>
are relevant for both signals, as information is required to be provided
to users besides the existence of that signal’s application. ADPC
requires providing users with granular information and support <span
class="citation" data-cites="humanHumancentricPersonalData2022"><a
href="#ref-humanHumancentricPersonalData2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a></span> to fulfil both human-centric
(<strong>H-2</strong>, <strong>H-3</strong>, <strong>H-4</strong>) and
legal (<strong>L-2</strong>, <strong>L-3</strong>) requirements.
<strong>L-1</strong> remains a challenge for both signals. Regarding
<strong>L-4</strong>, a thorough study is necessary to explore how both
standardization efforts correspond to good governance principles
required by the EU regulations. Venues to identify complementarity of
initiatives, such as the one studied in this paper, might be a necessary
step to combat the proliferation of standards and specifications. The
current ePrivacy Regulation proposal – facing trialogue negotiations, is
yet to define relevant aspects of automated privacy signals. For
example, whether browsers, and other software placed on the market
permitting electronic communications (such as automatic privacy signals)
will be set to prevent tracking individuals’ digital footsteps by
default.</p>
<p><strong>Technical challenges.</strong> <strong>T-1</strong> and
<strong>T-2</strong> are both yet unsolved challenges for GPC and ADPC:
both are communicated through HTTP headers and DOM elements, with ADPC
additionally supporting programmatic invocation through JavaScript.
Neither is inherently capable of supporting alternate environments (e.g.
IoT, smartphones). This indicates the need for further developing
extensions or additional protocols for their expression.
<strong>T-3</strong> is not applicable for GPC, since it uses only a
single-value communication of users’ preferences. ADPC only specifies a
structure for how information should be communicated, but requires
additional vocabularies that must be supported by both websites and
user(-agents) so as to agree on the contents and interpretation of
information. As for <strong>T-4</strong>, a website operating under CCPA
must support GPC as a legally-enforceable signal. Outside of this
jurisdiction, however, both GPC and ADPC face challenges in fulfilling
the three acknowledgment requirements regarding <strong>T-4</strong> in
terms of whether they support the signal, acknowledge its communication,
and provide feedback in return.</p>
<h2 id="sec:conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this paper we compared two current <em>open specification</em>
DPCCM proposals, i.e the Global Privacy Control (GPC) and the Advanced
Data Protection Control (ADPC), according to the identified technical
factors and some interdisciplinary challenges. We argued that tackling
those requires further research and development to support the
implementation of DPCCMs. More specifically, this paper identified
critical requirements in terms of human-centricity, accountability,
lawfulness, and technicality of a signal and its implementation, thereby
providing a framework through which future developments can be analysed
and discussed.</p>
