<div id="abstract"><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Solid is a new radical paradigm based on decentralising control of data from central organisations to individuals that seeks to empower individuals to have active control of who and how their data is being used. In order to realise this vision, the use-cases and implementations of Solid also require to be consistent with the relevant privacy and data protection regulations such as the GDPR. However, to do so first requires prior understanding of all actors, roles, and processes involved in a use-case, which then need to be aligned with GDPR's concepts to identify relevant obligations, and then investigate their compliance. To assist with this process, we describe Solid as a variation of `cloud technology' and and adapt the existing standardised terminologies and paradigms from ISO/IEC standards. We then investigate the applicability of GDPR's requirements to Solid-based implementations, along with an exploration of how existing issues arising from GDPR enforcement also apply to Solid. Finally, we outline the path forward through specific extensions to Solid's specifications that mitigates known issues and enables the realisation of its benefits.</p>

<h2 id="sec:introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Solid<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> is an ongoing effort to decentralise
the control of data by moving its storage away from centralised systems
and into <em>Pods</em> that are controlled by individuals <span
class="citation" data-cites="mansourDemonstrationSolidPlatform2016"><a
href="#ref-mansourDemonstrationSolidPlatform2016"
role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span>. The Solid specifications <span
class="citation" data-cites="SolidTechnicalReports"><a
href="#ref-SolidTechnicalReports" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span>
define the implementation of Pods as an architecture containing identity
management, access control, and communication. . By controlling access
to their data within Pods, individuals also gain the ability to (re-)use
it elsewhere for competing services or for other features – which not
possible through conventional methods where data is locked and
controlled by service providers.</p>
<p>Solid was initiated in 2016 and is led by WWW-inventor Tim
Berners-Lee <span class="citation"
data-cites="mansourDemonstrationSolidPlatform2016"><a
href="#ref-mansourDemonstrationSolidPlatform2016"
role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span>. It has gained interest due to its
radical approach to move away from centralisation lock-ins and privacy.
Solid represents a realisation of the data sovereignty philosophy where
individuals ‘control’ their data and how it is used. Since this involves
use of personal data, the existing laws regarding data, privacy, and
data protection, such as EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
<span class="citation" data-cites="Regulation_GDPR"><a
href="#ref-Regulation_GDPR" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span> also
apply to Solid. However, the radical deviation of Solid’s
implementations from conventional methods where data is collected and
centrally retained by companies has resulted in uncertainty regarding
how laws such as GDPR should be interpreted in light of the new
use-cases, specifically regarding their sufficiency and potential for
non-beneficial implications <span class="citation"
data-cites="edwardsDataSubjectsData2019 janssenPersonalInformationManagement2020 janssenDecentralizedDataProcessing2021"><a
href="#ref-edwardsDataSubjectsData2019" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a>–<a
href="#ref-janssenDecentralizedDataProcessing2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span>.</p>
<p>To further this discussion, we ask the question: “<em>What
assumptions from GDPR (and their interpretations) are still valid and
applicable for a Solid user?</em>” In order to answer this, first the
use of Solid must be understood as defined by Solid’s own
specifications. This requires identifying what a Solid Pod is, how it is
created, how it is obtained and used by individuals, and how apps
interact with the data stored in it. This also requires understanding
the possible variations that may emerge as a result of applying existing
practices for service provision by market actors, or as part of Solid’s
organic push towards re-implementing conventional models. Through these,
we who will implement and provide the various resources required by
Solid and apps, how will users be involved in these processes, and who
retains what degree of control. After establishing the basics of who
does what in an implementation, the use-case must be interpreted through
the investigative lens of GDPR, where the roles of controllers,
processors, data subjects, and third-parties must be use-case. Then, the
obligations associated with each entity must be assessed for
applicability and fulfilment in order to determine compliance. Finally,
for ensuring progress and benefits, we need to explore practical
implications arising from Solid implementations by exploring how
existing issues also apply to Solid-based use-cases, and identify
specific paths for improvements and mitigation through developments
involving Solid itself.</p>
<p>To enable these processes for Solid, we explore the primary questions
as follows. To assist with understanding Solid, we summarise its
specifications and relevant work in Section <a href="#sec:background"

</ol>
<p>The outcomes of this work are intended to benefit Solid stakeholders
in understanding and applying GDPR (and other legal) concepts to their
use-cases and thereby inform future technical and legal developments in
the use of Solid. The intention of this article is to also highlight the
risks involved in use of Solid. here is no necessity or obligation for
the Solid community to fix identified issues, especially where they are
broader and universal in the context of web and applications. However,
we hope that in highlighting them, Solid’s vision of using
decentralisation and machine-readable information to empower users in
controlling their data can benefit from identification of potential
paths to mitigate known issues and innovate on better privacy mechanisms
through developments within, using, and led by Solid itself.</p>
<h2 id="sec:background">Background Information and Relevant Work

<h3 id="what-is-solid">What is Solid?</h3>
<p>Solid describes itself as a ‘specification’ for decentralised
‘<em>data stores</em>’ called ‘<em>Pods</em>’ that act as ‘<em>secure
personal web servers for data</em>’ with controls for accessing and
using stored data. The Solid protocols <span class="citation"
data-cites="SolidProtocol"><a href="#ref-SolidProtocol"
role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span> define use of web-based technologies
for creating and using <em>applications</em> that act on data within
Pods. They also define functionalities related to identity <span
class="citation" data-cites="SolidWebIDProfile"><a
href="#ref-SolidWebIDProfile" role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></span>,
access control authorisations <span class="citation"
data-cites="WebAccessControl AccessControlPolicy"><a
href="#ref-WebAccessControl" role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a>, <a
href="#ref-AccessControlPolicy" role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span>,
handling of requests and notifications, governance of app requests and
data access <span class="citation"
data-cites="SolidApplicationInteroperability"><a
href="#ref-SolidApplicationInteroperability"
role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></span>, and security considerations for
implementations. The Solid project’s website<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
showcases existing applications and development tools.</p>
<p>In Solid, users and applications are represented as <em>Agents</em>
whose identity is represented by a URL that also provides information
(e.g. profile, metadata) and is used authorisations. Apps request access
using pre-defined methods, to which users can grant access and also
revoke it later. Access to data within Solid specifications is
determined based on: (1) data in question; (2) operation to be
performed; and (3) entity requesting access - where the entity can be a
process, an app, or user. These are expressed using <em>Access
Request</em> which user decision that are stored as <em>Access
Authorisations</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="SolidApplicationInteroperability"><a
href="#ref-SolidApplicationInteroperability"
role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></span>. Details of access are provided to
requestors (e.g. apps) as <em>Access Grants</em> with specifics of what
the access entails. The data within scope of an access is specified
using <em>Data Grants</em>. The <em>Access Need</em> concept specifies
information on necessity of information (required or optional), scenario
(personal or shared access), description (human-intended text), with
possible grouping into sets for collective reference and application
<span class="citation" data-cites="SolidApplicationInteroperability"><a
href="#ref-SolidApplicationInteroperability"
role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></span>. We summarise this current model as
the tuple: <span
class="math inline">{<em>d</em><em>a</em><em>t</em><em>a</em>, <em>o</em><em>p</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>a</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>n</em>, <em>n</em><em>e</em><em>c</em><em>e</em><em>s</em><em>s</em><em>i</em><em>t</em><em>y</em>, <em>j</em><em>u</em><em>s</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>f</em><em>i</em><em>c</em><em>a</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>n</em>, <em>a</em><em>g</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>t</em>}</span>.</p>
<h3 id="known-implementations-and-use-cases">Known Implementations and
Use-Cases</h3>
<p>Solid as a specification has implementations<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
that are open and community-led, as well as closed-sourced commercial
variants. These are utilised by <em>Pod Providers</em> to provision
services with varying levels of freedoms (e.g. control over
infrastructure) where either they or the users can choose providers for
domains and servers, with choice of locations (as jurisdictions). In
addition, Solid can also be self-hosted, e.g. by manually installing it
on a user-controlled server.</p>
<p>Notably, the Flemish government in Belgium has embarked on an project
whereby all citizens will be provided a Solid Pod for storage and
control over their government-issued documents apps can request access
to based on the user’s consent only after establishing legal agreements
with the government-established Data Utility Company outlining permitted
purposes and processing <span class="citation"

<h2 id="sec:understanding-solid-cloud">Solid as ‘Cloud Technology’</h2>
<h3
id="motivation-for-explicitly-defining-solid-as-a-cloud-technology">Motivation
for explicitly defining Solid as a Cloud technology</h3>
<p>ISO/IEC 17788:2014 Information technology — Cloud computing —
Overview and vocabulary <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO-17788"><a
href="#ref-ISO-17788" role="doc-biblioref">[29]</a></span> defines
<em>cloud computing</em> as a “Paradigm for enabling network access to a
scalable and elastic pool of shareable physical or virtual resources
with self-service provisioning and administration on-demand” where
resources can be servers, networks, software, applications, storage,
etc. It defines <em>cloud services</em> as “One or more capabilities
offered via cloud computing invoked using a defined interface”. This
definition suits implementations where a Solid Pod is a form of cloud
service that enables applications and (cloud) services to utilise store
data. Since the Solid specifications do not place limits on how storage
and computing is built and provided, we can apply the full extent of
existing cloud infrastructure and provision methods to describe possible
implementations.</p>
<p>By defining Solid as a Cloud technology, we benefit from identifying
and applying relevant cloud terminologies, standards, guidelines, legal
requirements and obligations, and utilise existing domain expertise. For
example, using ISO 35.210 Cloud Computing<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
standards for security, handling of sensitive data, interoperability,
portability, policy management, and data governance; or ENISA’s Cloud
Computing Risk Assessment <span class="citation"
data-cites="CloudComputingRisk"><a href="#ref-CloudComputingRisk"
role="doc-biblioref">[30]</a></span> cybersecurity GDPR guidance on
Controllers and Processors <span class="citation"
data-cites="EDPSGuidelinesConcepts2019"><a
href="#ref-EDPSGuidelinesConcepts2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[31]</a></span> that outlines requirements and
responsibilities for use of cloud-based technologies through market
providers.</p>
<p>use-cases first requires accurately representing the specifics in
terms of actors, processes, and information flows. For Solid, we reuse
the existing Cloud technology concepts adapted from ISO/IEC 22123-1:2021
Information technology — Cloud computing — Part 1: Vocabulary <span
class="citation" data-cites="ISO-22123"><a href="#ref-ISO-22123"
role="doc-biblioref">[32]</a></span> to provide a framework through
which implementations of Solid as cloud technologies can be documented
for common understanding. For this exercise, we first checked whether
each term had relevance to Solid and the topic of this paper, and then
rephrased their definitions to specify relevant descriptions of
information associated with use of Solid Pods. The findings are
summarised as a collection of entities in Fig <a href="#fig-cloud"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig-cloud">1</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig-cloud">
	<img src="img/057-cloud.png">
<figcaption>Simplified representation of applying Cloud paradigms to
provisioning Solid Pods</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="actors">Actors</h3>
<p><em>Actors</em> refer to entities that have specific roles within the
Solid ecosystem. Currently Solid specifications only refer to
<em>Agents</em>, <em>Social Agents</em>, and <em>Applications</em>. We
use the cloud-based terms from ISO/IEC terminology since they have
standardised definitions and interpretations and also have relevance in
legal compliance investigations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Provider</em> - entity that makes available Pods or relevant
resources (storage, computing, identity, application, domain, etc.),
with prefixes indicating contextual concepts such as – <em>pod
provider</em> for the entity that provides Pods, <em>app provider</em>
for providing an app, <em>storage provider</em> for providing storage,
and so on. Note that this concept only refers to the <em>provision</em>,
which is separate from <em>development</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Customer</em> - entity that has a ‘business relationship’ for
the purpose of using Pods or its relevant resources. This includes
purchasing, leasing, subscribing, or establishing any form of contract
or agreement, with or without monetary transactions. Customers typically
will have a direct relationship with a provider, which may be
facilitated by one or more <em>broker</em> entities. For example, a
<em>pod broker</em> is an entity that negotiates a relationship between
a <em>customer</em> and a <em>pod provider</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Developer</em> - entity with the responsibility for
designing, developing, testing, and maintaining implementations of Solid
Pods, applications, or relevant resources. Similar to <em>provider</em>,
this concept can also be prefixed to indicate contextual roles, such as
– <em>pod developer</em> for the entity that is responsible for
development of Pods (as platforms, software, or apps), <em>app
developer</em> for apps, and so on. Providers and developers are
important concepts to distinguish since they determine accountability
and responsibility for resources, and may have obligations depending on
the extent of their role in provision and development
respectively.</p></li>
<li><p><em>User</em> - natural person that uses Pods or relevant
resources. Note that the ISO/IEC definition here also includes what
Solid considers <em>Agents</em> as users, e.g. devices and applications.
We make the distinction between <em>User</em> and <em>Agent</em> so as
to distinguish between human and machine-based agencies - which is
necessary to later analyse processes such as consent. We also
distinguish between customer and user since they may not be the same -
for example when a Pod customer is a company that provisions Pods from a
provider, customises it, and provides it to (end-)users. In this case,
the company is a provider for the end-users but a customer for Pod
providers.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Data Subject</em> - the individual that is the
<em>subject</em> of the data within a Pod, and who may be different from
the user. While ISO/IEC uses the terms PII Principal and Data Principal,
we use data subject for its accuracy in this context as well as for
consistency with GDPR investigations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Solid specifications use the term <em>Owner</em> with the definition
as: “An owner is a person or a social entity that is considered to have
the rights and responsibilities of a data storage. ”. However, this term
is problematic in that it may get interpreted as referring to <em>data
ownership</em> which is a specific legally relevant concept, and may
produce unintended applications in terms of copyright and intellectual
property rights. It also creates issues through use of
<em>responsibilities</em> which are based on legal obligations and
rights, and which do not necessarily fall upon the individuals. To avoid
such implications and to restrict interpretations to well-established
common practices, standards, and legal norms - we only use terms from
ISO and GDPR.</p>
<h3 id="functionalities">Functionalities</h3>
<p><em>Functionality</em> refers to the capability or feature exhibited
by a Solid Pod or its related resources such as storage, computing,
identity, or applications. Functionalities can be categorised based on
capabilities, interoperability, and portability of data and
applications. <em>Pod capabilities</em> is the classification of
capabilities that an implementation of a Pod supports in terms of
letting customers or users manage them. For example, support for adding
additional storage, a computing or execution environment, or
pre-configured applications. Capabilities can be described in relation
to three broad concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Application</em> - how users manage applications. This
relates to how users discover application, interact with requests for
data use, ‘install’ apps, and perform configuration or other management
and governance related tasks.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Platform</em> - whether users can deploy, manage, and run
processes. This relates to whether the relevant tasks necessary for a
Pod - such as identity verification, authorisation, policy management,
or anything that requires computing or execution can be managed by the
users, or is provided via pre-configured environments, or can also be
modified by users and/or applications for supporting other
functionalities.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Infrastructure</em> - whether users can provision and control
resources related to a Pod or an app, such as storage, computing,
networks, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Pod service category</em> is the classification of services
supported by a Pod based on available capabilities. This defines how
Pods are implemented using physical and virtual resources e.g. as
Applications, Platforms, and Infrastructure, and how they are provided
to customers or users. This section does not list the full extent of how
cloud technologies and services can be provisioned in terms of ‘anything
as a service’ (XaaS), but only considers the broad categories necessary
to describe use-cases with concise and complete information.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</em> - Users can control
infrastructure (e.g. storage space, computing servers) directly, with
potential limitations to use specific providers or offered choices e.g.
operating systems, networking components (e.g. web server, firewalls),
data stores (e.g. databases or triple-stores), and virtualisation
capabilities. Solid Pods can be readily deployed as self-controlled
servers in an IaaS environment<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</em> - Users of a Pod are given
a ‘platform’ through which they exercise their control over apps and
resources without explicitly dealing with the underlying infrastructure.
Platforms determine how users interact with their Pods, data, and
applications, and are not currently defined by the Solid specifications.
A platform can be a dedicated development over a Solid server instance,
or be an extension of existing platforms to support Solid as additional
protocols. Examples of platforms as both dedicated services (e.g. Inrupt
Pod Spaces<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> and extensions (e.g. NextCloud <a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> are available in Solid’s
documentation.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Software as a Service (SaaS)</em> - Users use Pods via
controlled interfaces (e.g. web-browsers, smartphone apps) and do not
control resources. See ‘Pod Providers’ on Solid’s website<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> for
examples.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Compute as a Service (CaaS)</em> - Providers provide
dedicated computing environments controlled by the user (server or
serverless) process execution, e.g. to their own data or to enforce
controlled environments.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Storage as a Service (STaaS)</em> - This is a hypothetical
extension where different forms of storage as a service. For example,
SQL database, semantic-web triple-stores, binary or blob storages, or
dedicated media storage services such as for photos and videos.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Data as a Service (DaaS)</em> - a service between data and
apps that provides data-value and data-utility. For example, when
companies and applications do not need to centrally collect, store, and
manage data, but instead utilise the availability of data within a Solid
Pod directly by using it on demand. These may include operations over
(raw) data, invoke specific queries to get answers, be limited to only
data collection or storage, or also involve storing ephemeral and
persistent outputs from processes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The ISO/IEC cloud standards define <em>Portability</em> as “ability
to migrate an application from one cloud service to another”. Applied to
Solid, portability refers to the extent to which data and applications
can be migrated (i.e. moved) to another Pod, for example as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Data portability</em> - data can be migrated or moved outside
of the Pod;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Application portability</em> - apps can be moved between
Pods;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Pods portability</em> - Pods can be moved between
providers;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Data Synctactic portability</em> - data is ported using
well-defined data formats;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Data Semantic portability</em> - data is ported using defined
semantics and data models;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Data Policy portability</em> - data is ported while complying
with relevant policies;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Application Synctactic portability</em> - apps are ported by
utilising well-defined formats;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Application Instruction portability</em> - app instructions
(i.e. executable code) can be ported;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Application Metadata portability</em> - app metadata, such as
profiles or established permissions and authorisations, can be ported to
another Pod;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Application Behaviour portability</em> - apps are ported
without changes in functionality; and</p></li>
<li><p><em>Application Policy portability</em> - apps are ported while
complying with relevant policies.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The ISO/IEC cloud standards define <em>Interoperability</em> as
“ability of two or more systems or applications to exchange information
and to mutually use the information that has been exchanged”. Applied to
Solid Pods, interoperability refers to how Pods and applications can
exchange and mutually use data. In this, portability only refers to the
ability to migrate or move data or apps outside of a Pod, while
interoperability also refers to the usefulness of that data or app in
the new Pod. For interoperability, the following interpretations for
Solid are provided based on ISO/IEC defined forms of
interoperability:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Pods interoperability</em> - Data and apps in a Pod are
interoperable with other Pods (same or different provider), and Pods
support import/export features to achieve this.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Application interoperability</em> - Data is interoperable
across different apps (same or different provider), and apps support
import/export features to achieve this.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Data interoperability</em> - Data is interoperable with other
data from the same or different provider. This means both data providers
and/or consumers support the same (or a set of) data formats or schemas
to achieve the interoperability.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Synctactic interoperability</em> - Data and apps use
interoperable formats that are understood by both providers and
consumers (e.g. CSV, JSON) to achieve interoperability;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Semantic interoperability</em> - Data and apps use
well-defined schemas, ontologies, or data models that are understood by
both providers and consumers.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Behavioural interoperability</em> - Interoperability does not
detriment functionality.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Policy interoperability</em> - Interoperability takes places
while maintaining compliance with legal, organisational, Pod, service,
or user policies.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-categories">Data categories</h3>
<p>While Solid Pods are defined as a data storage service for
individuals to store and control their (personal) data, they can also
contain several other categories relevant to the functioning of Pods,
applications, and services – specified by ISO/IEC terminology as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Personal Data</em> - category for data associated with an
individual (where exact definition depends on jurisdiction).
Non-personal data is data that is not associated with an individual.
Note that this concept is broader than PII which relates to
<em>identifiability</em> of the data with an individual - for example,
removal of identifiers may suffice to make the data non-PII but it would
still be personal data, whereas its (complete) anonymisation results in
non-personal data.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Customer Data</em> or <em>user data</em> to refer to data
being under the (legal, contractual, or other forms of) control by
customers and users respectively. If customers, users, and data subjects
are distinct - their respective data categories will also be
distinct.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Derived Data</em> - category for data produced as a result of
interactions with services and applications. This can be logs such as
those associated with data access, usage, or processes. It also includes
data associated with authorisations, e.g. produced as a result of
managing permissions for an app.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Provider Data</em> - category for data under the control of
providers - such as configurations for provisioned Pods, resources, or
applications, or logs relevant to operational processes such as
identities or used to calculate charges for use of resources.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Account Data</em> - information about accounts regarding
Pods, resources, and apps.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Protected Data</em> - data needed to be protected by
provider, user, or application.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Publicly Accessible Data</em> - publicly accessible data<a
href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, where publicly does not imply
visibility or accessibility, but should be interpreted as specifying
access within contextual boundaries.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In these definitions, while <em>sensitive</em> information and data
are not explicitly defined, they are covered through other ISO/IEC
standards related to data security and governance, such as ISO/IEC
19944-1:2020 Cloud computing and distributed platforms - Data flow, data
categories and data use Part 1: Fundamentals <span class="citation"
data-cites="ISO-19944-1"><a href="#ref-ISO-19944-1"
role="doc-biblioref">[33]</a></span> which refers to sensitive data
categories associated with children, finance, health, and medicine - and
provides guidance on how these are to be managed within cloud-based data
flows. Through these, we understand the necessity to categorise data
based on relevance to operations, actors, as well as sensitivity, and to
use these categorisations within the relevant processes associated with
security and oversight. Solid specifications currently do not explicitly
define such categorisations, though they do support declaration of
categories for specific data within a Pod.</p>
<h3 id="contracts-and-agreements">Contracts and Agreements</h3>
<p>The use of Solid Pods, related resources, applications, and other
services is governed through agreements and contracts<a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
between providers and customer or users. ISO/IEC terminology describes
<em>service agreement</em> as an agreement between a provider and a
customer regarding the provision of specific services. It also defines
<em>service level agreements</em> (SLA) between providers, customers,
and suppliers that identifies the services, how they are to be provided,
their targets, commitment to specific objectives and their qualitative
characteristics, and which can be part of another contract or agreement.
The distinction between the two relates to the amount of details and
specifics in terms of what the service entails and what should be
provided and/or expected regarding its use.</p>
<p>Applied for Solid, agreements can be associated with Pods, resources
(e.g. storage, computing, identity), Apps, or Users. These can relate to
specific functionalities (e.g. Pod storage space, computing in hours,
resources for a specific app), and can be individually managed by
customers or be part of a common contract governing terms of use for
Pods and apps. In addition to these, the specific contracts and
consenting agreements established by users are separate concepts which
do not feature within ISO/IEC cloud-based terminologies, but are instead
covered in separate standards associated with privacy - such as ISO/IEC
29184:2020 Information technology — Online privacy notices and consent
<span class="citation" data-cites="ISO29184"><a href="#ref-ISO29184"
role="doc-biblioref">[34]</a></span>.</p>
<p>The Solid specifications currently do not support or specify any form
of agreements regarding provisioning of Pods or resources, or for Apps.
However, Pod service agreements are mentioned externally - for example
as part of information on where to find a Pod provider. For interactions
between Apps and users, the specifications only refer to ‘authorisation’
that are recorded and stored within the Pod.</p>
<h2 id="sec:understanding-solid-layers">Functionality Layers in a Solid
Pod</h2>
<p>In this section, we explore functionalities in terms of how data is
stored, retrieved, and used through a Pod. In this, the relevance of
cloud technologies is apparent in that each functionality can be
implemented using a different and distinct set of technologies, and can
be associated with a different cloud-based actor. These also relate to
different capability types - such as where functionalities are
implemented as infrastructures, platforms, or services.</p>
<p>The functionalities are represented as <em>layers</em> based on the
systemic influence they have on each other where each layer depends on
the implementation of the layers below it to define its own
functionality. The layers are intended to assist in conceptual
description of Solid’s implementations and provide a common basis for
co-ordination of efforts associated with each ‘layer’. This is based on
the OSI model consisting 7 layers describing communication of
information between two systems <span class="citation"
data-cites="ISO-7498"><a href="#ref-ISO-7498"
role="doc-biblioref">[35]</a></span>.</p>
<p>The layers also represent a ‘separation of concerns’, and act as a
framework for indicating the scope of developments by indicating the
affected layers. For example, a data storage solution has immediate
relevance for the data retrieval layer as a dependancy, but is not as
strongly coupled with the interface layer. This separation of
functionalities as layers also assists later in the establishment of
processes regarding accountability - such as notices and consent,
security measures, and identifying the role of entities in determining
how data is being collected and used based on which layers they control
and what limitations are imposed. In addition, the layers enable
accurate analysis of cases where Pods may be provisioned with specific
limitations on some of these functionalities which may result in
restrictions on portability and interoperability of data and apps.</p>
<p>We identified the following layers (see Fig <a href="#fig-layers"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig-layers">2</a>) by
distinguishing between implementations of Solid Pods and applications in
terms of interactions with data: <em>data storage</em> as the bottom
layer given Solid’s reliance on data storage as a central concept,
followed by <em>data retrieval</em> to retrieve stored data,
<em>computing</em> to (optionally) perform computations on it,
<em>access control</em> to control retrieval of information,
<em>communication</em> to share information between entities and
resources – and finally <em>interface</em> for interactions and
management processes by <em>actors</em>. Orthogonal to these are layers
associated with <em>logging</em>, <em>policies</em>, <em>security</em>,
and <em>identity</em> which have relevance to and are influenced from
implementations of each layer.</p>
<figure id="fig-layers">

layers based on functionalities</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="data-storage-layer">Data Storage Layer</h3>
<h4 id="physical-and-virtual-views">Physical and Virtual Views</h4>
<p>The Data Storage layer refers to the physical and virtual arrangement
of data within a Pod or its aligned resources. Here, physical refers to
the actual data storage mechanism e.g. disks, bytes, or file systems,
and virtual refers to non-physical or logical arrangements that provide
alternative ways to represent and arrange data as an abstraction over
underlying data mechanisms. An example of these is how a specific URL
representing a path to a resource may or may not correspond to the
actual location of that resource within a server. Another example is the
encapsulation of information, such as a URL with a fragment identifier
representing a specific element within the HTML document.</p>
<p>Defining virtual or logical views over physical resources enables
data to be provided and stored using semantics or schemas - such as
within databases. This enables the same physical data resource to be
represented and used as different virtual resources, which opens
possibilities for content negotiation and richer use of data within
applications based on synctactic and semantic interoperability. For
example, a collection of bytes on a disk can be interpreted as byte
streams, documents, or semantic data (e.g. RDF triples), or they can be
converted on-demand to requested formats and schemas.</p>
<p>The governance of access modes is based on how data can be stored,
read, used, queried, and controlled – which affects how data and access
are communicated. The current Solid specifications specifiy URLs for
accessing data, which is similar to how documents are stored using
file-paths. Virtualisation can be used to expand what the paths point
towards, e.g. through the web server to map different paths to different
data or retrieval methods. However, there are strong arguments to take
advantage of the virtualisation to promote greater and innovative use of
data beyond fixed documents and formats <span class="citation"
data-cites="dedeckerWhatPod2022"><a href="#ref-dedeckerWhatPod2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[23]</a></span>.</p>
<h4 id="cataloguing">Cataloguing</h4>
<p>The data storage layer also determines how data can be grouped
together, such as in the form of folders, catalogues, registries, or
collections. Such arrangements are crucial to create logical views that
enable easier storage and access to related data within the same
context. For example, apps such those for contact books and photo albums
rely on such contextual arrangements <span class="citation"
data-cites="dedeckerWhatPod2022"><a href="#ref-dedeckerWhatPod2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[23]</a></span>. Limitations on the ability to have
more than one grouping for the same data also places limitations on how
it can be reused, as well as creates issues regarding privacy due to
lack of separation capabilities <span class="citation"
data-cites="dedeckerWhatPod2022"><a href="#ref-dedeckerWhatPod2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[23]</a></span>. Solid specifications currently
specify <em>Data Instance</em> as a specific and unique instance of data
that conforms to a <em>Shape Tree</em> (a specific schema), which is
stored within a <em>Data Registry</em>. However, these do no resolve
issues of limitations on data reuse since such shapes can be different
for each user and app without a way to support interoperability between
data providers and data consumers.</p>
<h4 id="data-partitioning-and-mirroring">Data Partitioning and
Mirroring</h4>
<p>Data partitioning is the separation of data, typically undertaken for
considerations of efficiency, performance, control, or contextual needs.
For example, data more likely to be requested from specific locations is
stored closer to those locations to improve retrieval speeds. Another
example is where sensitive data is stored in a separate physical or
virtual location which can be supplemented with dedicated security
measures. Data mirroring is the duplication of data - which can be
performed separately or alongside partitioning for the same reasons of
increased availability and efficiency, as well as to reduce costs
arising from network egress. Both of these are common aims when using
Cloud Delivery Networks (CDNs), typically provided by a third party.</p>
<p>For Solid, a Pod is considered as a holistic storage managed under a
single identifier (i.e. an IRI for the Pod). Internally, it can be split
into separate instances, each of which can be a virtual resource
attached to a Pod, or be separate Pods themselves. While the
specifications themselves do not explore this topic in detail, we later
reuse these concepts in terms of how apps and users manage data, their
usefulness towards having additional security for sensitive information,
and using partitioning and mirroring to ensure (some) data is always
stored or available within a jurisdiction.</p>
<h3 id="data-retrieval-layer">Data Retrieval Layer</h3>
<h4 id="retrieval-forms">Retrieval Forms</h4>
<p>The retrieval of data is based on data storage layer in terms of
physical arrangements - such as retrieving data as bytes, blobs, or
streams; and virtual arrangements - such as retrieving using specific
formats or schemas. In addition, the data storage layer also affects
retrieval by defining how data can be accessed in terms of identifiers,
paths, and arrangements. The implementation of the data storage layer
therefore affects the retrieval of data in terms of enabling or
disabling the abilities through which users and apps can access that
data. For example, if data can only be retrieved as binary documents and
using paths to specify targets - apps must either be developed to use
this arrangement or require additional efforts to convert it into
required arrangements.</p>
<p>Data retrieval can be implemented directly by the Pod (i.e. as
operating software), or by intermediaries (e.g. apps, services,
manually) – where the support for specific forms and requirements for
retrieval determines what capabilities are possible and feasible for use
of data. For example, if retrieval supports entire documents rather than
individual records or partial data, apps such as contact books will
request access to all possible data in order to retrieve names and
contact numbers <span class="citation"
data-cites="dedeckerWhatPod2022"><a href="#ref-dedeckerWhatPod2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[23]</a></span>. In such cases, where data storage
may not support virtualisation by itself, retrieval can utilise
intermediaries to collect and strip the data of unwanted elements to
only return requested information.</p>
<p>Solid specifications currently specify retrieval using IRI or URLs
indicating the path of data, which is then handled by the Pod server to
retrieve corresponding documents or <em>data instances</em>. Other forms
of retrieval can also be added to this, for example as APIs over URLs to
specify metadata such as requested formats, queries, or other pertinent
information. Well-defined URLs can also be used to provide a common
method to obtain data based on categories, formats, schemas, etc. For
example, <em>/data/contacts</em> as a common way to retrieve contacts
irrespective of how they are actually stored within the Pod, and using
parameters to specify formats or limit number of records.</p>
<h4 id="querying-data">Querying Data</h4>
<p>Retrieval can also be based on queries - where specific criteria and
constraints are expressed with which to identify and retrieve selective
information. Queries can also provide a solution to the selective
information problem described above, and also enable clearer access to
information by specifying only relevant information to be retrieved.
Further, queries can be used to create ad-hoc documents, or graphs, in
requested formats - thereby also assisting in issues related to
interoperability of information. An additional utilisation of queries,
as a broad concept and form of information retrieval, is to specify
derivations (e.g. conversion of values) and inferences (e.g. derive
statistical analytics) over data within the Pod. This allows apps to
request information without accessing the data in question since the
queries would only return the requested (generated) information.</p>
<p>However, compared to path-based document retrieval, queries are more
expensive in terms of computation, more difficult to assess in terms of
permission and privacy, and require more logic to be available for
handling calls and results. Solid specifications currently do not
specify any form of querying or mention support for its development,
though approaches have been proposed to move Solid’s storage and
retrieval mechanisms from document-based to knowledge-graph <span
class="citation" data-cites="dedeckerWhatPod2022"><a
href="#ref-dedeckerWhatPod2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[23]</a></span>.</p>
<h3 id="computation-layer">Computation Layer</h3>
<h4 id="pods-as-controlled-execution-environments">Pods as Controlled
Execution Environments</h4>
<p>Alongside queries, computational resources associated with Pods also
provide the opportunity to create user-controlled execution environments
which can be used to run processes <em>locally</em>. In this, since the
data never leaves the Pod or its associated (user-controlled) resources,
the overall process can become more trustworthy than sending the data to
an app. This is an especially powerful paradigm for several cases, such
as: (i) where computations do not need large amounts of data and are
infrequent; (ii) they involve sensitive data; (iii) the apps and actors
cannot be trusted to keep data; (iv) the apps and actors cannot be
trusted to delete data after use; and (v) the user wants to control the
process themselves - e.g. to ensure there is no bias or inaccuracy in
outputs.</p>
<p>The code or instructions required for computation can be provided by
an app, or it can be retrieved by the user through methods provided by
the app. For example, to calculate the statistical mean of the user’s
walking distance in the past week, the app can either submit a detailed
query with the mean calculation, or only indicate the method
<em>mean</em> with parameters based on some common understanding on how
it should be executed. Alternatively, the Pod itself can determine
functions to execute based on information requested. From previous
example, the app only requests ‘mean walking distance’ (e.g. using a
URL, query, API), and the Pod interprets the query, identifies and
performs the computations involved, and returns results.</p>
<h4 id="cost-of-computations">Cost of Computations</h4>
<p>Computations can be costly to execute based on their complexity and
resource availability. Since Solid does not requires Pods to have
computational capacities beyond those required to perform basic
operations related to data storage, retrieval, identity management, and
access control, computational resources cannot be assumed to be present
in all Pods. Which means the support for computations would be added
separately by users - for example through provisioned servers or
serverless environments, which may vary between Pods and providers. And
if these are restricted to using specific vendors or platforms - can
affect the interoperability of information and behaviours associated
with use of Solid Pods.</p>
<p>In addition to dedicated computations generally having some
<em>cost</em> involved regarding processing resources or time, there may
also be computations inherently involved in retrieval mechanisms – such
as converting the stored data into requested forms. For example, there
are computations involved in mapping request paths to underlying folder
structures on a server, or looking up indexes for which data paths are
to be retrieved for a given API, or executing queries (of various
complexities) to selectively retrieve information. These may result in
additional <em>costs</em> if such features are not part of the Pod
infrastructure and services, or are metered based on quotas. For
example, several cloud providers charge the use of network
communications (ingress/egress) with some initial amount provided for
free. If users are not aware of this, even seemingly simple retrievals
may end up costing money.</p>
<p>Cloud services also enable providing virtual models over existing
data through the Data as a Service (DaaS) paradigm. One way to utilise
this within the Solid ecosystem, is to provide DaaS features where apps
can request (raw) data, information (e.g. in a schema), or answers (e.g.
as queries - see retrieval in next subsection). In this case, the cost
of retrieval can be paid by apps or shared with the users. This can also
be used to incentivise data providers to submit data in well-defined and
supported forms, or to offset their non-conformance by enabling other
data consumers to convert the data in order to use it. Another avenue is
to federate processes so that not all retrieval related computations
take place on Pods, and instead some data is processed on the apps’
servers or client-side (e.g. a web browser), such as through use of
Triple Pattern Fragments (TPF) <span class="citation"
data-cites="verborghTriplePatternFragments2016"><a
href="#ref-verborghTriplePatternFragments2016"
role="doc-biblioref">[36]</a></span>.</p>
<h3 id="access-control-layer">Access Control Layer</h3>
<p>Access Control refers to the method by which access to data within a
Pod is controlled. It relies on the data retrieval and data storage
layers to define how data is identified (e.g. specifying its path) and
the method by which it is accessed (e.g. also by path, or API, or
query). Its scope is limited to operations over data within a Pod, i.e.
read, write, and erase, and excludes control over how that data is used
or disseminated or managed once it leaves the Pod (instead, this is
specified by policies in a later section).</p>
<p>In the current Solid specifications, access control is implemented as
a user accepting a request from an agent (e.g. app) for operations
(read, write, erase) over data (as URLs). In this, the specifications do
not clarify how such URLs paths are mapped to data categories, or
express complex conditions as policies based on agent class, resource
class, and origin information, constraints and conditions of use – which
are important as they are parts of service agreements and have legal
implications.</p>
<p>For a Pod to implement different data storage and retrieval
mechanisms, it would also need corresponding support from access control
mechanisms to specify who can access data. Similarly, if retrieval
methods can utilise queries and computations, these would also need
support from access control mechanisms to control who can perform them
and who they relate to data. For example, an app is permitted to
retrieve only statistical mean using queries can exploit lack of control
over what data can be queried to perform inference attacks to retrieve
data. Therefore, the correspondence between access control and data
retrieval methods also becomes relevant to the implementation and
investigation of security issues beyond simple interpretations of
permissions and access to data.</p>
<h3 id="communication-layer">Communication Layer</h3>
<p>Communication here refers to the method by which data and access is
communicated (i.e. provided, requested, retrieved) in the context of a
Pod. Solid specifications utilise web protocols (HTTP) for communication
of data and access control requests, where URLs are used to identify
Pods, data within Pods, agents, and other resources. The HTTP protocols
(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) are used to express interactions with
resources. These are then utilised by users and apps to interact with
Pods and the data they contain. Once access authorisations have been
established, subsequent communications as per the Solid specifications
are required to provide a security token that proves prior relationship
and which can be verified as being valid.</p>
<p>If the data retrieval and access control mechanisms can utilise other
forms of identifiers for referring to data, or support operations not
part of the current access control methods supported by Solid, the
communication layer will also need to be modified to support these. For
example, the current URL based method presumes corresponding access
control permissions based on that specific path. If this is not the
case, and paths are virtual views that are not the same underlying data
storage or retrieval paths, then the communication layer would require
to be aware of such changes so as to accept these requests.</p>
<p>Similarly, if communication includes additional content such as
policies or other metadata related to use of data or apps, the
corresponding aspects of how apps declare themselves or perform initial
authorisation requests and subsequent data use requests also needs to
incorporate these changes. Finally, other forms of communication methods
such as well-defined or common established URLs, or APIs, can be
established as wrappers around existing HTTP/URL based methods to
provide the necessary abstraction to hide implementation details of pods
and data (e.g. exact path for data) from external agents.</p>
<h3 id="interface-layer">Interface Layer</h3>
<p>The interface layer is where the users (i.e. humans) interact with a
Pod and manage their data and access to it for apps. This includes
features that use UI/UX in the form of panels, dashboards, or similar
design elements. Currently, the Solid specification does not provide any
such feature, and leave it to the Pod providers to implement one for
their users. The Solid website lists applications<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
providing interfaces as file managers, messaging clients, calendars, and
inbox management for app requests and notifications.</p>
<p>An important consideration in the development of such interfaces is
what functionality they depend on within Solid Pods. For example, file
managers rely on data storage and retrieval methods to understand what
should be presented to the users. Similarly, contacts and calendar apps
rely on the ability to retrieve relevant data and metadata to populate
their respective interfaces. If the data storage and retrieval forms are
fixed, then these apps can only utilise that as the basis to provide
their functionalities - which can result in unintended excessive data
exposure as well as difficulties in getting exactly or only the data
required and in the correct forms <span class="citation"
data-cites="dedeckerWhatPod2022"><a href="#ref-dedeckerWhatPod2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[23]</a></span>.</p>
<p>Another consideration for interfaces is that if they require some
computation and are expected to be executed on the client side (e.g. by
the Pod or a web browser), there is no way to express or distinguish
this from those that are a front-end to an external server. Users of
interfaces thus may not be aware that they are interacting with an
external agent or a locally executed process (which may or may not be
controlled by an external agent).</p>
<p>Interfaces also involve the interactions that users undergo in
relation to the use of their pod, data, and apps. For example, an app’s
request to use data may be presented external to the pod as a notice on
that app’s website. This may involve information about why the app wants
to access the data, what data is wants to access, and other pertinent
information such as policies applicable. Such interfaces should also be
considered when investigating Solid’s use-cases since they are how users
make decisions on whether to grant access. In addition, these interfaces
are also important for legal investigations, such as the provision of
privacy notices or the validity of consent.</p>
<p>Other forms of interfaces include notifications, notices,
correspondences, updates, notifications, or other communications between
entities (i.e. providers, developers, brokers associated with pods,
resources, and apps) and users are also included within scope. Solid’s
inbox functionality is relevant for such communications, but is
currently limited to only handle some interactions regarding other users
and apps.</p>
<h3 id="actor-layer">Actor Layer</h3>
<p>Actors are entities associated with specific roles in relation to the
Pod, data, and apps. They use the interfaces and communication layers to
send and receive data and requests. These are distinguished from what
Solid terms as <em>Agents</em> to refer to <em>legally accountable
entities</em> so as to understand who is responsible and accountable for
implementations, decisions, and processes. For example, each of Pod,
data, and apps can have distinct actors associated with its development
(i.e. who created it or maintains it), provision (i.e. who provided it),
users (i.e. who has access to it), and investigative roles such as
auditors and governance agencies. Understanding who the actors are is a
crucial step in investigations associated with data. The actor layer
only considers those actors associated with data interactions.</p>
<p>We distinguish <em>agents</em> from an <em>actors</em> and
<em>entities</em> for the purposes of establishing accountability. This
requires identification or indication of actors with sufficient details
so as to enable legal processes to apply. A good example of this is to
specify the legal name of a company along with its address - which
enables identification of appropriate jurisdictional obligation and
authorities. Solid currently does not mandate such disclosures, but
instead leaves it up to each app to provide pertinent details via its
identity profile document. It considers domain-based identity as a
<em>strong</em> form of identification. It also does not explicitly
support or require storing legal identity or other relevant information
associated with actors within its <em>Agent Registries</em>, for example
so that the user can introspect actors and their identities at any time.
Actors are also important to explicitly identify to form an agreement
(e.g. contract, consent). Without explicit or implicit identification of
actors, the establishment of agreements between the user and an app (for
example) would not be valid or sufficient to trigger legal obligations
and remedies. Note, this only refers to cases where the information
about actors is not provided.</p>
<p>Another important consideration of actors is related to data
provenance. This refers to actors that provide specific data, and may be
required to be recorded as the source of that data. Solid’s
specifications support specifying who can write or edit data, but do not
record its provenance in a direct manner. Data source can have impact on
the validity and authentication of information - such as for official
documents, and have legal rights associated with it - such as to request
rectification of inaccuracies.</p>
<h3 id="logging-layer-orthogonal">Logging Layer (Orthogonal)</h3>
<p>Logging refers to generating and storing information about processes
and interactions in relation to the Pod, data, or apps as a form of
record-keeping. Logs can be distinguished as data logs (read, write,
edit, erase), access control logs (recording creation and use of
permissions), policies, identity management (e.g. registration,
verification), and security (e.g. incident reports). In addition to
these, logs may also be kept by pod, app, and data providers for
contextual reasons such as to assist in resolving operational issues. We
distinguish logs as being supplementary from intentional persistent
information such as an index of access authorisations.</p>
<p>Logging is expressed as an orthogonal layer as it can apply
individually or collectively to all other layers. For example, logs can
be limited to data storage mechanisms e.g. kept by the storage provider,
or data retrieval methods e.g. kept by a server handling requests, or
computing layer e.g. recording computations being executed, or access
control layer e.g. record success/failure of requests.</p>
<p>Logs can stored as data within a Pod, and can constitute as personal
data based on their contents. They may be mandatory and beyond control
of the user, for example - as provider data to keep track of resource
usage. Logs may be protected due to their sensitivity or importance in
establishing accountability, for example - strong limitations on who can
write and view access control logs in a Pod.</p>
<p>Solid currently supports an extremely limited form of logging, where
decisions related to authorisations are recorded in a registry, and an
<em>Access Receipt</em> is provided as a success response after
authorisation. Such receipts do not specify particulars about scope or
contents of access, how or where to store them, and are not necessary to
be exchanged.</p>
<h3 id="policy-layer-orthogonal">Policy Layer (Orthogonal)</h3>
<p>Policies are a broad term that refer to documented conditions,
constraints, or agreements regarding data, operations on data, and
actors with specific roles. In the context of Solid, policies can be
associated with each layer, and are thus expressed as an orthogonal
layer. We distinguish between the terms <em>policy</em> and
<em>agreement</em>, where a policy is considered an agreement if it can
be interpreted as a formal and binding document between actors. A policy
that is not an agreement is used to refer to documented information
regarding conditions, preferences, requirements, requests, offers, or
other similar notions associated with Pods, resources, data, or
apps.</p>
<p>Policies go beyond access control as expressed in Solid specification
as they can support conditions related to data categories, actors,
locations, jurisdictions, technical and operational requirements, as
well as richer contextual expressions such as limitations on duration,
frequency, and also involve risks and rights related concepts. These can
be expressed as abstract or universally applicable information, or refer
to specific jurisdictional interpretations, such as those explicitly
mentioning GDPR.</p>
<p>Policies can also refer to contexts outside the Pod. This is a
crucial distinction to put in scope the operations on data outside of a
Pod. For example, if an app’s policy only concerns what data it requires
initially when asking for access, but not what it can do subsequently -
this presents an issues regarding privacy and security as the app may
reuse or share that data for undeclared purposes.</p>
<p>Solid currently does not support policies beyond those associated
with access control and grouping of agents into categories. It also does
not require an app to declare what it intends to do with the data in the
form of a policy, or to record such policies within the Pod. While
policies are referred to as additional links in an app’s profile, there
are no conditions for what information should be present in them, their
completeness, or how these should be expressed in relation to the use of
data within Pods. It is important to distinguish these comments as
referring to how to retrieve and apply such policies and information to
the use of Solid Pods with the understanding that these may be
externally regulated e.g. through legal obligations.</p>
<p>Policies can also be used for governing the <em>usage of data</em>
and influencing computational executions. For example, data can be
shared with <em>sticky policies</em> that dictate the conditions under
which that data can be used as well as specifying obligations to be
fulfilled in return <span class="citation"
data-cites="havurGreaterControlTransparency2020"><a
href="#ref-havurGreaterControlTransparency2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[16]</a></span>. Similarly, <em>usage policies</em>
can be used to ensure that any processing operations on data are
performed in conformance and compliance with specific requirements and
contraints <span class="citation"
data-cites="akaichiSemanticTechnologyBased2022"><a
href="#ref-akaichiSemanticTechnologyBased2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[20]</a></span>.</p>
<h3 id="security-layer-orthogonal">Security Layer (Orthogonal)</h3>
<p>Security is a broad topic that can be applied to every other layer.
For example, data storage mechanisms can have security measures
regarding data integrity, encryption, usage limitations. Similarly, data
access methods can implement security measures in terms of placing
limitations on what data can be retrieved, or incorporate access control
and policy checking as a precursor to ensure valid access. Separately,
the servers implementing Solid Pods or associated resources can utilise
authorisation, DDoS protection, HTTPS, or other similar security
measures as part of their infrastructure and software. Given the breadth
of the topic and its universality to all aspects of Solid Pods, data,
and apps - we consider security an orthogonal layer. For clarity, we
distinguish between security and privacy as separate topics in the
context of this article.</p>
<p>Solid specifications have dedicated sections to security and privacy
considerations. For example, strong and weak identifiability of
applications is defined to distinguish security in terms of an app’s
identifiability via existing domain certification methods <span
class="citation" data-cites="SolidApplicationInteroperability"><a
href="#ref-SolidApplicationInteroperability"
role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></span>. Similarly, specific risks are
acknowledged<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> with information on their relevance
and mitigation.</p>
<h3 id="identity-management-layer-orthogonal">Identity Management Layer
(Orthogonal)</h3>
<p><em>Identity Management</em> refers to how identities of actors and
agents are managed through identifiers, credentials, authorisations, and
authentication mechanisms. This is considered an orthogonal layer since
identities may be associated with each layer. Though closely tied to
security, policy, and access control layers, the management of
identities on its own has enough significance to be considered
separately. For example, the identity of a Pod is separate from the
user’s identity - as reflected through their URLs, and which may have
their own requirements for being considered valid or trustworthy.
Identity management can also be separated based on the involvement of
entities and the resources they control. For example, a storage
provider’s identity could be a separate implementation with its own
corresponding access control methods.</p>
<p>Solid currently specifies identity management in terms of users and
apps through the use of WebID specification <span class="citation"
data-cites="SolidWebIDProfile"><a href="#ref-SolidWebIDProfile"
role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></span>. These may need to additionally
managed for use of specific resources, for example to translate an app’s
request to use some data in to a data storage provider’s identifier for
accessing data.</p>
<h2 id="sec:use-cases">Use-Cases Exploring Governance of Solid
Infrastructure and Apps</h2>
<p>The previous section established the terminology regarding actors,
roles, functions, and processes associated with Solid. This section uses
these term to describe various possible use-cases for the implementation
of Solid Pods and apps. The <em>use-cases</em> are a collection of
different permutations and combinations for how Solid Pods can be
implemented in terms of . They are not exhaustive, since there can
always be new paradigms and methods that change how implementations are
deployed and/or function. For relevance, see prior descriptions <span

<a href="#ref-janssenPersonalDataStores2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[37]</a></span>. Instead, the categorisation of
use-cases focuses on the aims of this article, which are: (1) to
identify data governance patterns involving Solid Pods; (2) express
use-cases in terms of freedoms and limitations on abilities and actors;
(3) to explore issues of trust and security that arise from specific
governance patterns; (4) to explore variations in responsibilities and
accountability; and (5) to guide how legal compliance investigations
should approach the use of Solid.</p>
<p>The use-cases are categorised based on specific topics they concern,
i.e. as Infrastructure (Section <a href="#sec:uc-infra"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:uc-infra">5.1</a>), Apps
(Section <a href="#sec:uc-apps" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:uc-apps">5.2</a>), and limitations or extensions to
functionalities ((Section <a href="#sec:uc-restrictions"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:uc-restrictions">5.3</a>).
Each of these categories reflects a separation of concerns in terms of
implementations and behaviours, and can be combined with each other to
further create more complex use-cases. For example, the use-cases
related to infrastructure where Pods are managed by providers or users
can be combined with other use-cases where apps can be installed from
anywhere or only from an ‘app-store’. Each use-case is given a unique
identifier (with prefix <em>UC-</em>) for convenience in referencing
them within discussions.</p>
<h3 id="sec:uc-infra">Use-Cases based on Infrastructure Management</h3>
<p>These use-cases are based on variations in the infrastructure used to
implement and deploy Solid Pods. They concern the developers, providers,
brokers, and consumers of Pods and associated resources (e.g. storage
space, computing environments), and how these are provisioned to the
(end-)users. These use-cases include limitations or restrictions placed
on the use of (physical) resources (e.g. what storage providers are
supported) but not those that concern how Solid as a software platform
operates (e.g. API used to access storage, or software-based
limitations). The latter categorisation is explored in Section <a
href="#sec:uc-restrictions" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:uc-restrictions">5.3</a>.</p>
<h4 id="uc-i1-completely-self-managed">UC-I1: Completely
Self-Managed</h4>
<p>The first use-case considers the user setting up everything
themselves in terms of the necessary resources (server, storage disks,
networking, domains). This could be a typical home-setup where the user
runs the server within their home or a commercial setup where an
organisation deploys servers from their premises. It provides a great
degree of freedom in terms of choice of what hardware and software
(including Solid implementations) are installed, operating systems,
firewalls, or any other applications and devices. At the same time, it
also puts the onus of maintenance and responsibility of choosing
technologies on the user as a (self-)provider.</p>
<h4 id="uc-i2-solid-with-iaas">UC-I2: Solid with IaaS</h4>
<p>Subsequent use-cases divulge from <em>UC-I1</em> by increasingly
abstracting the management of resources. <em>U-I2</em> uses the IaaS
cloud paradigm where users provision infrastructure from a provider.
Other than the management of provisioned resources, users retain the
freedom and flexibility of choosing what software they install and use
on their servers. Since the hardware is provisioned as part of IaaS,
users have to abide by the availability and flexibility of chosen
resources in terms of features, compatibility, and management options.
Communications with resources are typically made through APIs defined by
the resource providers. In some cases, a IaaS provider may only support
or allow provisioning resources within its cloud service offerings, or
provide incentives such as lower costs for using the same provider. IaaS
offerings typically also offer complete flexibility in choosing
locations each resource .</p>
<h4 id="uc-i3-solid-as-paas">UC-I3: Solid as PaaS</h4>
<p>Further abstracting the management of resources, utilising the PaaS
cloud paradigm for Solid enables users to request a Pod as a
<em>platform</em> where they receive a pre-configured infrastructure
where details and management of underlying resources such as servers,
data storage disks, etc. are abstracted and hidden. Users may have the
option to provision additional resources or change existing ones based
on supported options. Providers may offer pre-configured choices of
implementations based on Pod specifications, resource quotas (e.g.
storage size), locations, and software (e.g. underlying operating
system). In case of PaaS, users have lesser freedom since direct access
to hardware is restricted and all interactions happen through a
dedicated virtual environment or APIs. However, users get more
convenience since they have to manage less resources.</p>
<h4 id="uc-i4-solid-as-saas">UC-I4: Solid as SaaS</h4>
<p>Applying the SaaS cloud paradigm for Solid mean providing a Pod’s
functionalities in the form of software that the users can access and
manage, e.g. through apps on their devices or through a web browser. In
this case, all the underlying resources (e.g. servers, storage) would be
hidden and managed by the provider. This represents the least amount of
freedom since users would not have any choice in how their Pods are
actually implemented, while also offering the most amount of convenience
as the users get a complete system that is managed and maintained by the
provider. However, it also represents more responsibilities for the
providers in managing the resources, deciding how they should function
together, addressing security, as well as following any specific policy
or legal obligation arising from such decisions.</p>
<p>The SaaS paradigm also enables capabilities such as Solid
specifications on top of existing products and services, such as that
offered by NextCloud<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>, by Solid the underlying native .
This approach can also be extended beyond SaaS to provide the resulting
solution as PaaS or IaaS offerings. More importantly, if Solid
specifications are constrained only to define how data is stored and
accessed through URLs, along with some requirements on identities of
users and apps, then the SaaS model enables any cloud-based storage
provider (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive) to provide
Solid-compatible solutions through their existing products and services
that are popular and widely utilised.</p>
<h4 id="uc-i5-solid-with-caas">UC-I5: Solid with CaaS</h4>
<p>CaaS in combination with Solid enables the use of other use-cases
with additional resource management for providing computing
functionalities, either in the form of servers or as serverless
computing environments and APIs. This could be for executing processes
associated with users (i.e. self-managed computing) or apps (i.e.
controlled environment for third-party computing). The management of
CaaS itself could be via IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS paradigms, which has
different implications on roles and responsibilities associated in
controlling the execution of processes. CaaS can offer valuable trust
and security accommodations where data does not leave known boundaries
or is always under the complete control of users. In such cases, CaaS
can be an additional cloud-based service provisioned by providers or
brokers that can be mutually used by users and apps.</p>
<h4 id="uc-i6-solid-with-staas-or-daas">UC-I6: Solid with STaaS or
DaaS</h4>
<p>data within Solid contain value through additional operations or
interpretations, rather than apps asking for the entirety of (raw) data
and then processing it, Solid use STaaS or DaaS paradigms where apps
request specific information retrieval methods (e.g. SQL queries) or
answers (e.g. via semantic reasoning) to be derived from data and
provided in lieu of sharing data itself. This can be a more
privacy-considerate model where apps never receive the actual data. The
availability of information retrieval and question-answering mechanisms
can be implemented as any of the other cloud paradigms (IaaS, PaaS,
SaaS), with varying degrees of control possible on whether the users can
control what data and features are exposed to apps.</p>
<p>The STaaS and DaaS functionalities also enable third-parties to
provide additional services on top of Pod implementations by acting as
information brokers between the users and the apps. For example, a
STaaS/DaaS service provider can provide an API to calculate fitness
metrics by retrieving from a Pod, operating on it, and returning the
derived information to an app. Separately, the STaaS/DaaS service can
also be executed locally (i.e. within the Pod) through CaaS
capabilities.</p>
<h3 id="sec:uc-apps">Use-Cases based on App Management</h3>
<p>These use-cases are based on different methods by which applications
can be managed in relation to a Pod, where their processes are executed,
and how they are governed in terms of trust and security mechanisms.</p>
<h4 id="uc-a1-apps-are-unmanaged">UC-A1: Apps are Unmanaged</h4>
<p>This use-case reflects the scenarios where any app can be used by the
user without any checks and balances in place regarding their origin,
conformance, or any form of control. It reflects the current situation
in Solid where there are no mechanisms in place that require an app to
declare necessary information (e.g. app provider, policies, legal
compliance information) and which are checked before allowing the app to
access data. Note that this refers to additional requirements as
distinct from conformance to the Solid specifications .</p>
<h4 id="uc-a2-apps-follow-conformance-protocols">UC-A2: Apps follow
Conformance Protocols</h4>
<p>This use-case adds requirements for apps in terms of how they should
express conformance towards specific protocols, specifications,
standards, or legal obligations, and which can be assessed or verified
to ensure trust and accountability. A simple example of such conformance
is the current practices regarding smartphone app stores that require
applications to be packaged with specific metadata, which is checked
before ‘installing’ it on a smartphone. In the case of Solid, since apps
are not installed but rather ‘registered’, the same process can be
performed as part of the registration. The criteria and conditions for
conformance can be based on requirements derived from organisational
policies, user or community guidelines, legal requirements, or other
sources.</p>
<h4 id="uc-a3-apps-are-managed-through-app-stores">UC-A3: Apps are
managed through App Stores</h4>
<p>App Stores or Marketplaces are mechanisms for digital distribution of
software, and are a widely utilised service across devices and
platforms. This also includes package and code repositories, and
distribution of pre-compiled binaries, code that is then compiled on
device, and virtualised applications which are provisioned via cloud
services. App stores enable convenience for both providers and consumers
by providing a common interface which can also provide features such as
search, curation, recommendation, updates, versions, dependencies,
configurations, security notifications, and installation management. App
stores can be established as commercial enterprises (e.g. Apple,
Google), or be community maintained efforts (e.g. Linux package
repositories), and can have dedicated tools and services associated with
app installation, verification, and updates.</p>
<p>App stores may or may not have policies for applications to satisfy
in order to be listed and provided to users. For example, Linux
distributions such as Arch have separate repositories for packages that
undergo some level of oversight by repository maintainers (i.e. official
repositories) and those that do not (i.e. Arch User Repository<a
href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>. In addition to these, app stores
also require specific mechanisms to be in place to verify applications
in terms of security and tampering. Apple’s and Google’s smartphone app
stores also feature oversight bodies that audit applications and remove
applications that do not conform to policies or are found to have
violated terms.</p>
<p>Solid currently does not have an App store, but does maintain a
curated list of apps<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>. NextCloud’s implementation of
Solid as an additional layer on top of its own services also provides
some extent currently unknown) for usability of apps developed for
NextCloud<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>.</p>
<h4 id="uc-a4-apps-are-vetted-or-certified">UC-A4: Apps are Vetted or
Certified</h4>
<p>Vetting or certification is the process by which an app is audited or
assessed and provided a demonstrable and verifiable certificate or seal
that it can produce as a trust mechanism. Certification criteria can be
based on standards - such as use of ISO certification agencies,
established codes and guidelines, and legal compliance requirements -
such as GDPR’s use of certifications and seals as a measure of
demonstrating compliance conformity.</p>
<p>Certification processes are common in the provisioning of software,
where developers sign their created applications, and which are in turn
verified by execution environments before permitting users to install or
use them. Such mechanisms have also been integrated into app stores as
part of security measures. In the case of Solid specifications,
currently apps only have to have a verifiable identity attached to the
(web) domain address under which they operate. An extreme form of
certification is the use of legally enforceable agreements on what the
app is permitted or restricted to do, which is the mechanism used by the
Data Utility Company in the Flanders use-case <span class="citation"
data-cites="FlemishDataUtility"><a href="#ref-FlemishDataUtility"
role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a></span>.</p>
<h4 id="uc-a6-apps-are-installed-locally-in-a-pod">UC-A6: Apps are
installed ‘locally’ in a Pod</h4>
<p>Tangential to how apps are provisioned is the question of how apps
interact with data in the Pod. Solid’s specification consider only cases
where the app requests use of data through URLs. However, following the
CaaS paradigm, it is also possible for apps to be provided as entire or
partial code bundles that can be installed within a locally controlled
environment such as the Pod or associated server. This is akin to
installing software on a device managed by the user. In such cases, the
executions may all or partially take place within the local environment,
with external communications for sending/receiving data and instructions
as alternate mechanisms. The execution environment and control retained
by apps are important considerations for investigating
responsibilities.</p>
<h4 id="uc-a7-apps-install-service-within-a-pod">UC-A7: Apps install
‘service’ within a Pod</h4>
<p>Similar to how apps can be local executions in respect to a Pod, apps
can also install or provide ‘services’ which are installed or executed
locally within a Pod. The term <em>service</em> here refers to the
architectural concept where a process is executed in the ‘background’
such that its execution happens without an active front-end or interface
for the user. Examples of such services include those used for sync,
updates, information retrieval, and managing protocol handling (e.g.
communications). A service can also be an isolated installation separate
from apps. For example, users may choose to only install services that
operate as part of their pods without the corresponding necessity for
them to be expressed as ‘apps’. Solid currently does not specify or
allude to the use of such services, but their prevalence and use in
other devices and platforms represents a possibility for them to be
provided as part of implementations.</p>
<h4 id="uc-a-apps-create-a-locked-ecosystem">UC-A: Apps create a locked
ecosystem</h4>
<p>This use-case represents limitations or restrictions for only
specific apps to be allowed to be used or installed for a given Pod.
This is different from the use of an App store where any app that
satisfies the criteria for inclusion can be used, and instead represents
the case where a Pod provider specifies apps that can be used. Users
have no choice but to use only these apps, and nothing else can be used
without the Provider’s support. Such measures can be enacted for
purposes of ensuring rigid security, controlling data use, or to lock
users into the Provider’s ecosystem. Currently, Solid places no such
restrictions.</p>
<h3 id="sec:uc-restrictions">Use-cases based on Extensions and
Restrictions to Solid’s Functionalities</h3>
<p>These use-cases represent additional extensions or restrictions that
deviate from the current Solid specifications. These are mentioned as
they impact how Solid Pods function, are provisioned, their portability
and interoperability, and have important considerations on
responsibilities of both providers and users, especially under GDPR.</p>
<h4 id="uc-l1-limitations-on-data-andor-apps">UC-L1: Limitations on Data
and/or Apps</h4>
<p>A Pod or App provider may place limits on data or apps whereby the
user cannot exercise control in terms of editing or deleting it. For
example, a Pod provider may provision the pod with some pre-configured
apps that the user cannot remove may have the option of adding and
managing other additional data and apps. An extreme extension of this
concept is the case where all data within the Pod is not within the
user’s control, and where the Pod is effectively a storage solution.
Less severe iterations are also possible, such as only allowing certain
types of data to be stored in the Pod, or for the data to only be shared
with certain apps.</p>
<h4 id="uc-l2-shared-pods-with-multiple-users">UC-L2: Shared Pods with
Multiple Users</h4>
<p>A Pod may have multiple users with or without separation of data
amongst themselves. This is akin to multiple users using the same
terminal or computer with separate accounts, who may be able to view,
use, or control each others dedicated data, and may have common
locations for shared data. Such separations can reflect private groups
such as families or organisational environments such as departments and
teams. The sharing of a Pod has important considerations in terms of
responsibilities, security, and the necessary software support required.
Currently, Solid does support multiple users to access data within a Pod
with varying degrees of control, but only supports a single user to be
associated with the Pod in terms of its identity.</p>
<h4 id="uc-l3-pod-where-user-is-not-a-data-subject">UC-L3: Pod where
User is not a Data Subject</h4>
<p>This use-case considers Solid Pods where the user is not the Data
Subject i.e. the data within the Pod is about an individual other than
the user. This could be where the user is permitted to manage such data
(e.g. as a parent or guardian or legal representative), or where Pods
are used as dedicated storage areas for an individual’s data and the
users are part of the organisation for managing it. In such cases, the
user deciding who accesses the data has implications for the data
subject, which means the users also share responsibilities depending on
the specifics of their role and relationship with the data subject.</p>
<h4 id="uc-l4-virtualisation-of-pods">UC-L4: Virtualisation of Pods</h4>
<p>A Solid Pod is presumed to be a single holistic resource. However, it
is feasible for a Pod to be implemented as a virtualisation over several
resources or even Pods that are hidden from external view and are used
to separate and manage data and relevant concerns. The inverse of this
is also feasible - where separate Solid Pods are in actuality the same
underlying resource with virtual separation to represent data of
different users. Such patterns require support from various
implementation layers, and may entail obligations for the entities
deciding how such separations should be implemented and managed. For
example, if Pods are implemented on a single storage infrastructure with
separation managed virtually through software, then a valid security
concern is whether accessing one user’s data can accidentally retrieve
another user’s data.</p>

<h3 id="lawfulness-fairness-transparency">Lawfulness, Fairness,
Transparency</h3>
<p>GDPR Art.5-1a stipulates that all processing must be “processed
lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner”. The principle of
<em>Lawfulness</em> refers to the necessity for any and all data
processing to be justified through the use of one or more of the 6
lawful or legal basis defined by Art.6. These contain amongst others -
consent (Art.6-1a), contract (Art.6-1b), legal obligation (Art.6-1c),
and legitimate interests (Art.6-1f). In addition to these, certain
contexts have separate legal basis which must be utilised, such as
special categories of personal data requiring Art.9 legal basis, and
cross-border data transfers requiring Art.45, Art.46, or Art.49. In
addition to these, the principle of lawfulness also requires the
processing to be lawful with other legal requirements outside of the
GDPR.</p>
<p>The choice of which legal basis to use is dependant on the intended
purposes, processing operations, personal data categories, as well as
their necessity and importance. While the GDPR does not specify any
particular order or preference for one legal basis over another, an
incorrect application can result in compliance violation. The most
common legal bases in use are related to contract (e.g. service
provision), legitimate interest (e.g. fraud prevention), and consent
(e.g. opt-in marketing).</p>
<p>Another point of note is that under GDPR, each (singular or joint)
Data Controller must have its own separate and independent legal basis,
i.e. if there are two Data Controllers with separation of purposes and
concerns, and both require consent, they must collect such consent
separately. Such conditions for the <em>validity</em> of consent are
noted in Art.7, Rec.32, Rec.33, and Rec.43, along with the necessity to
maintain records in Art.7 and Rec.42.</p>
<p>In Solid, while there is a record access granted to an app for
specific data, it is not sufficient to meet GDPR’s requirements for
either valid consent or a valid record of consent. For example, Solid’s
mechanisms and records do not specify who the Data Controller is, the
purposes for use of that data, the categories of data (especially for
special categories), and if there are other legal bases also associated
with that data.</p>
<p>Solid defines the concept <em>Access Needs</em> as “a specific
explanation of why that data type is being requested” <span
class="citation" data-cites="SolidApplicationInteroperability"><a
href="#ref-SolidApplicationInteroperability"
role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></span>, which can be considered analogous
to a purpose. However, the use of terms <em>access</em> and
<em>needs</em> imply specific contextual connotations that may be
interpreted ambiguously and in a manner not compatible with the use of
<em>purpose</em> in data protection and privacy laws. For example,
<em>access</em> can refer only to the initial access to data - which is
only one type of possible operation and does not cover subsequent uses
and sharing. Similarly, <em>needs</em> implies some notion of necessity
which may be misleading in cases where the data is <em>optional</em> or
<em>not strictly necessary</em> to fulfil a purpose but is useful to
enhance it.</p>
<p>In order to be compliant with the GDPR, it is vital for a Data
Controller to declare their legal basis, and to indicate this clearly to
the data subjects. In the case of Solid, there is no corresponding
concept or method by which an app can indicate the legal basis for how
it uses the data. Since the model for data access is based on asking
permission from the user, this may be misconstrued as being only based
on consent, but in actuality may be accompanied by other legal basis -
such as contracts and legitimate interests. As a consequence, Solid also
does not feature or support recording the legal basis as part of
establishing the access control authorisation from an app request, nor
to record subsequent accesses to the data being performed using specific
legal bases.</p>
<p>An important point to consider in terms of behaviour is that
organisations may share data with third-party organisations based on
(assessed and validated) the third party’s legitimate interests or as
part of a legal obligation (e.g. Banks and Know-Your-Customer). In the
case of Solid, because the data is stored on a Pod and managed by a user
- the responsibility of handling such requests also falls on the users.
This represents an unexplored area of GDPR, such as for deciding what
are the legal options for when Solid Pod users receive a request to
access data but with the legal basis as legitimate interest or legal
obligation instead of consent or contract. The answer may be simpler in
cases where users are also data subjects, since this means they can
exercise the right to object (Art.21) for legitimate interests, while
handling legal obligation requests can be challenging regarding
establishing the validity of such requests.</p>
<p>Fairness refers to the necessity for processing to be in line with
reasonable expectations of data subjects and which does not have
unjustified adverse effects on them. This principle provides data
subjects with some degree of protection from being exploited,
manipulated, or otherwise have detrimental impacts arising from the
processing of their personal data. In order to assess fairness,
considerations include specific justifications presented for collection
and use of data, their comprehension by individuals and groups affected,
whether there is discrimination, and if there are detriments or
obstacles for individuals to exercise their rights.</p>
<p>Transparency, also related to fairness, refers to the availability
and comprehensibility of information regarding processing of data (e.g.
what, why, where, how, who) - which is typically associated with a
<em>privacy notice</em> (or privacy policies). Such notices may be
presented to individuals as part of their contract (e.g. terms and
conditions), or in the consenting dialogue. GDPR necessitates provision
of such notices for transparency in cases where data is collected
(Art.13) as well as not collected (Art.14) from the data subject.</p>
<p>Solid does not support nor require apps to use or provide information
via notices when making requests, except the ill-defined Access Needs
descriptions. This means apps must use external mechanisms to provide
such notices, such as through their websites or other interfaces, and
the details and specifics of which are not accessible nor recorded to
the users. While an app’s metadata can contain a link to the policy that
contain this information, Solid does not mandate it to be present,
resolvable, or assist in ensuring this information is available and
accessible to users. In addition, the lack of acknowledgement of how
further processing of data beyond initial access should be indicated or
recorded as part of the data requests also compounds the detrimental
impact. This results in difficulties for assessing the transparency of
data processing operations.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-limitation">Purpose Limitation</h3>
<p>GDPR’s Art.5-1b data be “collected for specified, explicit and
legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is
incompatible with those purposes”. This necessitates all data requests
to be associated with a purpose that not only covers the initial
justification, but also any subsequent additional uses of that data. The
resulting obligation requires Data Controllers to inform about specific
purposes, typically through notices, and places constraints on what is
considered a ‘valid purpose’ based on its clarity, comprehensibility,
and specificity.</p>
<p>The association between purposes and legal bases requires the use of
a specific legal basis to cover all possible purposes and uses of data,
which is at odds with Solid’s focus on only considering data operations
within the context of a Pod. For example, if a service provider requests
access to data for the purposes of providing a specific service with the
lawful basis as contract, it cannot subsequently collect and use that
data (externally outside the Pod) to also perform other activities that
are incompatible with the initial purpose. In such cases, the service
provider is required to ask for consent (or choose another appropriate
legal basis).</p>
<p>In order to assess whether purposes are valid, and whether they are
being correctly used as required by GDPR, a Data Controller is obliged
to keep a Record of Processing Activities (ROPA, Art. 30). In addition,
purposes also have to be made available to data subjects - typically
through privacy notices. In case of Solid, while there are no specific
obligations to keep a record of such purposes within the Pod, the
existing use of Access Needs and their groupings is similar to the use
of purposes and purpose limitation principle.</p>
<h3 id="data-minimisation">Data Minimisation</h3>
<p>GDPR’s Art.5-1c specifies the data minimisation principle, which
requires data to be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary
in relation to the purposes for which they are processed”. Along with
the lawfulness and purpose limitation principles, the data minimisation
principle also requires data to be specifically and explicitly declared
and be associated with purposes. Through these, assessment of adequacy
and relevancy are to be made based on whether the Data Controller is
using the ‘minimum amount’ of data to fulfil a purpose or is engaging in
(unlawful) excessive collection of data that is not justified, nor
required, or is based on future presumptions of usefulness. For Solid,
first there requires to be explicit acknowledgement of what data
categories are being processed in relation to which purposes (or as
currently used - Access Needs). Only then it can be assessed whether the
data being processed is adequate, relevant, and necessary for the
indicated purpose. As outlined earlier, the data processing operations
include those that occur within a Pod as well as external to it - which
is not currently supported by Solid’s specifications.</p>
<h3 id="accuracy">Accuracy</h3>
<p>The principle of accuracy in Art.5-1d requires Data Controllers to
ensure data is “accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date”. Through
Solid Pods, in theory, data subjects having () access to their own data
also gain the ability to rectify any inaccuracies or deficiencies
themselves. However, in practice this may be difficult in cases where
data is obfuscated or not comprehensible by data subjects, or through
lack of relevant tools, or because modifying such data may affect its
integrity and validity for subsequent use (e.g. in official documents).
In such cases, the ability for data subjects to exercise their right to
rectify information (Art.16) can be facilitated by providing a
communication mechanism which uses the Pod to store and share the
rectified information with the Data Controller as well as any other
parties (Art.19). Note that under GDPR, a Data Controller is obliged to
accept a data subject’s changes to their data, which effectively makes
the data within a Solid Pod that is under control of the data subject an
authoritative representation of their data.</p>
<h3 id="storage-limitation">Storage Limitation</h3>
<p>GDPR’s Art.5-1e stipulates personal data be “kept in a form which
permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary
for the purposes for which the personal data are processed;”. This
reflects the conventional interpretation where data is collected and
retained by the Data Controller, which needs to be re-interpreted for
Solid’s decentralised paradigm. First, the storage limitation principle
emphasises the necessity to associate specific categories of data being
processed with the purposes of processing. Second, it refers to the
storage duration for data, which in context of Solid can be interpreted
as both duration of access to data in a Pod as well as storage duration
of data retained external to the Pod.</p>
<p>Currently, the Solid specifications do not support expressing
duration associated with data access authorisations, which means apps
have access to data in perpetuity until access is revoked. This also
reflects deviation from ‘good practice’ guidelines regarding consent
<span class="citation" data-cites="Guidelines0520202020"><a
href="#ref-Guidelines0520202020" role="doc-biblioref">[38]</a></span>
which suggests limiting the duration of consent and/or re-affirming it
periodically. While Solid specifications provide a way to record the
timestamp associated with authorisations, they do not have necessary
mechanisms in place to evaluate this periodically - as required for
storage limitation and consent ‘refresh’ requirements. An important
consideration for cases where data is not under the control of the user,
such as that outlined in <em>UC-L1</em>, is that the storage limitation
principle applies in full as per existing conventions to the entity that
has control of this data.</p>
<p>In addition, while the use of <em>identification</em> in the storage
limitation principle does allow such data to retained after being made
anonymous - it represents a exceedingly high-bar since under GDPR the
criteria for anonymity cannot be satisfied by merely stripping
identifiers <span class="citation" data-cites="finckTheyWhoMust2020"><a
href="#ref-finckTheyWhoMust2020" role="doc-biblioref">[39]</a></span>.
In order to indicate this information, it is necessary to express both
duration of storage and the processing operation that will be applied
after this period, i.e. deletion or anonymisation. Where the storage
limitation principle is instead implemented by limiting access control,
the scope for continued use of data through anonymisation may not be
possible without the Pod and/or users permission and support. Of note,
merely storing the anonymised data within a Pod that is or can be
associated with a data subject has a strong possibility for the data to
be considered <em>identifiable</em>, and thus become non-anonymised
personal data again, even if the app does not use this identification
information.</p>
<h3 id="integrity-and-confidentiality">Integrity and
Confidentiality</h3>
<p>GDPR’s Art.5-1e states the principle of integrity and confidentiality
that requires data to be “processed in a manner that ensures appropriate
security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised
or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or
damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures”. This
means Data Controllers and Processors who process personal data
(including collection and storage) should ensure appropriate technical
(e.g. encryption, access control) and organisational (e.g. training,
codes of conduct) measures are utilised based on specifics of processing
operations, data categories involved, and other contextual information
(Art.32, Rec.78, Rec.83). This includes performing appropriate risk
assessment and implementing risk management and mitigation processes in
a systematic manner integrated with the processing (Art.32, Rec.75,
Rec.76. Rec.77). The use of ‘security measures’ is a shortened common
for referring to both technical and organisational measures under GDPR
based on their intention to protect and safeguard data impacts in the
broadest sense.</p>
<p>While the implementation of measures related to security are
typically the responsibility of a Data Controller, for Solid this
changes based on who controls the implementation of Pods, resources,
data management, and apps the case the storage is managed by the user.
For example, if the user provisions a Pod using SaaS, they have no
control over the underlying infrastructure, whereas if they provision it
using IaaS, then they control the implementation resources. The
integrity and confidentiality principle is important given that it
affects aspects such as backup, integrity controls, protection against
attacks (e.g. hacking, DDoS), data breaches, maintaining logs, ensuring
effectiveness for access control, etc. It is also important for
considerations related to risk management and impact assessments
(Art.32, Art.35, Rec.75, Rec.84, Rec.90–93).</p>
<p>One important consideration for Solid is that the GDPR requires Data
Controllers to make informed assessments of a Processor’s security
measures before engaging them. Depending on who implements and controls
what within a Solid-based use-case, the various responsibilities may
need to be carefully considered and established to ensure appropriate
safeguards are in place and ensure their legal relevance and compliance.
While there are existing guidelines in place regarding implementations
for resources (e.g. hardware, software), the new considerations relate
to whether users will have the responsibilities to assess such measures
for Pod and resource providers based on existing common practices for
provisioning cloud services - especially in IaaS paradigms<a
href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>.</p>
<h3 id="accountability">Accountability</h3>
<p>The last principle mentioned is accountability (Art.5-2), which
states - “The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to
demonstrate compliance” with the other principles. Depending on the role
(Controller or Processor), the accountability principle requires
planning and operational management along with documentation of specific
obligations from GDPR. For example, implementing policies for ‘data
protection by design and default’ (Art.25), appropriate contractual
measures between Controllers and Processors (Art.29), ROPA records
(Art.30), handling data breaches (Art.33, Art.34), Data Protection
Impact Assessment (DPIA, Art.35), appointing a Data Protection Officer
(Art.37–39), and utilising appropriate codes of conducts and
certifications (Art.40–42). These obligations are required to be
maintained and re-evaluated on an ongoing basis, and are typically
integrated into an organisation’s management frameworks and policies.
The records kept as part of these processes (e.g. ROPA) are utilised as
the first avenues for inspections and audits into compliance
practices.</p>
<p>The Solid specifications provide rudimentary measures for supporting
such records through registries of access requests, but which do not
satisfy the full extent of requirements required by GDPR (e.g. ROPA
Art.30). This is an important deficiency in cases where the user (or
provider) has to maintain records associated with (other) resource
providers and apps, either because they are the Controllers in such
relationships or to audit and ensure accountability of other entities.
Since the current state of specifications do not provide any avenue for
even establishing who the other entities are (i.e. their legal
identities and applicable jurisdictions), their legal compliance
investigations face a steep setback. In the ideal case the required
information is recorded, or available through accessible links (e.g.
app’s metadata). However, if this is not the case, and there is some
mischief or malice being conducted, there is little potential for
resolving this since authorities may have to conduct lengthy
investigations to even establish the entities and their roles within a
use-case. Pragmatism therefore necessitates such identities and
relationships be established and recorded upfront to ensure appropriate
levels of accountability are maintained.</p>
<h3 id="controllers-and-processors">Controllers and Processors</h3>
<p>GDPR Art.4 defines a controller as the entity that “alone or jointly
with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of
personal data”, and a processor as the entity that “processes personal
data on behalf of the controller”. Identifying who the controller(s) are
in a given use-case is an essential task towards establishing who has
the responsibility to fulfil GDPR’s various obligations. For this, as
per the definitions, the <em>determination</em> of a purpose i.e. who
decided what purposes should the data be processed for, and the
<em>means</em> for carrying out that processing i.e. how it should be
implemented.</p>
<p>The nuance between a controller and processor is an important one
given the implications of additional obligations that come with being a
controller. In most cases, even where a processor seems to be specifying
the means for how processing takes place (e.g. use of a specific ), it
is essential to clarify that such operational decisions are permitted
for a processor as long as limit their processing to what has been
agreed in the contract with the controller <span class="citation"
data-cites="EDPSGuidelinesConcepts2019"><a
href="#ref-EDPSGuidelinesConcepts2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[31]</a></span>. Therefore, merely determining the
technological implementation of processing not sufficient to become a
controller if such implementations are backed by appropriate contractual
terms, and where the processor is not the one that determines what data
should be processed, its purposes, legal basis, etc. - which are to be
decided by a controller.</p>
<p>Typically under GDPR the controller is the entity that decides what
data should be collected, maintains it, and operates on it for some
purposes. In Solid, it is tempting to assume that because the user has
control over how their data is stored and the ability to manage its
access for external entities (as apps), they automatically become
full-fledged controllers under the GDPR <span class="citation"
data-cites="EDPSGuidelinesConcepts2019"><a
href="#ref-EDPSGuidelinesConcepts2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[31]</a></span>. However, in this there are several
important considerations and complications that require careful legal
analysis and investigations to establish the exact responsibilities of
the users as well as to avoid unnecessary burdens on individuals from a
presumption of controllership.</p>
<p>Further, GDPR Art.2 and Rec.18 specify exemptions for processing
undertaken by individuals as a “purely personal or household activity
and thus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity”.
This means that a user maintaining their own data for personal reasons
is exempt from GDPR’s obligations, but only to the extent that such as
activities are considered private. Existing case law <span
class="citation"
data-cites="edwardsDataSubjectsData2019 janssenPersonalInformationManagement2020 janssenDecentralizedDataProcessing2021"><a
href="#ref-edwardsDataSubjectsData2019" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a>–<a
href="#ref-janssenDecentralizedDataProcessing2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span> establishes that where such
boundaries are crossed, e.g. by making data public or undertaking
activities for commercial reasons (e.g. running a business), the
exemption cannot be valid and the user is considered a controller for
processing of their own data.</p>
<p>In Solid, the determination of who is the controller therefore is
based on what entity determines how data should be used and how it
should be processed.</p>
<p>Where users control the implementation of pods and resources, they
determine the means of storage (as a processing operation) - therefore
they should be considered as controllers for the purposes of storing
their information. Similarly, when users do not control the Pod
infrastructure and do not have access to the underlying implementations,
they should not be considered as controllers - but instead the Pod and
resource providers who retain control should be specified as
controllers. In this, we presume that Pod users are the data subjects,
because if they are not, then based on their relationship to the data
subject (e.g. parents) they may end up being (joint-)controllers
irrespective of the control over underlying infrastructure.</p>
<p>The issue of Pod-based controllers is entirely separate from the use
of data by apps, which will have their own separate considerations for
determining controller. Even if users (as data subjects) retain the
ability to dictate which apps are permitted to access the data, and have
control so as to revoke such access at any time - this cannot be
sufficient for specifying them as controllers. This is because the
determination of purpose would typically be done by the apps, with the
users merely acting to provide the required data. In cases where the
users are involved in also specifying the purpose and/or how it should
be implemented - such as with the CaaS paradigm in UC-Ix, the decision
of who are controllers is based on degree of control the users and apps
have in deciding what should be done as well as who/where it is
implemented.</p>
<p>Where users (as data subjects) are deemed to be controllers, the
exact implications of such a role are ill-defined due to the presumption
of GDPR as well as its associated guidelines that the controller is an
organisation. For example, it is entirely unfeasible for data subjects
to be tasked with maintaining ROPA or records of their own consent, and
it is outright nonsensical to imply that they should serve themselves
with notices for transparency and accountability obligations. Therefore,
where data subjects do become controllers, it should be taken as an
indication of pointing out who is responsible for specific aspects of a
processing operations, such as determination of storage or computation
environments. This is no different than placing the responsibility of
leaving a hotel room’s door unlocked to the person using a hotel
room.</p>
<p>While the arguments laid here regarding controllers are simplistic
and lack any in-depth legal investigation, the intention is to prove
sufficiently that investigations of determining controllers within
Solid-based use-cases is a complex topic that warrants further research
and investigations. In particular, to avoid excessive burdens on data
subjects in managing their own data, and to offer a clear path forward
by using the identified use-cases to determine who should be the
controllers and processors.</p>
<h3 id="exercising-rights">Exercising Rights</h3>
<p>GDPR Art.12–22 provide information on several rights that a
controller has to make available to the data subject. These relate to
transparency regarding processing actors and specifics (Art.13, Art.14),
providing access to data (Art.15, Art.20), rectification (Art.16) and
erasure (Art.17) of data, restriction (Art.18) and objection (Art.21) to
processing, and to not be subjected to automated decision making
(Art.22). Of these, the rights related to providing access to data and
data portability can be readily implemented using Solid since the Pod
already stores the data. Other rights that relate to rectification and
erasure can also be readily implemented by modifying the appropriate
data within a Pod.</p>
<p>Exercising the rights related to information provision requires such
information to be record and accessible, which is currently not possible
using Solid. For example, Solid specifications do not support indicating
the source of data (e.g. user or third-party), or the identities of apps
that collect this information, categories of data, who the data will be
shared with, and several other key pieces of information required for
the transparency obligation and typically covered by privacy notices.
Similarly, exercising the rights related to restriction of processing,
or objection to legitimate interests, or objecting to automated decision
making also require corresponding support from Solid
implementations.</p>
<p>While it is always possible to provide information and exercise these
rights outside of the Pod, e.g. on an app’s website, these rights are
closely tied to the access to data within a Pod. For example, when the
user exercises their right to restrict processing based on perceived
unlawfulness of an app, this can be the equivalent of revoking any
access to data even if there were other legitimate and lawful uses of
that data by the same app. Without communicating such decisions (i.e.
access revocation happened because a right has been exercised), the app
(or more importantly the app’s controller) may not be able to
distinguish between revocation of consent and exercising of rights
related to objection or restriction.</p>
<h3 id="cross-border-data-transfers">Cross-border Data Transfers</h3>
<p>GDPR operates under the EU regimes where territorial scope is
established for the free-flow of data within the EU. Any data transfer
outside of these jurisdictions (called ‘third countries’) requires a
corresponding legal basis from Art.45 (adequacy decision), Art.46 (data
transfer safeguards), or in their absence the use of explicit consent,
contract, or other legal bases as per Art.49. To assist with the
determination of whether these obligations apply, it is essential to
identify and record the locations associated with data processing –
including storage, computation, and communication.</p>
<p>In Solid, a Pod represents a storage resource stored at one or more
locations, and which are accessed by apps. Depending on whether the Pod
or app’s resources involve locations outside the EU, and do not utilise
any of the Art.45, Art.46, and Art.49 provisions, the resulting
situation can be problematic with severe impacts to the ability of users
to initiate an enforceable complaint (e.g. a non-EU based entity) and to
exercise their rights (e.g. entites do not support EU rights). Such
determinations require information about locations associated with the
controllers and processors associated with the Pod, resources, and apps
– which are currently not supported by the Solid specifications.</p>
<h3 id="handling-data-breaches">Handling Data Breaches</h3>
<p>GDPR Art.4-12 defines a data breach as “a breach of security leading
to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration,
unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted,
stored or otherwise processed”. The EDPB’s guidelines on data breaches
outline breaches to have one or more of the following categories based
on whether there is an unauthorised or accidental action on data
regarding: (1) confidentiality - disclosure or access; (2) integrity -
alteration; and (3) availability - loss of access or destruction. GDPR
Art.33 and Art.34 specify obligations for a controllers and processors
to notify data breaches to the relevant controllers, authorities, or
data subjects without undue delay, along with information about the
extent of breach in terms of affected data categories, consequences, and
mitigation measures being undertaken.</p>
<p>In the case of Solid Pods, a breach can happen at the underlying
storage resource, the software environment hosting the Pod (e.g.
operating system, web server), the processes associated with
implementing a Pod feature (e.g. database), or through access granted to
users and apps. This can be for resources managed by users (e.g. IaaS,
CaaS) or without awareness to the users (e.g Saas). In cases where the
Pod is managed by a provider, with the user not having control over the
implementations, the handling of data breaches is the responsibility of
the resource providers. However, where the user manages their own
infrastructure and software implementing a Pod, the responsibility of
handling data breaches also rests with them.</p>
<p>It is important to note the distinction between GDPR’s notion of
responsibility and that of liability. Under GDPR, a responsibility means
the duty to carry out an activity, such as to notify the authorities
when a data breach takes place. By contrast, a liability is a typically
pecuniary obligation that seeks to determine who is at fault. The
handling of data breaches also includes ensuring appropriate technical
and organisational measures are in place to avoid such breaches taking
place, to minimise their consequences should they take place, and to
have plans for addressing their impacts for when they do take place.</p>
<p>For users implementing their own Pods (e.g. IaaS), this may mean
additional duties for ensuring the appropriate security measures are in
place, and to carefully assess all of their software’s known
vulnerabilities. While this may seem burdensome, this is no different
than managing a personal server. Except that in the case of Solid, new
attack surfaces emerge, such as cases where an app or malicious actor is
provided access to all data on a Pod – through technical bugs, system
vulnerabilities, or by convincing the user via social engineering and
phishing attacks. Current Solid specifications have indicated some
awareness of technical risks associated with breaches and security in
general, but lack similar addressing of personal and social risks that
lead to data breaches.</p>

<p>In the case of Solid, first, there is no consistent or clear method
for how users should be provided with this information. Apps are
supposed to have a profile that may contain a link to their policy, but
there is no acknowledgement of what such policies should feature or how
these relate to legal obligations. Combined with a lack of record on who
is the actual legally-accountable entity accessing their data , users
are completely at the mercy of an potentially unknown entities with no
transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>Where apps need to request access to data, it is unclear as to the
necessity of providing information as a precursor to make the decision.
This is a vital requirement where the basis for such data requests is
consent - which Solid specifications also do not elaborate upon. The
result is a vague guidance on apps being required to ask
<em>permission</em> to use data without any oversight on how that
permission is sought or its validity in being considered <em>informed
consent</em>. Even if such information were provided to the users via a
website or other document in full compliance with the law, the Solid
specifications do not acknowledge or provide support for users to be
provided with this information in a manner that does not repeat the
existing issues of information overlead. Solid also does not record
relevant information pertaining to such informed decisions, such as the
location of where the user expressed their consent (e.g. a website), or
links to privacy notices, or receipts <span class="citation"
data-cites="jesusConsentReceiptsUsable2022"><a

later.</p>
<h3 id="manipulative-and-deceptive-practices-in-consenting">Manipulative
and Deceptive Practices in Consenting</h3>
<p>Further to issues regarding transparency and comprehension of
information, the existing issues related to consenting being invalid,
unfair, or outright deceptive also apply to Solid. For example, by
keeping control of data with users, but control of the requesting
mechanism with apps, the determination of what should be present in
requests and choices offered to users is entirely controlled by external
entities (e.g. app providers). This effectively has potential for
existing wide-spread issues that take advantage of power imbalance with
users to exploit them via various means – all stemming from control of
consenting mechanisms. Well-studied, wide-spread, and demonstrably
illegal examples of such practices are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Dark Patterns:</strong> using UI/UX design to nudge,
coerce, and manipulate users <span class="citation"
data-cites="tothDarkPatternsManipulation2022 santosAreCookieBanners2020"><a
href="#ref-tothDarkPatternsManipulation2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[46]</a>, <a href="#ref-santosAreCookieBanners2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[47]</a></span>, e.g. clicking ‘Accept All’ because
other options are hidden and require time to exercise or configure, or
using pre-configured choices, or nagging when consent is
refused.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consent Walls:</strong> witholding features and services
until users give consent to excessive data use and sharing <span
class="citation" data-cites="santosAreCookieBanners2020"><a
href="#ref-santosAreCookieBanners2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[47]</a></span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hiding Impact and Extent:</strong> using UI/UX design
along with user’s lack of domain knowledge to hide the true extent and
impact of consent – such as where accepting will result in sharing of
data and profiling by thousands of companies <span class="citation"

role="doc-biblioref">[47]</a></span>, or that it involves sensitive or
special data categories.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assumption of Consent:</strong> where consent is either
entirely assumed (i.e. users are not even asked), or where the choices
made by the users differ from what the controller records as consent
(e.g. controller may record ‘Accept All’ even when users have selected
only some options) <span class="citation"
data-cites="santosAreCookieBanners2020 tothDarkPatternsManipulation2022 vealeImpossibleAsksCan2022"><a

href="#ref-santosAreCookieBanners2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[47]</a></span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="withdrawing-consent">Withdrawing Consent</h3>
<p>Since Pods do not keep records of what the purposes, data, and
context (e.g. duration, frequency) of consent is, or where users can
find this information, users have no means to contact an application or
exercise their rights - such as to withdraw their consent or to ask for
restriction in processing. In this, it is critical to understand that
Solid’s use of <em>access control authorisation</em> cannot be treated
as a fair equivalent of consenting and withdrawal on its own. This is
because of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>access control</em> only governs access to data, therefore
the permission it governs is restricted to access of that data. The
Solid specifications do not mention any requirement to interpret
revocation of access to also restrict further processing of data by an
app.</p></li>
<li><p><em>signalling consent withdrawal</em> – revocation of access can
be for several reasons, for example the user wants to stop providing
access to that data, or they have identified a problem with an app, or
some associated duration for the access has expired (e.g. access is
valid for 3 months and must be confirmed periodically). By not
distinguishing which of these decisions has resulted in the revocation
of access, both users and apps are unaware of what has happened as well
as what steps must be taken next. Therefore, where the user has decided
to withdraw their consent, this should be a distinct action to enable
the appropriate legal obligations to be triggered.</p></li>
<li><p><em>communicating withdrawal to third parties</em> – users may
give consent to more than just the app when sharing their data. For
example, if the consent allows the app to access data, and to further
share it with others, merely revocation will only be visible to the app.
Since there was no record of what entities are involved in consent, the
users cannot signal these entities itself, nor can they ask the app to
further communicate their withdrawal.</p></li>
<li><p><em>granular withdrawal for some purposes</em> – GDPR requires
consent to be granular in regards of purposes, i.e. separate purposes
must have separate consent, such that consenting and withdrawal can be
managed in isolation for each separate purpose. In the case of Solid,
there is no indication of purpose when accessing data. While separate
Access Needs can be managed using separate identifiers for security,
these concepts do not cover purposes for how the data may be used
external to the pod. So revocation of an access need may be result in
the necessary and corresponding withdrawal to other associated purposes
the user agreed to when granting consent. Further, the specifications do
not clarify the behaviour for when two authorisations govern the same
data and one is revoked.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="legal-basis-ambiguity-and-misuse">Legal Basis: Ambiguity and
Misuse</h3>
<p>GDPR’s legal basis are strictly and rigidly interpreted in terms of
their validity towards justifying processing. For example, it would be
in violation of GDPR if a Solid app uses contract or legitimate interest
where the legal basis should have been consent. In addition, a Solid
app’s requests for consent should be separate from other matters and
requests. This creates a potential for repeating existing problematic
instances where controllers misuse legal basis (e.g. legitimate interest
instead of consent <span class="citation"
data-cites="santosAreCookieBanners2020 mattePurposesIABEurope2020 tothDarkPatternsManipulation2022 vealeImpossibleAsksCan2022"><a
href="#ref-vealeImpossibleAsksCan2022" role="doc-biblioref">[45]</a>–<a
href="#ref-santosAreCookieBanners2020" role="doc-biblioref">[47]</a>, <a
href="#ref-mattePurposesIABEurope2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[49]</a></span>) and where users are not aware of
other uses of data because of the notice for consent also containing
information about other legal bases <span class="citation"
data-cites="santosAreCookieBanners2020"><a
href="#ref-santosAreCookieBanners2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[47]</a></span>. In Solid, since there is no
concept of legal basis or consent, and all access requests are treated
as a singular combined transaction, it is entirely possible for the
consenting request to have specified that the data would be used for
additional purposes through a separate legal basis, and which the users
do not realise or misinterpret because of their understanding that Solid
enables control of data <em>regardless</em> of legal basis.</p>
<h3 id="hidden-actors-exploitation">Hidden Actors Exploitation</h3>
<p>Even where entities across both side, e.g. users and app developers,
are well-behaved, their use of other third-party vendors and services
can be a source of unintended or negligent problems. For example,
websites using a Consent Management Platform (CMP) to manage consent for
their services have shown problematic uses where the CMPs decide what
data is collected and use it for their own purpose <span
class="citation"
data-cites="mattePurposesIABEurope2020 santosAreCookieBanners2020"><a
href="#ref-santosAreCookieBanners2020" role="doc-biblioref">[47]</a>, <a
href="#ref-mattePurposesIABEurope2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[49]</a></span>. While this is manifestly illegal
under GDPR, as seen prolificly for misuses arising from real-time
advertising and IAB’s TCF framework <span class="citation"
data-cites="vealeImpossibleAsksCan2022"><a
href="#ref-vealeImpossibleAsksCan2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[45]</a></span>, users and app developers may not
be aware of such situations until the data has already been accessed and
shared. In Solid, there are no checks and balances in terms of what an
‘app’ actually is in terms of legal entities, or a thorough analysis of
the extent to which its design and mechanisms have issues that enable
third-parties to cause such mischief.</p>
<h3 id="risk-management---data-sensitivity">Risk Management - Data
Sensitivity</h3>
<p>In a Solid Pod, there are no distinctions between data in terms of
origin, sensitivity, legal obligations (e.g. mandatory information), or
association with specific categories (e.g. to say data at a specific URL
is health data). This is a problem because while neither users nor apps
have this information, an app that uses data that is knowingly or
unknowingly sensitive or special category may end up resulting in
security issues or legal compliance violations. Such lack of awareness
regarding data also enables problematic actors to operate in a hidden
manner, for example, hypothetically - if a fitness device was storing
data in a Pod regarding movement logs, an app accessing this data for
the purposes of showing statistics on how active the user is may find
and exploit the location data present in logs in order to surveil and
profile the user and to sell this information to third-parties without
the users knowledge <span class="citation"
data-cites="DataBrokersCall2014 urbanMeasuringImpactGDPR2020"><a
href="#ref-DataBrokersCall2014" role="doc-biblioref">[50]</a>, <a
href="#ref-urbanMeasuringImpactGDPR2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[51]</a></span> – which are illegal under GDPR but
not effectively enforced. The ambiguity on what access to data via a URL
exactly means in terms of data categories further complicates the
situation in the app’s favour as they can claim the user is the
responsible entity to ensure only needed data was transferred and the
Solid specifications do not place any restrictions on access being based
on specific data categories or requiring them to ‘clean’ or ‘filter’
data to ensure no additional information is provided. Combined with
potential misuses from information obfuscation and dark patterns, the
app may be able to further hide its activities and claim the user has
consented to them <span class="citation"
data-cites="vealeImpossibleAsksCan2022"><a
href="#ref-vealeImpossibleAsksCan2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[45]</a></span>.</p>
<p>Not knowing data categories involved and their sensitivity also has
implications for the risk management and mitigation for all entities
involved. If a Pod is provisioned using PaaS or SaaS, then the provider
may be obliged to provide additional appropriate features if the
use-case requires sensitive data (e.g. health data). Without such
knowledge, providers only have to support the bare minimum security and
risk features, and may put the responsibilities and burdens on to users
to manage their own data related risks.</p>
<h3 id="tracking-and-profiling">Tracking and Profiling</h3>
<p>Tracking and profiling are severe problems for web-enabled platforms
and devices as they provide a convenient method for information
exchange. Techniques such as fingerprinting <span class="citation"
data-cites="laperdrixBrowserFingerprintingSurvey2020"><a
href="#ref-laperdrixBrowserFingerprintingSurvey2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[52]</a></span> are commonly used to identify and
individuals, and are associated with identifiers to profile them.
Purposes of such activities can be justifiable e.g. combat fraud, or
insidious e.g. to sell profiled data to third-parties. On the web, the
use of cookies enables sharing of identifiers across providers, while on
smartphones the device manufacturers themselves provide a unique
identifier to enable such tracking and profiling.</p>
<p>In Solid, given that storage is offered without any oversight of what
data is stored, who creates it, and why somebody uses it, it is possible
that applications and actors develop new forms of fingerprinting and
tracking techniques based on Solid’s functionalities. For example,
applications or the advertising libraries they use may develop a
well-formed URL such as <code>/userID</code> to store and retrieve data
associated with identifiers and profiles. This can be cleverly
obfuscated so that it remains hidden from users. In addition, the access
of all kinds of data within a Pod can further enhance the profiling
activities.</p>
<h3
id="lack-of-effective-control-via-limitations-on-data-exploitation">Lack
of Effective Control via Limitations on Data Exploitation</h3>
<p>The mission of Solid is to give control of data back to individuals.
But if apps do not store data in <em>usable</em> forms, such as by
utilising proprietary format, encrypting it, obfuscating it, or only
storing partial data within the Pod – then the users have the data but
no control to take advantage of it. While the GDPR tries to offset this
through its right to data portability that requires data to be provided
using machine-readable and commonly used formats, the actuality is that
this right is not respected correctly <span class="citation"
data-cites="krogerHowAppVendors2020 urbanStudySubjectData2019"><a
href="#ref-krogerHowAppVendors2020" role="doc-biblioref">[53]</a>, <a
href="#ref-urbanStudySubjectData2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[54]</a></span>. Solid Pods provide a convenient
method to retrieve and store data using GDPR <span class="citation"
data-cites="demulderPROV4ITDaTaTransparentDirect2021"><a
href="#ref-demulderPROV4ITDaTaTransparentDirect2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[24]</a></span>, but without appropriate methods to
ensure the data is actually useful and usable to the user and other
apps, a Pod becomes limited to the user acting as a controller for the
storage of information, while only some or apps with the ability to
understand the data are able to benefit from it.</p>
<p>A limited variant of this is where market actors create ecosystems
based on availability to data, such as through APIs and restrictions on
how data is accessed, which may not empower the user at all. For
example, consider smartphone applications that are entirely hosted
within the user’s <em>personal device</em> and also store their data on
device, but where the user can neither access that data nor enable other
apps to use it. This is designed as a security measure, with the
operating system determining limited forms of interoperability for data
(e.g. contact book, messaging, camera). If applied to Solid, this would
mean Pods that are entirely controlled by providers, with limitations on
how apps can use the data implemented as part of the Pod (e.g.
provider’s APIs), and with users only having limited capability to store
their data and accept its use by applications – similar to how
smartphones operate today.</p>
<h3 id="legal-compliance-and-enforcement">Legal Compliance and
Enforcement</h3>
<p>The interpretation of GDPR roles and obligations is a complex affair
which takes time to go through the legal processes since authorities
require certainty in their investigations before announcing violations,
and the subsequent decision-making by courts (and higher courts) takes a
lot of time. This issue is combined with lack of available resources for
authorities (e.g. not being provided with required funds), and lack of
domain expertise for increasing complexities in use-cases and technology
means GDPR enforcement has identifiable and systematic problems <span
class="citation" data-cites="FourYearsGDPR2022"><a
href="#ref-FourYearsGDPR2022" role="doc-biblioref">[55]</a></span>. This
is not to say the law is ineffective or should not be followed – on the
contrary, GDPR has resulted in benefits to individuals by raising the
transparency of information and creating new rights that empower
individuals <span class="citation"
data-cites="FourYearsGDPR2022 schutzDataProtectionAuthorities2022"><a
href="#ref-FourYearsGDPR2022" role="doc-biblioref">[55]</a>, <a
href="#ref-schutzDataProtectionAuthorities2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[56]</a></span>.</p>
<p>For Solid, the existing issues with enforcement are made more severe
because of deviation from established domain and GDPR terminology -
which first requires efforts such as this article to establish how GDPR
should be interpret for Solid, and further because there are no
systematic designs or implementations related to oversight,
accountability, and technical/organisational measures – which requires
legal compliance to be investigated and applied <em>from basic
principles</em>.</p>
<h3 id="burden-on-users-to-manage-privacy">Burden on Users to Manage
Privacy</h3>
<p>After all other issues, even where everything is valid in terms of
laws and social norms, the resulting responsibilities for users to
investigate each request and subsequent data uses as well as to manage
their own data and its security/privacy can end up becoming a burden.
Such cases are common in the form of ‘decision overload’ <span
class="citation" data-cites="nissenbaumContextualApproachPrivacy2011"><a
href="#ref-nissenbaumContextualApproachPrivacy2011"
role="doc-biblioref">[57]</a></span> whereby users choose seemingly
self-detrimental outcomes because of perceived non-contextuality and the
lack of relevant controls. Solid’s use of inconsistent terminologies,
lack of user-side tools and services, and inability to have effective
policies and agents that operate for and on behalf of the user increases
the possibilities for users to perceive management of Pods as a burden,
and creates opportunities for other issues to be exploited. It is not
necessary to solve this issue only through technological means, such as
developing an automated policy-reasoning service that acts on the user’s
behalf. Instead, other forms of socio-technical approaches should also
be considered that take advantage of the human-centricity of
technologies. For example, crowd-sourced management of privacy concerns
<span class="citation"
data-cites="tosdr wilsonCrowdsourcingAnnotationsWebsites2016"><a
href="#ref-tosdr" role="doc-biblioref">[44]</a>, <a
href="#ref-wilsonCrowdsourcingAnnotationsWebsites2016"
role="doc-biblioref">[58]</a></span>, establishment of codes of conduct
for Solid, and creating open app stores with vetting processes.</p>
<h2 id="sec:path-forward">Path Forward Towards Responsible
Innovation</h2>
<h3 id="establish-consistent-vocabulary">Establish Consistent
Vocabulary</h3>
<p>Currently the Solid specifications present new terms and concepts
that do not align well with existing well-established domains and
regulations. For example, Solid’s use of ‘owners’ is inconsistent with
cloud services where ownership and client/customers are well defined
concepts with legal relevance and interpretations. Similarly, Solid’s
use of ‘Agent’ is ambiguous and lacks relating Pods, resources, data,
and apps to legal roles such as Controllers, Processors, and Data
Subjects - which are necessary to understand and establish
responsibilities and accountability within use-cases. Solid’s ‘policies’
currently only contain rudimentary access control constraints, and lack
the nuances and extent required for understanding and managing data
practices based on legal (e.g. legal bases, purposes) and social norms
(e.g. sensitivity, risks).</p>
<p>To resolve this disparity, we strongly recommend the establishment of
a consistent vocabulary for expressing Solid’s use-cases in terms of
actors, roles, processes – and to use these to define obligations,
requirements, and other constraints on conformance. The outcome of this
should offer clarity regarding implementations in terms of which
entities are involved, how to hold them accountable, and to take
advantage of existing legal obligations and rights. This certainty will
assist all stakeholders (individuals, companies, authorities) in
establishing how Solid should be used as a legally-compatible paradigm
and enable realisation of its intended benefits.</p>
<p>Specifically, we envision the following concepts as needing
consistent vocabularies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Resources:</strong> Pods, storage (e.g. disks),
computation, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Entities:</strong> Providers, consumers, users, etc. for
Pods, resources, data, apps, identity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Legal Roles:</strong> Controllers, Processors, Data
Subjects, Authorities</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Agreements:</strong> Consent, Contract; but also
agreements associated with provisioning Pods, resources, data, and apps.
This can also be extended beyond current conventions, such as by
enabling users to have preferences and requirements, or using policies
to establish agreements with apps and services on the use of
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Notices:</strong> for Pods, resources, data, apps,
services, user, along with information on context such as specifics,
ex-ante or ex-post, provider and recipient.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data:</strong> establishing data categories for clarity
of what data is actually being utilised, indicating sensitivity of data
to understand risks and necessity of security, establishing when special
categories of personal data might be involved to better understand
impacts and legal obligations. In addition, separating data based on
whether it is related to users, use of apps (e.g. configurations), pod
management (e.g. data registries, app authorisations).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Processes:</strong> related to management and use of
Logging, Policy Management, Identity Management, Data Management,
Network Management, Data Storage, Compute, Data Query, App Management,
Management.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security:</strong> related to what security measures are
in place for Pods (e.g. firewalls), resources (e.g. access control),
data (e.g. encryption), apps, and users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Logs:</strong> maintaining logs related to data (e.g.
store, access, modify, source), apps (requests, authorisations),
policies (agreements, preferences), identity (e.g. users actions), and
security.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In creating these concepts, existing vocabularies can be utilised or
extended to avoid re-creating entirely new terms with unknown
interpretations. Sources for these can be ISO standards such as those
related to cloud service, or legal thesauri such as that established
within EU and based on GDPR, or community efforts such as Data Privacy
Vocabulary<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"

approaches to be discussed and developed by relevant communities, and is
a precursor to enable approaches mentioned in following paragraphs that
require machine-readable information for automation.</p>
<h3 id="clarity-of-concepts-and-processes-for-legal-compliance">Clarity
of Concepts and Processes for Legal Compliance</h3>
<p>Solid’s deviation from established legal terminology creates
difficulties in the interpretation and application of specific
jurisdictional regulations, such as GDPR’s requirements to establish
purposes and controllers. To avoid such differences from creating
obstacles, along with using established vocabularies, a Solid
implementation must also be capable of offering clarity on how it
relates to specific legal compliance concepts and obligations. For
example, when a user accepts use of an app from a provider, it should be
able to understand the involved controllers and processors, as well as
what rights are available and the information to exercise them.
Similarly, it should be clear what legal basis and purposes the app is
requesting to use the data for, what will happen once the data leaves
the Pod (e.g. sharing with third-parties), and if there are any
sensitive categories that the user should be aware of.</p>
<p>In order for this information to be available and accessible, it
should be mandatory for an app to provide this information, either with
the request or through a linked resource, in machine-readable form. An
app that does not satisfy this requirement should not be permitted to
initiate a request, or it should be discriminated as being
untrustworthy. This information, and other relevant records should be
maintained as logs within the Solid Pod. For example, logs recording the
creation of an authorisation decision along with specifics of entities
involved, and its scope (e.g. purposes, data categories).</p>
<p>It should be clarified within the specification, that an app’s
request to use data and the corresponding authorisation is a form of
consent, and therefore requires the necessary legally obligated
criterion to be satisfied to be considered valid. Where this is not the
case, the separate legal basis (e.g. contract) should be recorded and
handled accordingly. For specifying that a Pod or an app requires GDPR
compliance, the vocabulary should enable this information to be supplied
in machine-readable form, such as part of the app’s request, or a Pod’s
metadata (e.g. as <code>region:EU</code>). Where the legal basis is
consent, the withdrawal of consent should be communicated to the app,
either initiated by a Pod (e.g. sending a signal to the app’s specific
URL) or indicated the next time an app accesses data (e.g.
reinterpreting HTTP status code <em>451 Unavailable for Legal
Reasons</em>). In either case, it is vital for there to be no ambiguity
in the indication that consent has been withdraw, so that the
appropriate GDPR obligations are triggered regarding halting processing
of data outside the Pod (if any) and communicating the withdrawal to
other parties.</p>
<h3 id="enable-use-of-policies">Enable Use of Policies</h3>
<p>The current status-quo is the situation where all decision-making
power is concentrated with controllers and service providers, because
they are ones that decide what data will be processed and for which
purposes. The individuals on the receiving side of requests only have
the options to either agree to given choices, or lose out on whatever
features are being provided. In addition, this means it is always the
users who have to perform compatibility and risk assessments for a given
request based on what is acceptable and necessary for them regarding
privacy and security. It would be useful and empowering to both users,
if they had mechanisms that assist them in making such decisions by
taking their pre-configured choices and matching them with an app’s
request to determine compatibility <span class="citation"
data-cites="havurGreaterControlTransparency2020 estevesODRLProfileExpressing2021"><a
href="#ref-havurGreaterControlTransparency2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[16]</a>, <a
href="#ref-estevesODRLProfileExpressing2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[17]</a></span>.</p>
<p>A hypothetical implementation of such an assistive and
decision-support systems can be created using two kinds of policies
represented in Solid – (1) user’s preferences (that MAY be satisfied);
and (2) user’s requirements (that MUST be satisfied). When an app
request is initiated, the Pod would then check it for compatibility with
requirements where no deviation is possible, and with preferences where
some conditions may not be satisfied. The result of this (e.g. all
requirements satisfied, some preferences not satisfied) can then be
presented to the user (e.g. as part of the request, or in their
dashboards) to help indicate whether the app satisfies their privacy
requirements and to ease the burden of checking the app’s data
practices.</p>
<p>For such policies to be effective, it is also necessary for apps to
provide corresponding information as part of the request. The current
norm is that an app provides a vague summary of information within a
privacy notice <span class="citation"
data-cites="santosAreCookieBanners2020"><a
href="#ref-santosAreCookieBanners2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[47]</a></span>, while the privacy policy page
provides a large amount of information that is difficult to interpret
for a specific request <span class="citation"
data-cites="kretschmerCookieBannersPrivacy2021"><a

role="doc-biblioref">[42]</a></span>. Both of these issues can be
address by making it mandatory for an app to issue a request using
machine-readable information, and to require that this information be
limited to what the request is about. For example, rather than requiring
the user to agree to all possible purposes that an app can implement
across all of its services, the request must contain only the purposes
and data required for specific services associated with the request.
Such constraints can also encourage the use of <em>dynamic consent</em>
or <em>just-in-time consent</em> that does not overburden users with
excessive consenting at the start, but instead asks for consent in a
partial and modular manner based on triggers such as start of a feature
or service use <span class="citation"

<p>The role of policies goes beyond user assistance in decision-making
as they are also helpful to manage access control authorisations in
terms of generating and checking them for validity, and for logging data
accesses in terms of entities and purposes. In the new model where
policies are used to establish an user’s preferences, requirements, and
an app’s requests, the access control authorisations are generated as a
result of a successful agreement being reached between the user’s and
app’s policies by their respective agents. The logs for access control
therefore only need to indicate under which agreement the app is
requesting data, or to be more explicit - for which purposes the data is
being accessed is indicated by specifying the agreement under which that
purpose was agreed upon (note: this is possible because GDPR requires
separate consent and hence separate agreements for distinct
purposes).</p>
<p>The usefulness of policies over access control authorisations is also
evident from policies permitting more complex conditions to be expressed
and checked, such indicating requirements that any health data
(categories) should only be used for medical research (purpose) by
non-profit organisations (entities) within EU (location, jurisdiction).
Policies are also more transparent and accountable forms that can be
preserved for the user to introspect at their leisure. For example,
users can revisit their decision to share some data with a specific app
based on detection of corresponding changes in their preferences and
requirements.</p>
<h3 id="programmatic-and-machine-readable-notices">Programmatic and
Machine-readable Notices</h3>
<p>One of the issues we highlighted that is also applicable to Solid
use-cases involves misuse of notices in consenting and transparency
obligations. This is possible because such notices are generated by
controllers who have incentives to maximise the user’s acceptance of
choices regarding collection and sharing of their data. To avoid such
manipulations and exploitation from taking place, a radical solution to
shift the control of notices away from service providers and on to the
user’s who have to make decisions <span class="citation"
data-cites="panditProposalsResolvingConsenting2022"><a
href="#ref-panditProposalsResolvingConsenting2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[62]</a></span>. In such cases, the notices are
generated on the user- or client-side (i.e. by the Pod), and use
information provided by the controller (i.e. in machine-readable form).
While this has ample benefits for users in terms of customisation of
content, interface, personalisation using preferences and requirements,
and recommendations based on wisdom (e.g. community voted guidelines),
it is detrimental to companies who would want to retain control of
notices so as to have the ability to tweak their notices for purposes of
marketing (i.e. for legitimate purposes). In such cases, a compromise
would be to provide granular degrees of controls to controllers with the
notice ultimately still being generated on the client-side <span
class="citation" data-cites="panditProposalsResolvingConsenting2022"><a
href="#ref-panditProposalsResolvingConsenting2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[62]</a></span>.</p>
<h3 id="user-side-risk-management">User-side Risk Management</h3>
<p>Another common norm that works against the interest of the users is
that they are unable to assess the risks and impacts associated with a
given request, either because of lack of knowledge or because the
necessary information is complex or hidden from them. With
decentralisation, use of machine-readable requests, and programmatic
notices, it is also possible Pods to provide risk assessment and
management features for their users. For example, by detecting and
highlighting that a given request involves use of sensitive data, the
notice will be generated with corresponding indication of higher risk.
Another example, where the user-agent assists with handling requests by
performing risk assessments, and identifying problematic patterns such
as the final agreement involving excessive data being collected, or data
being share with too many third-parties, and to suggest corresponding
changes to preferences and requirements in order to mitigate risks, such
as by deselecting purposes that involve excessive third-parties. The
patterns can be established based on common interoperable vocabularies
being used in policies, and using the existing state of the art as well
as crowd-funded lists as sources. In this manner, the users get the
convenience of not requiring excessive investigations and
decision-making with the assurance of their privacy not suffering as a
consequence.</p>
<h2 id="sec:conclusion">Concluding Remarks</h2>
<p>In this article, we established how to interpret Solid first as a
cloud-based technology, and then in terms of different functionalities.
Through these, we provided a framework to assist in representation of
Solid-based use-cases and established how existing cloud services and
their providers are associated with its implementations. This enables
assessing the resulting behaviour of Solid Pods in terms of what
resources are involved, who are the entities associated with them, who
has control, and who is accountable, and what freedoms and capabilities
are exhibited by a Pod. We explored implications of use-cases by
considering the different arrangement of entities and resources, and
determined the resulting implications on control retained by the
individual. This article thus establishes a framework for investigating
whether a given use-case or implementation does indeed fulfil Solid’s
vision to empower individual through data sovereignty, or continues
current practices and its problems by only marginally changing the data
storage mechanism.</p>
<p>We then investigat how GDPR applies to Solid by interpreting its
principles in terms of Solid’s concepts and implementations. Our
analysis shows a clear and severe deficiency between Solid’s
specifications and the concepts, compliance obligations, and enforcement
as envisioned by GDPR. More critically, we found potential difficulties
in investigations of GDPR compliance for Solid-based use-cases due to
lack of support in Solid specifications or its implementation in
considering basic accountability and responsibility mechanisms afforded
by legal processes. We also identified the necessity for further
exploring the determination of controllers and processors based on the
roles of entities within a Solid use-case regarding determination of
purposes and retention of control. This is separate from the issue of
apps being associated with controllers - which we highlight as a problem
due to current lack of requirements for apps to declare who operates
them. We have also highlighted the impacts arising from Solid in terms
of exercising rights, cross-border data transfers, data breaches, and
enforcement of GDPR’s principles.</p>
<p>Finally, we found that severe problems present in conventional
use-cases that have known GDPR compliance violations. Their severity was
increased due to lack of certain processes within Solid which make it
difficult if not impossible to apply known remedies. We discussed
potential approaches that can resolve these problems, both using known
and novel research and developments, with a specific focus on how Solid
be further developed or extended, and through use of both technical and
socio-technical innovations. To argue for their feasibility, we included
relevant associations with existing efforts for each argument.</p>
<p>Thus, through this article, we have presented our findings regarding
making sense of Solid in terms of how to first understand the use of
Solid within a use-case, its implications on abilities and control by
various actors, and to then investigate its legality in terms of GDPR.
Going beyond merely pointing out problems, we also discussed what should
be developed to address specific problems. Our arguments point towards
the necessity for first developing interoperable vocabularies as the
basis for enabling all other automated approaches, and to then utilise
these as conformance criteria that is mandatory for Solid’s resources to
exhibit in implementations. Further, we identify specific tools and
processes that can be developed to assist the user in their
decision-making and to inspect their data use, while also suggesting the
use of communities to mitigate burdens on individuals. Through these, we
hope to have provided a path based on pragmatism and responsible
development that can take Solid towards the realisation of its
vision.</p>
