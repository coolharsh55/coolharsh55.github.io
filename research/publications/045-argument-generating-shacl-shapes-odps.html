        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Shapes Constraint Language<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> (SHACL) is the W3C
specification for describing and validating constraints over RDF graphs.
The constraints defined using SHACL, called ‘shapes’, are themselves
expressed using RDF with the set of constraints being termed as ‘shape
graph’ and the RDF data being validated called the ‘data graph’. Shapes
offer a description of the data graph in the form of constraints that a
valid data graph should satisfy. This is based on the closed-world
assumption where the information is required to be present and
satisfying the conditions of the constraint, with any other alternative
including absence considered to be invalid. SHACL is thus useful as a
testing mechanism to determine the suitability or the quality of the
data based on a given set of constraints. In addition to this, SHACL has
applications for other purposes such as code generation and data
integration where presence and correctness of information is
required.</p>
<p>Creation of shapes using SHACL is invariably tied to the schema or
ontology used within the data graph, where the shapes utilise the
concepts and relationships to define constraints. These schemas and
ontologies (usually) contain axioms in their definition of concepts and
relationships, and which can also serve the purpose of specifying
constraints over them. A simple example of this are
<code>rdfs:domain</code> and <code>rdfs:range</code> which specify the
category of concepts acceptable for a property’s domain and range
respectively. While a reasoner uses these to infer the type of entity, a
validation constraint can use these to ensure a valid type is being
used. More complex examples include OWL assertions regarding subclasses
or equivalence using constraints over properties. Thus, the axioms
defined in an ontology can also be used to validate data - and their use
could help in avoiding duplicity of constraints between ontologies and
SHACL.</p>
<p>Where the data being validated uses a single ontology, the axioms in
that ontology can be utilised to validate the data. However, in cases
where the data uses multiple schemas or ontologies - the axioms defined
in one or all ontologies no longer reflect the ‘shape’ of the data, and
therefore cannot be used in validations readily. Additionally, the data
graph may selectively use concepts and properties from different
ontologies in a ‘mix-and-match’ approach which further reduces the
possibility of reusing axioms to derive constraints since they may
depend on concepts not present in the graph.</p>
<p>By contrast, an Ontology Design Pattern (ODP) is defined as a
collection of concepts and relationships necessary to define a
particular context. Such ODPs can combine or be extended with concepts
and relationships from multiple ontologies to express new relationships
between them. An ODP can also be made significantly more abstract and
generalised - which makes it suitable for reuse across ontologies and
data graphs. Additionally, given that an ODP is by design smaller and
more modular than a comparatively larger ontology, the axioms defined
within it are more suitable for validation given the likelihood of more
instances adhering to it. Therefore, ODPs and its axioms can be readily
adapted to constraints in SHACL shapes for validation. An added
advantage of ODPs is that they are easier to maintain and evolve with
the use-case and its data as compared to ontologies.</p>
<p>The argument for using ontology design patterns to define SHACL
shapes was originally put forth in a position paper <span
class="citation" data-cites="pandit_using_2018"><a
href="#ref-pandit_using_2018" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span>. It
discussed similarity between the axioms used to model ODPs and the
constraints within SHACL shapes, and how this could be used in
generation of SHACL shapes for validation of instances. The aim and
motivation behind this was to investigate the automation of SHACL shape
generation from modular patterns for a given data graph, and to
encourage the reuse of ODPs outside of modelling ontologies for
validating RDF graphs. In this article, we expand on our argument with
recent developments in the field of automated validation of data,
extraction of constraints from data, and the conversion between OWL2 and
SHACL. The rest of the article contains: use of ODP axioms to generate
SHACL shapes in <a href="#sec:pandit_shacl_constraints"

<h2 id="sec:pandit_shacl_constraints">ODP axioms and SHACL shapes</h2>
<p>An axiom is defined within description logic as a logical statement
relating roles and/or concepts <span class="citation"
data-cites="grau_owl_2008"><a href="#ref-grau_owl_2008"
role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span>. Axioms in an ontology define
constraints over concepts and relationships that must be satisfied by
the instances that use the ontology. These axioms cannot be reused as
part of an ODP as this can cause issues with missing entities
(dependencies) which are not part of the ODP. Instead, the ODP defines
its own set of axioms that are limited to only those concepts and
relationships that are a part of it. This enables the ODP to be an
independent and modular component.</p>
<p>In general terms, an ODP is essentially equivalent to a shape in
SHACL given that they are both abstract when compared to the rest of the
data, localised to the concepts in question, modular given that they can
be combined, and context-dependant on the ontology or data. While SHACL
permits nesting and cross-linking of constraints, we can consider them
as specifying composition and inclusion of related constraints similar
to building an ODP with axioms. Existing work comparing OWL axioms and
SHACL <span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_shacl_nodate"><a
href="#ref-noauthor_shacl_nodate" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span>
finds the expressibility of OWL being comparable to the SHACL Core
vocabulary, and that syntactic translation between OWL and SHACL is
straight-forward in most cases. Automating this process involves two
steps - first to identify the relevant OWL statements forming a single
constraint, and second to then generate their equivalent SHACL shape
constraints. Since both OWL and SHACL are essentially defined using RDF
triples, both steps can be performed programmatically using the table of
associated concepts mapping OWL and SHACL constraints <span
class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_shacl_nodate"><a
href="#ref-noauthor_shacl_nodate"
role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span>.</p>
<h2 id="sec:pandit_shacl_example">Example</h2>
<p>The MicroBlog ODP <span class="citation"
data-cites="shimizu_ontology_2017"><a href="#ref-shimizu_ontology_2017"
role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span> is based on real-world use-cases for
modelling data related to tweets (Twitter posts). Data instances based
on the ODP will therefore have validation requirements that ensure its
correctness based on the specific axioms used in the definition of the
ODP. It’s core class, <em>MicroblogEntry</em>, defines three axioms
describing constraints and relationships within the ODP, which are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span
class="math inline">MicroblogEntry ⊑ ∀  = 1hasPayload.Payload</span></p></li>
<li><p><span
class="math inline">MicroblogEntry ⊑ ∀  = 1hasAuthor.Author</span></p></li>
<li><p><span
class="math inline">MicroblogEntry ⊑ ∀≤ 1writtenAt.Location</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>These define that <em>MicroblogEntry</em> has exactly one payload
(text of the tweet), exactly one author, and may have zero or one
location(s). Any instance of the <em>MicroblogEntry</em> class that
fails these constraints can be said to be invalid for the purposes of
its intended context. The axioms are defined<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
using <em>rdfs:subClassOf</em> and <em>owl:Restriction</em> as:</p>
<pre style="pandit_codestyle"><code>:MicroblogEntry rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :ReportingEvent ,
        [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
          owl:onProperty :hasPayload ;
          owl:qualifiedCardinality &quot;1&quot;^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ;
          owl:onClass :Payload
        ] ,
        [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
          owl:onProperty :hasAuthor ;
          owl:qualifiedCardinality &quot;1&quot;^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ;
          owl:onClass :Author
        ] ,
        [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
          owl:onProperty :writtenAt ;
          owl:maxQualifiedCardinality &quot;1&quot;^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ;
          owl:onClass :Location
        ] .</code></pre>
<p>Reusing the axioms in the ODP to directly generate the corresponding
constraints in a SHACL shape using <em>sh:class</em> and
<em>sh:qualified(Max/Min)Count</em> conditions gives the following SHACL
shape:</p>
<pre style="pandit_codestyle"><code>:MicroblogEntryShape
    a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass :MicroblogEntry ;
    
    sh:property [
        sh:path :hasPayload ;
        sh:class :Payload ;
        sh:MinCount 1;
        sh:MaxCount 1;
    ] ,
    sh:property [
        sh:path :hasAuthor ;
        sh:class :Author ;
        sh:MinCount 1;
        sh:MaxCount 1;
    ] .
    sh:property [
        sh:path :hasAuthor ;
        sh:class :Author ;
        sh:MinCount 0;
        sh:MaxCount 1;
    ] .</code></pre>
<p>The SHACL shape defines constraints for two of the axioms with given
cardinalities. The third axiom defines an optional triple which provides
an optional constraint with only the maximum cardinality. This is
represented with an implicit cardinality of minimum count being zero to
specify none or at most one location entities should be allowed.</p>
<p>Application of this in practice involves translating the ODP to the
ontology or schema used in the data, such as an ontology for Twitter,
and converting the SHACL constraints to use the corresponding concepts.
This can be done automatically with a mapping table between the ODP and
the Twitter ontology concepts, which is then used to rewrite the SHACL
rules using the schema used in the data graph. In case the Twitter
ontology directly utilises the ODP - the SHACL constraint can be used as
is.</p>
<p>The actual advantage of this is apparent when the data graph contains
multiple types of schemas - such as for Twitter, Facebook, Emails. In
this case, a single ODP can be applied to represent a ‘blog’ or ‘email’
from all three, with additional ODPs specifically developed or extracted
from an ontology. Where features differ between the ontologies, specific
ODPs can be developed without changing the other ODPs used in the data
description and shape generation process. Thus, ODPs are a tool for
abstraction of the data and their use in constraint validation is akin
to the concept of ‘unit testing’ in software engineering. Another
example is utilising provenance ODPs to ensure all incoming data in a
heterogeneous graph has information about its source and
derivations.</p>
<h2 id="sec:pandit_shacl_sota">Recent advances in State of the Art</h2>
<p>The topic of detecting the schemas used in a data graph is not new -
it has been researched in connection with graph summaries, data
ingestion and workflows, and reuse of schema-less datasets. In
comparison, SHACL and its relation with OWL2 for schema-detection and
data validation are new topics and have seen sparse research. Here we
summarise recent advances in this field within the last few years.</p>
<p>Savković et al. <span class="citation"
data-cites="savkovic_validation_2019"><a
href="#ref-savkovic_validation_2019" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></span>
describe an approach for creating SHACL constraints given a data graph
containing an OWL2 QL ontology and an existing set of SHACL constraints.
Their approach uses constraint rewriting to transform a subset of SHACL
constraints such that it can validate both the ontology as well as the
data in the graph. The article also highlights the complexities in such
operation, its feasibility, and the necessity of restricting SHACL
constraints to not contain negative or cardinality restrictions. While
the approach does not directly derive SHACL constraints from the
ontology or data - it presents an argument for the expensiveness of such
as approach over a large-scale graph.</p>
<p>Recent approaches have also explored the extraction of schema and
constraints from a given data graph with promising results. ABSTAT <span
class="citation" data-cites="spahiu_towards_2018"><a
href="#ref-spahiu_towards_2018" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span>
extracts ontology patterns from data along with metrics about its use,
and creates a semantic profile that describes characteristics about the
data. The semantic profiles are then transformed into SHACL for the
validation of constraints through automated generation of constraints.
Boneva et al. <span class="citation" data-cites="boneva_semi_2019"><a
href="#ref-boneva_semi_2019" role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span>
similarly also extract patterns from data and use it in the construction
of SHACL constraints. Their approach detects schemas used in an existing
RDF dataset and creates constraints using either SHACL or ShEx to
validate the data graph. The tool described in the article provides for
an interactive workflow where the extracted schema can be manually
edited - with visual feedback on the application of constraints based on
the schema and its results over data. Astrea <span class="citation"
data-cites="cimmino_astrea_2020"><a href="#ref-cimmino_astrea_2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></span> is a tool that generates SHACL
shapes from ontologies using a set of mappings (called Astrea-KG) that
allow the generation of SHACL shapes from one or more ontologies. The
use of mappings allows Astrea to work with a variety of ontologies with
positive results. The cited article also provides a good overview of
related approaches.</p>
<p>In addition to these, there have been notable development for the
support of SHACL and ODPs in the ontology development and data
validation fields. SHACL4P <span class="citation"
data-cites="ekaputra_shacl4p_2016"><a href="#ref-ekaputra_shacl4p_2016"
role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a></span> is a Protégé plugin for defining and
validating Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL). The possibility of
creating SHACL constraints in the same environment as ontology
engineering provides a good opportunity to interleave the advantages of
both. Similarly, Comprehensive Modular Ontology IDE (CoModIDE) <span
class="citation" data-cites="shimizu_modular_2020"><a
href="#ref-shimizu_modular_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span> is
a tool for developing modular ontology patterns using graphical and
visual paradigms. Evaluators of the tool found it simpler and easier to
use as compared to Protégé in the tasks related to ontology pattern use
and development.</p>
<h2 id="sec:pandit_shacl_conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Through this article, we presented our arguments towards the use of
ontology design patterns (ODPs) to generate SHACL shapes. The approach
involves use of axioms defined within ODPs to generate equivalent SHACL
shape constraints for data validation over a RDF dataset using those
ODPs. The article provides an example of this where the RDF triples
representing the ODP axioms within an OWL file are used to generate
their corresponding SHACL shape. The state of the art, presented in <a
href="#sec:pandit_shacl_sota" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="sec:pandit_shacl_sota">[sec:pandit_shacl_sota]</a>,
shows progress on schema detection and extraction, and its use in
automating SHACL shape generation process.</p>
<p>While ontologies are a good way to document the schema of a data
graph, documentation and schema extraction is complex when using
multiple ontologies or in a heterogeneous graph. By using ODPs, which
are modular and specific to features or context, documentation can be
created in parts and specific to use-cases. However, creation of ODPs is
difficult where the structure of data is not known. Approaches that
extract SHACL shapes from data can be utilised to transform these shapes
into ODPs which can then be combined into larger ontologies over time.
In this manner, ODPs along with SHACL are also useful to act as
documentation for description of data in a graph. Where the state of the
art provides solutions for realising this, the community needs to
further advocate ODPs in their role of describing data and possibility
of automating validation processes.</p>
<p>We particularly emphasise the use of ODPs rather than ontologies as
the basis of validation because RDF graphs can contain multiple
ontologies where the axioms from those ontologies may not be sufficient
or applicable for verification of the data graph. Data engineers can
utilise ODPs in their task based on scenarios and use-cases, which
knowledge engineers can build up sufficient ontologies over time.
Existing approaches that automate the extraction of schema and
generation of SHACL shapes show the viability of this.</p>
<p>This approach also encourages the reuse of ODPs beyond the data
modelling phase. Relating ODPs with their corresponding SHACL shapes
provides a way to visualise the model of the data as well as to validate
it using the same context. The ODPs defined in this manner are modelled
more closer to the instances used in actual RDF graphs, and can
therefore be used in approaches such as data summarising, visualisation,
and exploration. Conversely, ODPs can assist approaches relevant to
validation such as visualising SHACL shapes. This can be done by taking
SHACL shapes and generating corresponding ODPs to represent their
context.</p>
<p>In terms of future work, the approach discussed in this article
should be applied to the larger set of vocabularies and datasets
presented in the linked data cloud. This would provide a way to detect
and collect ODPs used in the data and compare their relevance to the
existing vocabularies. Further to this, the automated creation of SHACL
constraints from ODPs (and ontologies) has benefits to evolving datasets
such as DBpedia and WikiData. Where existing approaches only consider
the SHACL core vocabulary in shape generation, there is a need for
further investigation in mapping the features provided by SHACL advanced
and SHACL-SPARQL to the OWL2 profiles. The ability to convert OWL axioms
to SPARQL queries using approaches such as OWL2SPARQL<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
allow the generation of SHACL shapes from ODPs by using the SHACL-SPARQL
features which need to be harmonised with their use in validating data
graphs. Similarly, anti-patterns in both OWL and SHACL that increase
complexity for validation also need to be investigated.</p>
<p>We started our argument based on the intended application to automate
generation of SHACL shapes from existing patterns/models describing the
data. The aim of this was to validate a data graph based on specific
contexts (represented through ODPs), and reusing the same validation
mechanisms to check for existence and correctness of required data in
the graph. The reporting feature of SHACL would then be used to produce
a documentation based on the outcome of the validation to describe the
quality of data. With the recent development of graphical tools for
supporting ontological engineering, we also believe that this approach
has value in an educational setting by permitting rapid development of
ODPs and assessing their effect on data through querying and validation
of constraints similar to existing practices in the software engineering
and data-science domains.</p>
