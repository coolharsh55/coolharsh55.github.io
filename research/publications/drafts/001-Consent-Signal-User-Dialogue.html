    Description: Consent dialogues are a source of annoyance, malicious intent, dark patterns, illegal practices and a plethora of other issues. This work presents known problems based on GDPR requirements grouped into two categories: (i) UI/UX for consenting; and (ii) power imbalance in expressing consent. To resolve this, it presents two proposals: First, the use of automation through privacy signals to better govern consenting processes and to reduce ‘consent-fatigue’. Second, as generation of consent dialogues on the user side and its practicalities for both websites as well as users and agents (e.g. web browsers). Both proposals are discussed in terms of possibilities for implementation and suitability for stakeholders. The article concludes with a discussion on the difficulties in achieving such solutions owing to the conflicts of interest between ‘web-enablers’ and ‘web-consumers’, and the necessity for the EU to take a direct stance in addressing these in their future laws.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>The mechanisms surrounding consenting on the web are today rife with
problematic issues (for an overview, refer to <a href="#sec:issues"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:issues">2</a>) that
threaten its use as a means for organisations to source personal data,
and for people to exercise their agency and rights - in compliance with
privacy and data protection regulations. The requirements established by
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provide a legal framework
through which authorities can take action and dissuade their
prevalence.</p>
<p>However, in practice, such enforcement has not been effective in
terms of mitigating such issues despite the requirements of GDPR being
known for 5 years (2016-2022). This is evident from the existing
prevalence of such issues, as well as the actions of consumer protection
organisations and NGOs in calling for better enforcement of the GDPR.
Notable examples include: The European Parliament’s resolution <span
class="citation" data-cites="EU_Parliament_GDPR_report_2021"><a
href="#ref-EU_Parliament_GDPR_report_2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span> on implementation of the GDPR; The
Irish Council of Civil Liberties suing <span class="citation"
data-cites="ICCLSuesDPC2022"><a href="#ref-ICCLSuesDPC2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span> the Irish Data Protection Commission
with the claim of failed duties in enforcing GDPR for Real Time Bidding
(RTB) as a ‘data breach’; and None of Your Business (NOYB) filing 422
formal complaints regarding consenting dialogues <span class="citation"
data-cites="NoybFiles422a"><a href="#ref-NoybFiles422a"
role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span>.</p>
<p>This has resulted in concerns regarding the performance and
effectiveness of Data Protection Authorities (DPAs), and has resulted
into an official enquiry by the EU Ombudsman <span class="citation"
data-cites="EuropeanCommissionFailure"><a
href="#ref-EuropeanCommissionFailure"
role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span> to look into the EU Commission’s
handling of GDPR enforcement. At the same time, DPAs have (repeatedly)
indicated the lack of available expertise and funding required to be
effective in their duties, which has had an effect on the ability to
effectively address the large amount of complaints they receive <span
class="citation" data-cites="EuropeEnforcementParalysis2021a"><a
href="#ref-EuropeEnforcementParalysis2021a"
role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></span>.</p>
<p>To date, typical actions undertaken by DPAs have included specific
investigations into problematic areas of technologies, such as facial
recognition, and to issue guidelines that call upon organisations to
effectively ensure their own compliance in the hopes of self-regulation
fixing existing known problems. The few high-profile decisive cases,
such as CNIL’s fine to Google <span class="citation"
data-cites="DeliberationSAN2021023December2022"><a
href="#ref-DeliberationSAN2021023December2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span> and Facebook <span class="citation"
data-cites="DeliberationSAN2021024December2022"><a
href="#ref-DeliberationSAN2021024December2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span> regarding their consenting practices
has failed to have any domino effect or reactive changes<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>GDPR allows for easing some of the investigation and compliance
efforts through creation of codes of conduct and certifications.
However, to date, no such mechanism exists that applies itself to remedy
or prevent issues regarding consent. While IAB Europe has applied to
utilise its Transparency &amp; Control Framework (TCF) framework as a
code of conduct, the recent (FEB’22) decision by the Belgian DPA
concerning the legality of TCF <span class="citation"
data-cites="BEDPARestore"><a href="#ref-BEDPARestore"
role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></span> and its use by the advertisement
industry reaffirms important issues about the legitimacy of RTB
mechanisms in the first place <span class="citation"
data-cites="vealeAdtechRealTimeBidding2021 vealeImpossibleAsksCan2022"><a
href="#ref-vealeAdtechRealTimeBidding2021" role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a>,
<a href="#ref-vealeImpossibleAsksCan2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span>. It also raises the question on how
individuals and society at large do not have a medium to participate in
such processes to outlay a balance between rights and requirements
without getting into the legal quagmires of being controllers themselves
<span class="citation" data-cites="edwardsDataSubjectsData2019"><a
href="#ref-edwardsDataSubjectsData2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></span>.</p>
<p>While all the above should be used in demanding greater effectiveness
of the law through its enforcement agents (courts and DPAs), this
article argues that such effectiveness should not rely solely on the
capabilities of the organisations to self-regulate, but should instead
<strong>motivate socio-technical solutions that mitigate the root causes
of known prolonged issues</strong>. This would require a change within
the EU’s approach towards development and utilisation standards in
connection with legal compliance, where the onus is always on assisting
organisations with their legal compliance tasks. While the EU has
promoted standards developments in a more globally cohesive manner, such
as through co-operation agreement between CEN/CENELEC and ISO<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, it has refused to take any measures
on the technologies and standards that underline the use of internet or
its standardisation processes<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> (e.g. IETF, W3C). As a
result - the capabilities, values, and features developed within such
technologies do not assist with any of the requirements established by
the GDPR to increase the expected level of privacy and data
protection.</p>
<p>For example, consider the prevalence of cookie banners to fulfil
requirements of the ePrivacy Directive (ePD, 2002) to provide
information and management of cookies to users, and which are known to
have widespread issues <span class="citation"
data-cites="fouadComplianceCookiePurposes2020 matteCookieBannersRespect2020 santosAreCookieBanners2020a soeCircumventionDesignDark2020"><a
href="#ref-fouadComplianceCookiePurposes2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a>–<a
href="#ref-soeCircumventionDesignDark2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[15]</a></span>. In the 20 years since ePD was
adopted, the underlying technological mechanisms in terms of how cookies
can be set by websites and managed by users within their browsers have
not changed in significance other than browsers attempting to prevent
their usage in tracking and surveillance. To date, there is no cookie
categorisation specification through which websites can clearly indicate
what the cookies are necessary for, nor are there any cookie management
interfaces for users within the web browsers. Now with GDPR, cookie
banners have been supplemented with consenting interfaces that also show
similar issues <span class="citation"
data-cites="utzInformedConsentStudying2019 fouadComplianceCookiePurposes2020 grayDarkPatternsLegal2020 machuletzMultiplePurposesMultiple2020 matteCookieBannersRespect2020 mattePurposesIABEurope2020 nouwensDarkPatternsGDPR2020 santosAreCookieBanners2020a soeCircumventionDesignDark2020 santosConsentManagementPlatforms2021"><a
href="#ref-fouadComplianceCookiePurposes2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a>–<a
href="#ref-santosConsentManagementPlatforms2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[21]</a></span>, and demonstrate the same pattern
of no fundamental developments being undertaken to remedy them at a
technological level.</p>
<p>To sum all of the above, this article raises the question,
“<strong><em>What significant developments are needed to mitigate the
widespread issues or malpractices associated with the application and
use of consenting interfaces?</em></strong>”</p>
<h3 id="existing-approaches">Existing Approaches</h3>
<p>Researchers have proposed several interesting approaches regarding
how users can express, communicate, manage, control, and enforce their
privacy and decisions<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. However, this article focuses on
concrete proposals used or proposed by stakeholder organisations so as
to limit the discussion on feasible applications for real-world issues.
The focus here is on user-side solutions as alternatives to the
industry-specified standards, such as the TCF and its exclusive use by
Consent Management Platforms (CMPs), which can be argued to be the cause
of such issues itself <span class="citation"
data-cites="vealeAdtechRealTimeBidding2021 vealeImpossibleAsksCan2022"><a
href="#ref-vealeAdtechRealTimeBidding2021" role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a>,
<a href="#ref-vealeImpossibleAsksCan2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span>. This is to counter the
<em>status-quo</em> where industry members band together to create a
solution that only they can participate within, and which is then forced
upon users under the guise of a compliant framework.</p>
<p>Existing attempts at creating standardised approaches, such as Do Not
Track<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> (DNT) and Platform for Privacy
Preferences<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> (P3P) are either obsolete or
abandoned, with new proposals including Global Privacy Control<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> (GPC) and the Advanced Data
Protection Control<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> (ADPC) being candidates for
investigation.</p>
<p>GPC has been developed to be applied within California’s Consumer
Protection Act (CCPA) <span class="citation" data-cites="CCPA"><a
href="#ref-CCPA" role="doc-biblioref">[22]</a></span>, and is a unary
(single value) signal that expresses ‘do not sell’ as per the CCPA’s
enforceable obligation of providing an option to prohibit organisations
from ‘selling’ data to other third parties. GPC has been adopted by
numerous high-profile websites such as the New York Times and is
implemented by web browsers such as Brave and Firefox.</p>
<p>ADPC is a specification for expression and communication of
information regarding purposes and their use in giving or withdrawing
consent and exercising the right to object. Developed by None of Your
Business (NOYB) as part of the RESPECTeD project<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>,
ADPC currently does not provide the necessary information for how
specific purposes should be expressed in an interoperable manner and the
governance processes that should be followed by each actor i.e.
websites, user-agents, and the users.</p>
<p>While both GPC and ADPC claim to be actionable under the GDPR and
ePrivacy Directive as automated signals (i.e. GDPR Art.7 for withdrawing
consent and Art.21 for right to object), there are important issues that
need clarification for their effectiveness. For GPC, the difference
between its CCPA-influenced terminology and that of GDPR (e.g. sell,
third-party) prevents a clear interpretation for how it applies under
GDPR<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. For ADPC, a lack of implementation
details prevents its realisation and possibly effective adoption, e.g. a
website implementing ADPC requires certainty that the user-agent
understands its purposes, which necessitates some interoperability,
which ADPC does not provide. As the DPAs or other data protection bodies
have not commented on authoritative interpretations of these proposals,
it is an unresolved question as to the effectiveness of these in
mitigating issues regarding consenting online.</p>

<h3 id="research-goals">Research Goals</h3>
<p>Rather than expressing an entirely new proposal, this articles takes
the view that harmonised developments over existing proposals are better
to consolidate stakeholder support. For this, it aims to resolve known
issues and improve current consenting mechanisms by proposing novel use
of existing information and communication protocols, namely HTML and
ADPC respectively. Through these, it proposes a radical alternative to
the current status quo of website-controlled consent interfaces where
implementation of user-side consenting interfaces is argued to be
useful, practical, and feasible. The rest of the article is structured
in terms of the following research goals:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>To identify, categorise, and analyse existing issues regarding
consenting on the web</p></li>
<li><p>To address identified issues using ADPC by proposing extensions
for:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Communication of information and decisions</p></li>
<li><p>Establishing a shared interoperable vocabulary</p></li>
<li><p>Generation of consent dialogues on user-side</p></li>
<li><p>Annotating dialogues with semantic markup</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>To discuss practicality of proposed work through legal, industry,
and socio-technical perspectives</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="sec:issues">Categorisation of Issues</h2>
<p>‘Issue’ in this context refers to a problematic aspect that prevents
the effective or intended mechanism of consenting from realising i.e.
preventing the individual from understanding and controlling the
existence and extent of personal data processing associated with them.
For identification of issues, the state of the art was generated through
a literature search (in Q2-Q4 2021) and reviewed using the following
methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Searching for related keywords: consent, CMP, GDPR, cookie,
banner, dialogue, dark patterns, compliance</p></li>
<li><p>Publications at relevant venues: privacy, security, data
protection, law, HCI, networking</p></li>
<li><p>Authoritative sources: DPA (including EDPS and EDPB) guidelines,
DPA decisions and filed complaints (where made available), court
proceedings</p></li>
<li><p>Secondary and Tertiary identifications through citations from
collected literature</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The collected references were filtered for relevance based on
directly addressing issues associated with GDPR’s consenting
requirements, and were discarded otherwise (e.g. where dealing with
ePrivacy Directive or CCPA or other consenting requirements). These
selected references were then categorised as to which GDPR requirement
they addressed, with possibility to link multiple requirements for the
same work. The GDPR requirements used here were: (i) Rec. 43 - freely
given; (ii) Rec. 43 - specific; (iii) Rec. 43 - unambigious; (iv)
Art.13, Art.14 - Information provision; (v) Art.6 - Legal Basis; (vi)
Art.7 - withdrawal; and (vii) Art.9 - explicit consent.</p>
<p>In this exercise, neither the collected literature nor the GDPR
requirements are exhaustive or definitive, but are intended to be a
preliminary collection sufficient to demonstrate the existence of
categories so as to justify the proposed solutions that address them.
Future work in this regards therefore involves performing an exhaustive
literature search to identify issues, categories, and requirements not
presented here. The identified literature, relevance to GDPR’s
requirements, and their categorisation across three broad topics of HCI
(e.g. interfaces, UI/UX, comprehension), IT (e.g. technical
implementation), and Law (e.g. enforceability) are presented in .</p>
<p>The following are some observations :</p>
<p><strong>Issues related to information</strong>: terminology used in
description depends on framing of concepts, their granularity (broad vs
specific), and can lead to missing or incomplete information. In this,
users have no means to understand exactly what these terms mean or to
provide a vocabulary they understand or are comfortable with.</p>
<p><strong>Issues related to presentation of information</strong>:
complex information, with layering used to hide problematic aspects
(e.g. third-party sharing), with the placement of information and
choices having a ‘nudging’ effect. In this, users have no alternatives,
must interact with given interfaces, and are faced with ‘consent
fatigue’.</p>
<p><strong>Issues related to presentation of choices/options</strong>:
active manipulation through design choices, nudging, consent wall,
disparity or imbalance between choices, preselected options, layering
(hiding options). The user does not have fair choices due to being
provided an interface designed for such manipulation or coercion. Even
where interfaces may not be directly manipulative, them being cumbersome
is enough to dissuade users from configuring options.</p>
<p><strong>Issues related to expression of choice</strong>: no choice
provided (e.g. no reject button), disparity in placement of choice (e.g.
accept on 1st layer, refuse in 2nd), pre-selected options, granularity
(e.g. agree all but refuse individually), layering (hiding choices in
different layers), assumption (e.g. consent on scrolling or visiting),
fatigue or no of actions (excessive actions e.g. to refuse all). In
this, it is evident that users are aware of disparities, but gravitate
towards ‘easy’ actions for getting the dialogue out of the way. At other
times, users are not aware of choices e.g. they are ‘hidden’ in another
layer or option.</p>
<p><strong>Issues related to third-parties</strong>: hiding scale/scope
of third party sharing, and insufficient information for each
third-party. In this, some interfaces deliberately made it difficult to
control sharing data with third-parties e.g. by using legitimate
interest on consent refusal, or forcing selection over hundreds of third
parties individually.</p>
<p><strong>Issues related to legal basis</strong>: incorrect legal basis
(e.g. legitimate interest instead of consent), and incorrect consent
expression quality (e.g. not explicit) were predominant in practice.
Users are not expected to discern the existence of such requirements or
have the cognitive willingness to indulge in detection of their
misuse.</p>
<p>From the above exercise, the proposals for solutions are broadly
specified as two forms of technological innovations to address known
issues: <strong>(1) Automating the expression of decisions</strong> - to
prevent and mitigate consent fatigue, repetitive consenting, and to
ensure consistent expression of user decisions; and <strong>(2)
Providing a user-controlled method for expression of decisions</strong>
- to prevent and mitigate dark patterns, manipulative design choices,
and coercion.</p>
<h2 id="extending-adpc">Extending ADPC</h2>
<p>The ADPC specification currently defines multiple ways for obtaining
information about the intended processing purposes: (1) link in HTML
header to a file containing consent requests; or (2) Script that calls
the consent-request API and passes the information. The websites
determine which purposes they want to use, where users (and user-agents)
are required to be aware of the terms (and their variance) to enable
expression of consent/object decisions. In absence of this, every
website could implement ADPC with its own special customised purpose,
thus creating information comprehension and management overload for
users, especially when websites change terms or users have to manage it
for every website individually. A pragmatic solution would be using an
existing common specification - the IAB’s TCF<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.
However, the TCF has known issues <span class="citation"
data-cites="santosAreCookieBanners2020a vealeAdtechRealTimeBidding2021 vealeImpossibleAsksCan2022"><a
href="#ref-vealeAdtechRealTimeBidding2021" role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a>,
<a href="#ref-vealeImpossibleAsksCan2022" role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a>,
<a href="#ref-santosAreCookieBanners2020a"
role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></span> and cannot be customised by
websites or users.</p>
<p>To rectify this, the first proposed solution consists of three
incrementally radical proposals: (1) giving users control over TCF; (2)
giving users and websites freedom to use any purpose - and matching them
semantically; and (3) creating a globally standardised mechanism for
establishing interoperability between purposes.</p>
<h3 id="applying-adpc-to-iabs-tcf-v2">Applying ADPC to IAB’s TCF v2</h3>
<p>TCF v2 is a specification dedicated to the sharing of personal data
with IAB-defined purposes. The TCF string is effectively a JSON-like
policy encoded in Base64 that consists of additional info than just
purposes - e.g. it also specifies parties, data categories, legal
basess. Given that ADPC only defines purposes as a single-field, and
that users may want to express preferences for each of TCF’s granular
fields, the entirety of TCF’s bit-string can be specified as a single
purpose that can then be consented or objected to. For (a simplified)
example, the identifier <code>1A2B3C</code> can be the id of purpose
<code>1A</code> that uses data <code>2B</code> for controller
<code>3C</code>. Users can selectively (through their user-agent)
configure ADPC to permit or reject specific parts of the TCF, such as
prohibiting all uses of data <code>2B</code> or consenting only to
controller <code>3C</code>. This approach enables to utilising existing
ecosystems of TCF with ADPC’s signal expression, and allows existing
websites and ad-mechanisms to continue operating, and provides users
with more transparency and control of their choices instead of it being
obfuscated in a cookie.</p>
<p>Since the TCF is already optimised for transmission (as binary
encoding), a further optimised version can be developed by removing
irrelevant fields (e.g. timestamps, metrics) for transmission through
HTTP headers. The matching between a TCF-expressed request and
user-expressed preference can also be made performant e.g. based on the
complexity of matching, two bloom filters may suffice to simply check
whether the user has expressed any preference over permitting or
prohibiting an item (e.g. purpose) in the current request.</p>
<h3 id="using-dpv-for-interoperability-between-adpc-purposes">Using DPV
for Interoperability between ADPC purposes</h3>
<p>One of the challenges with effective use of ADPC’s purposes is that
is necessitates websites and user(-agents) to agree upon the vocabulary
to correctly interpret the purposes. To enable some flexibility in this
where websites and users can select their individual purposes and
preferences, which are then semantically matched with each other to
determine whether the action is permitted or prohibited. This is based
on P3P’s design for matching user-preferences with website requests.</p>
<p>For ADPC, the proposal is to use (something similar to) the Data
Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) <span class="citation"
data-cites="panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"><a
href="#ref-panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[30]</a></span> - which provides hierarchical
taxonomies of purposes, personal data, legal bases, and other relevant
concepts. DPV’s taxonomies enable one party (e.g. user) to define their
preferences at an abstract or broad level (e.g. prohibit marketing),
while the other party (e.g. website) can be specific for their use-case
(e.g. request sending newsletters of new products). The receiving party
(e.g. web browser) then performs a semantic matching that involves
inferring that the request to send newsletters is prohibited by the
preference to not receive any marketing, and therefore undertake consent
refusal / withdrawal or express objection. This works in favour of both
websites - that are required to utilise specific purposes, and users -
that can set preferences at a broad level and avoid repetitive
consenting decisions.</p>
<p>To enable the above within ADPC, requests must contain two pieces of
information: the purpose as requested by the controller and the parent
concept it is expanded from, e.g.
<code>Send Newsletters :: Marketing</code>. In this only the top or
parent concept needs to be known or interoperable between the website
and user-agent, thereby reducing the requirement for shared purposes,
and permitting the creation or utilisation of taxonomies like DPV that
provide a broad structure of purposes.</p>
<p>The DPV may not be suitable for use in HTTP transmission due to a
larger byte-size. Here, an approach similar to the compression utilised
by TCF can be developed where a binary expression can be created by
converting DPV to a ‘flat list’ and assigning identifiers (e.g. top
concept is 0, next concept is 1, etc. using the Shannong-Fano encoding<a
href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>).</p>
<p>Using DPV is beneficial as its taxonomy is richer than TCF, more
flexible in that multiple purposes can be cleanly combined and retain
individuality (i.e. multiple parent concepts), and has granularity of
requests and decision management.</p>
<h3 id="a-global-shared-registry-of-purposes">A Global Shared Registry
of Purposes</h3>
<p>The previous two approaches assumed that the website and user-agent
have a mutual understanding on which vocabulary to use. In practicality,
it may be difficult to reach agreement on a single such vocabulary given
the differences in domain, sector, application, jurisdiction, and
actors. To avoid a constant struggle over which vocabulary should be
used, and to avoid/prevent a single restricted vocabulary such as TCF
being the only available vocabulary, a globally standardised registry of
‘purposes’ could be established under a neutral umbrella e.g. by W3C.
The registry (and its shepherd organisation) is then responsible for
maintaining the list of vocabularies conforming to some specified
standards, requirements, or norms - with legal enforceability
necessitating use of only registered vocabularies to avoid misuse.</p>
<p>Use of registered vocabularies is similar to previous proposals - as
a specification expressed in binary form similar to TCF usage to enable
an optimised expression. For example, consider 4-byte words:
<code>0110 1110 1010 0111</code> where the first 8 bits indicate the
identifier of registered vocabulary used
(<code>0110 1110 = 108 of 127</code>), with the vocabulary then
specifying how the following 8 (or more) bits should be interpreted. If
vocabulary 127 was TCF, then the user-agent would interpret the next 8
bits as defined by TCF’s specification in the registry e.g. as each bit
indicating permission for a purpose in the list (same as existing use of
TCF).</p>
<p>The creation of vocabularies at a standardisation organisation (e.g.
W3C) offers advantage in the form establishing governance procedures
where authorities, NGOs, etc. can have the ability to specify additional
information/requirements at the purpose level. For example, saying
<code>x</code> purpose in a list <em>must</em> require explicit consent,
or that <code>y</code> <em>must not</em> be used with legitimate
interest.</p>
<p>Such a global registry can also maintain ‘mappings’ between
vocabularies that permit websites to request using a vocabulary (e.g.
TCF) and match it with user preferences in another (e.g. DPV). This can
enable websites and user-agents to communicate in the language they deem
suitable without requiring strict restrictions on communication.</p>
<h2 id="generating-dialogues-on-user-side">Generating Dialogues on
User-side</h2>
<p>For UI/UX or HCI issues, they are directly associated with how
information is presented, what and how choices are offered, and how
consenting takes place (e.g. dark patterns). To rectify this, the second
proposed solution consists of some or all of the consenting interface
being generated and managed at the user-side by the user-agent of choice
(e.g. web browser or external provider).</p>
<p>To better understand the implications of these solutions, a common
acceptance of the terms associated with different interface elements is
necessary. For the puropses of this paper: a ‘notice’ is the entire
interface which contains information; ‘notice elements’ are parts of a
notice, ‘controls’ are actionable elements meant to be interacted with
by the user (e.g. more info, select choice), and ‘dialogue’ refers to
the entire interface consisting of notice and controls. Controls can be
further distinguished as: ‘layer controls’ refers to controls associated
with varying interface elements in terms of information density,
granularity, presentation, etc.; ‘preference controls’ refer to the user
expressing a preference - where it is important to note that a
preference is not a final decision e.g. checkboxes vs accept button; and
‘decision controls’ that convey the decision of the user e.g.
accept/reject button.</p>
<h3 id="complete-generation">Complete Generation</h3>
<p>The first approach consists of the controller providing all the
necessary information in a machine-readable format (e.g. via ADPC), and
receiving the user’s decision (e.g. true/false). The user-agent
generates the interface and presents the information and controls to the
user.</p>
<p>The information conveyed could be based on standardised
specifications, such as those based on GDPR’s Art.13 and Art.14, and
using mechanisms such as the DPV <span class="citation"
data-cites="panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"><a
href="#ref-panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[30]</a></span> for interoperable communication of
<em>Purpose, Processing, Personal Data, Controller, Recipients, Legal
Basis, and Tech/Org Measures</em>.</p>
<p>Even though the user-agent generates the dialogue on user-side, the
controller can still be provided with some (limited) ability to control
the design and layout of individual elements (e.g. using CSS) - such as
to ensure consistency with website design or to provide additional
emphasis on information. Such access can be restricted to a limited set
of CSS or providing specific rules on elements so as to avoid hiding
elements or changing layouts for manipulation.</p>
<p>This approach avoids the pitfalls related with manipulative designs
and dark patterns, but interestingly also reduces the requirements for
controllers to develop notice and consenting mechanisms themselves. At
the same time, it also works in favour of controllers by reducing their
efforts in developing notice and consent interfaces. However, the caveat
here is that for controllers to respect not generating interfaces or
using the user-agent’s interfaces - a legal intervention is
necessary.</p>
<h3 id="providing-customisable-interfaces">Providing Customisable
Interfaces</h3>
<p>Where the earlier approach proposed completely removing the ability
of controllers to create any consenting interface, this proposal relaxes
this restriction to instead provide a limited ability to generate
interfaces. In this, controllers retain the ability to customise
interfaces i.e. use any HTML structure, but have to use the provided
framework to make requests. The term ‘framework’ refers to some API
provided by the user-agent through which the controller can generate
interfaces and offer choices and controls to the user. For example, as a
standardised JavaScript call <code>createNotice()</code> that takes as
parameters DOM elements containing contents of a notice - such as
options for notice elements, controls, styling, etc. Like before, the
final consenting decision controls are offered by the user-agent.</p>
<p>This approach permits more flexibility to controllers to express
notices and dialogues in granular form, in a way that they determine,
with their own styling. The only caveat is that they have to explicitly
structure their interfaces and processes to conform with the APIs
offered. This enables user-agents to rectify or correct known issues
such as disparity in consenting choices or use of layers to ‘hide’
information. This also enables users to request consent interfaces look
or behave in a certain way by controlling the use of APIs themselves
e.g. by asking the user-agent to display all elements in a single screen
instead of as layers.</p>
<h3 id="only-generating-choices-and-expression">Only Generating Choices
and Expression</h3>
<p>The final proposal is a vastly reduced condition where the user-agent
only generates the choices and controls within an interface - which
might prove to be more palatable to controllers as they retain complete
control of what they want to show and how. However, to avoid some forms
of dark patterns, such as the user not having the ability to discern
between choices, or being forced to interact and make a decision - the
user-agent requires the controller to request consent via an API call.
This is similar to the way websites can currently request access to and
use microphones or cameras through the browser or on the smartphone.</p>
<p>An example of this could be: calling the JavaScript API
<code>requestConsent(html_element_id)</code> where the HTML element ID
refers to the ID of DOM element containing the notice and choice
elements. As before, the final decision elements are generated user-side
and are not available for manipulation by the controller.</p>
<p>While this provides controller the ability to control how they want
to make a request (and use dark patterns), the final decision making
capability is specified by the user. A more granular iteration of this
option is the requirement to make controllers also use the API calls to
specify other controls (e.g. checkboxes) so as to prohibit manipulation
of any form in making choices.</p>
<h3 id="use-of-adpc-and-quality-of-consent">Use of ADPC, and Quality of
Consent</h3>
<p>In all options, ADPC (as defined) takes on a more passive role, where
it can act as the bearer of information required to generate a dialogue,
or for communicating the decisions made by the user. However, the
proposals presented in this paper also work towards enabling consenting
interfaces, such as through the use of standardised and interoperable
vocabularies that can be useful in generated consenting interfaces
programmatically.</p>
<p>This opens up an interesting aspect of research regarding the
‘quality of consent’ - e.g. regular or explicit as defined by the GDPR.
The user-agent could utilise the vocabularies and known norms (e.g.
special categories require explicit consent) to automatically present
the appropriate level of information and choices to the user. Not only
is this beneficial for enforcement of the law (i.e. GDPR) as intended,
it helps users in making them more aware of when sensitive decisions are
needed, and is better for controllers to avoid incorrect or
non-compliant interfaces.</p>
<h3 id="semantic-markup-in-html-documents">Semantic Markup in HTML
documents</h3>
<p>Further use of vocabularies is that they can also be used as semantic
markup within the HTML or externally as machine-readalbe policies.
Existing proposals<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> for this include embedding semantic
markup alongside the HTML elements so that the user-agent can identify
the notice elements and assist in the requesting and decision making
process. This can be the source of information required for some of the
proposed approaches above with the HTML existing as a fallback in case
the user-agent does not support ADPC. In this, the explored approach
consists of specifying ‘notice’ using the <code>dialog</code> HTML
element, customising buttons/choices by identifying them using semantic
markup (e.g. button type as providing consent); and indicating action or
application or information using <code>data-*</code> attributes (e.g.
<code>data-purpose</code> indicating the text following the element is
the purpose of processing).</p>
<p>A semantic markup mechanism already exists in the form of <a
href="schema.org" class="uri">schema.org</a> which provides metadata for
websites to declare their contents to search-engines and other
web-crawlers. However, despite aiming to offer rich semantic markup for
websites, it lacks relevant concepts to represent important information
such as privacy policies, t&amp;c, entities and roles (e.g. controller),
dialogues and interfaces, consent, preferences, etc. Therefore,
alongside the creation of vocabularies and user-side generation of
dialogues, a tangential proposal also includes the further development
of HTML elements as identified earlier and accompanying semantic markup
within schema.org so they can be used in HTML to identify notice
elements and its contents e.g. to indicate which button is consent
action. Where some of these concepts could be deemed to not be in scope
for schema.org, they could be explored to be alternately expressed using
another vocabulary such as the DPV <span class="citation"
data-cites="panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"><a
href="#ref-panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[30]</a></span>.</p>
<h2
id="discussion-on-practicality-and-feasibility-in-real-world">Discussion
on Practicality and Feasibility in Real-World</h2>
<p>This section discusses important questions in terms of the practical
application of proposed approaches, the history of similar approaches
facing resilience from actors historically, as well the difficulties
associated with making such approaches legally required and
enforceable.</p>
<p><strong>Controllers:</strong> While the proposed approaches make it
more difficult for controllers to indulge in malpractices, this must be
taken as a benefit in terms of lesser legal liability rather than a
hindrance in terms of lesser data sourcing. Additionally, giving users
more control may open new opportunities to build relationships based on
trust rather than coercion. However, in practice, controllers may still
largely rely on third-party tools such as CMPs and services such as
TCF/RTB given the prevalent use of advertisements on websites.
Therefore, effective adoption for controllers may be entirely determined
by available support in third-party tooling. This creates a risk that
proposed solutions might be rejected, diluted, or convoluted to not be
effective by such third-party platforms.</p>
<p><strong>User-Agents:</strong> User-agent here refers mainly to web
browsers (i.e. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and
Microsoft Edge) and smartphone platform OS providers (Apple’s iOS family
and Google’s Android). Of these, Google and Microsoft have a conflict of
interest in developing such technologies given their reliance on data
harvesting and ad-based revenues. For example, Chrome, despite being the
dominant browser, is the last in terms of adopting beneficial approaches
such as third-party cookie restrictions, but the first to offer counter
proposals such as Federated Learning of Cohorts<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
(FLoC). Collectively, the browsers have also been reluctant to improve
the state of privacy-based approaches on the web as related to
consenting - as evidenced by lack of related proposals or work in web
communities. In addition, there is a culture of implementing things
in-house, such as Apple’s App Tracking Transparency<a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>
(ATT), instead of having a collective standardised approach.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> The proposed approaches promise several
benefits to users ranging from lesser consenting decisions to more
empowerment and better management of their relationships with
controllers. However, for true effectiveness, the approaches have to be
implemented by user-agents that the users commonly use and expect to
work on their behalf. This is problematic because the users now face an
unexpected hurdle in that they are at the mercy of their user-agents in
terms of what options and abilities are made available to them. Given
the historical basis for how user-agents (see prior para) have not
provided any means to alleviate consenting issues, users are at a
different end of power imbalance - a surprising outcome from the
development of user-empowerment approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Data Protection Authorities (DPAs):</strong> Authorities
exist to enforce the law, which means that their powers, abilities, and
perspectives are largely shaped within the confines of what the law
declares and permits. However, authorities are also agencies in their
own right, as evidenced from their lack of effective enforcement under
the GDPR. While some of this can be attributed to lack of resources, the
complexities of enforcing a new regulation, or the large difference in
capabilities between DPAs and multi-national organisations, at the end
of the day - DPAs have the power to validate solutions that they deem
enforceable. While European DPAs have been reluctant to provide any
reassuring endorsement to a particular solution, the Californian
authority has been notable in being proactive regarding development and
enforcement of technological solutions - most notably the GPC. Despite
California being a smaller non-national jurisdiction and CCPA being
vastly smaller than the more complex GDPR, it asserts how DPAs endorsing
technological solutions can fast-track their adoption and effectiveness
in legal enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Enforceability:</strong> For solutions to be enforced,
they are required to have a basis in law, such as a statement indicating
applicability of a category of solutions. For example: GDPR’s Art.21-5
specifically mentione “data subject may exercise his or her right to
object by automated means using technical specifications.”. Here, the
exact nature of “technical specification” is not defined, and is open to
interpretation by the courts and DPAs, but it can be taken to refer to
any automated solution e.g. a signal such as ADPC. Despite this, the
enforceability of a signal is still an open question as no DPA has
confirmed what criteria must be fulfilled for a signal, as automated
means, to be considered enforceable. There seems to be a reluctance to
await adoption and support from the same stakeholders which cause issues
- thereby resulting in an enforcement paralysis and a technological
stagnation in terms of legally enforceable solutions. Though there are
upcoming proposals that aim to change things, notably EU’s Data Services
Act<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> (DSA) and the ePrivacy Regulation<a
href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> (ePR) - their current drafts (as of
MAR’22) do not provide any further clarity or ability for the use of
proposed solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Standardisation:</strong> For solutions to be generally
adopted, it is essential for them to be standardised (whether formally
or informally). However, the standardisation body itself does not
necessarily act on its own agency. For example, IAB is a consortium made
up of members who have a vested interest in advertising-based profit,
and thereby a conflict on interest in any solution that reduces their
capabilities. Similarly, W3C, while a web-focused body, comprises of
members which include Google, Facebook, Apple, etc. that make up most of
the web development task forces. While this can be mitigated through
wider community participation, e.g. by NGOs, or by researchers - it is
difficult to sustain such initiatives given the disparity between
available human resources and funding.</p>
<p><strong>Way Forward:</strong> While each of the prior topics was
critical in that it presented barriers to the adoption of proposed
solutions, it also opens discussion for overcoming these hurdles. The
largest mechanism for adoption of proposed solutions is the ability for
user-agents to express them, which necessitates development within web
browsers (primarily) and smartphone platforms. This can be done through
the W3C working and community groups dedicated to development of
privacy-based features, with legal and societal backing to avoid
reluctance by big-tech. At the same time, the lack of motivation stems
from lesser legal enforcement and clarity - which needs to be addressed
in upcoming proposals explicitly. For this, additional work
demonstrating why laws and DPAs need to be progressive regarding
technological solutions for enforcement is desperately needed. Finally,
the proposed research is theoretical, and needs to be implemented in
real-world conditions as prototypes to demonstrate its effectiveness and
ability to function. For this, collaborations are needed to ensure
adequate stakeholder representation (e.g. users, user-agents, and
websites). Forums such as community groups<a href="#fn18"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>
provide a common ground for finding and exploiting such
opportunities.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This paper presented two sets of radical proposals associated with
issues regarding consenting it identified from the existing literature.
The first proposal dealt with automated communication of information and
decisions based on the ADPC specification, which addressed consent
fatigue, user decision-making, and misuse of consenting. The second
proposal consisted of generating consenting interfaces at the user-side
by the user-agent through different variations of control available to
the controller. It aimed to resolve issues regarding dark patterns,
manipulation, coercion, and lack of control by users in consenting.</p>
<p>To address how these proposals face hurdles in real-world adoption,
the paper presented a discussion section that provided a critical
overlook of how the different actors have been historically reluctant to
adopt such solutions. In conclusion, it identified promise in the
upcoming European legal proposals for technological approaches and
solutions taking a more active role in effective consenting and its
enforcement by all actors.</p>
