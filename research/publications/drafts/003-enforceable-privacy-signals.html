        <h2 id="definition-of-privacy-signals."><strong>Definition of Privacy
signals.</strong> </h2>
<p>Privacy signals are digital representations that allow users to
communicate their preferences [1] [2][3][4] of how users want their
personal data to be processed, e.g. Do Not Track [5][6] for opting out
of tracking, Global Privacy Control (GPC) [7] for opting out of third
party sharing, IAB’s Transparency and Consent (TCF) signal [8] for
communicating decisions), or exercise rights (e.g. Art.21(5) GDPR), and
can be automated and customised for the websites they visit.</p>
<p>Privacy signals must be adopted by both sides of the communication,
i.e., controllers and data subjects along with support from device or
software providers. Signals have the advantage to create a level playing
field between all actors (users, websites, third parties), and to avoid
user consent to be exploited through deceptive interfaces (dark
patterns) [4][9] that nudge users to accept tracking though ubiquitous
consent banners where consent where consent cannot be ‘informed’ or
‘freely given’.</p>
<p>The idea of automated signals is not new in the GDPR. Article 21(5)
thereof already envisaged that users could exercise their “right to
object to processing” by using automated signals, however, this
provision was never implemented, neither a process to designate a signal
was included in the GDPR [10].</p>
<h2
id="the-idea-of-enforceability-of-signals-has-been-posited-by-several-stakeholders."><strong>The
idea of enforceability of signals has been posited by several
stakeholders.</strong> </h2>
<p>Several stakeholders confirm that the choices made by users when
establishing the privacy settings of a browser (or other application)
should be <em>binding on, and enforceable against any all parties</em>.
The explanatory Memorandum of the ePrivacy Directive [11] stated that
“<em>centralising consent in software and prompting users with
information about the privacy settings thereof</em>”, is effective to
empower users and to avoid overload of consent requests. Thus, browser
(and comparable software) settings have a role to play in avoiding
consent fatigue. The ePrivacy Directive (ePD) already referred in its
Recital 66 that the user's consent may be expressed by using the
appropriate settings of a browser or other application. The ePrivacy
Regulation proposal refers, in the versions of the Commission,
Parliament and Council, the possibility for signals to exist through
technical settings of a software, though its current stalemate does not
yet define signals as legally binding. The Parliament, in Article
10(1a), made signals legally binding [12]. The Council [13] (Article
4a(2aa) and Recital 20a) says that “<em>consent directly expressed by an
end-user</em>” (which we understand it is consent collected via a
consent pop-up on each specific website) shall prevail over
“<em>software settings</em>” (which we interpret as allowing the user to
set a consent in a Web browser preferences). This position is
problematic [14]: i) it would disadvantage privacy-friendly browsers
that do provide data protection by default, ii) it would not help reduce
users repeated and overloading exposure to consent banners [15], nor
protect them against the manipulative practices deployed in such banners
to deceive users to give consent to be tracked and profiled
[9][16][17].</p>
<p>Stakeholders strongly advocate for legally binding signals, such as
BEUC [14][18], EDPB [19], the former Article 29 Working Party [20],
Access Now, NOYB and EDRI [21]. California’s CCPA, in Art. §999.315
became the first law to require compliance with automated signals and to
endorse a specific signal (GPC[7]) and on 2022, its enforcement agency
fined Sephora for not honoring GPC [22] - the first such action of its
kind.</p>
<h2
id="who-decides-which-signal-is-enforceable-or-must-be-mandatory"><strong>Who
decides which signal is enforceable or must be mandatory?</strong> </h2>
<p>Article 19(1)(ba) of the Parliament’s draft [12] allocated the
technical rule-making procedure to an independent supervisory authority.
The Open Rights Group [10] stated that the EDPB should take the task of
defining the requirements and technical specifications for signals to
communicate and withdraw consent, and to object to processing based on
legitimate interest. The proposal from Access Now, NOYB and EDRI [21]
mentioned that these signals could be developed and made legally binding
via delegated acts by the European Commission, after a positive binding
opinion of the EDPB.</p>
<p>Any future enforceable legal provision on signals needs to bring
clarity regarding the technical features of signals (identification of
users, update of signals, etc.) and possible conflicts [2] between
signals as users unintentionally express conflicting or ambiguous
preferences and transmit more than one signal, either at individual
website or browser levels, which creates uncertainty over how legal
rules apply (e.g. websites specifying conflicting decisions through TCF,
DNT, GPC, or ADPC signals.</p>
<h2
id="examples-of-privacy-signals-in-the-wild-and-its-problems."><strong>Examples
of privacy signals in the wild and its problems.</strong> </h2>
<p>Despite their clear benefits, privacy signals have failed to be:</p>
<p>(1) adopted by stakeholders such as advertisers who have competing
vested interests [23];</p>
<p>(2) standardised for commonality and interoperability (e.g., Platform
for Privacy Preferences (P3P)[24] and DNT);</p>
<p>(3) made compatible with legal requirements, and</p>
<p>(4) enforced by legal authorities. </p>
<p>Of the current efforts, IAB’s TCF signal [3][16] is adopted by
hundreds of ad-tech vendors and thousands of websites in the EU, despite
its lawfulness being questioned by the Belgian Data Protection Authority
[25]. GPC, active within USA, has been adopted by web browsers (e.g.,
Firefox, DuckDuckGo, Brave), consent management platforms, and service
providers (e.g., The Washington Post), and includes applications for
GDPR to “restrict third-party data sharing” [7]. Advanced Data
Protection Control (ADPC) [26], developed by NOYB, focuses specifically
on GDPR requirements regarding consent and right to object. The legality
of both GPC and ADPC for EU has been untested.</p>
<h2 id="what-could-be-automated"><strong>What could be
automated?</strong> </h2>
<p>Signals can be used to automate and communicate decisions (e.g.,
user’s consent refusal) or rights. Currently, only Art.21(5) GDPR
mentions automation for the right to object. We discuss the potential
for signals to automate other relevant events.</p>
<p><em>Granting informed and specific consent</em>.</p>
<p>The TCF automates the communication of decisions (accept/refuse)
though it can only be communicated by authorized agents such as CMPs.
ADPC also provides automated communication of decisions, and
additionally proposes creating “automated means for users to give or
refuse consent” through management interfaces e.g., through a web
browser. However, Recital 32 requires “acceptance of the proposed
processing” by users. Accordingly, signals must explicitly refer to the
“proposed processing” to automate decisions and include the information
of Art.13, 14, e.g., processing purposes, identity of controllers etc.
In such cases, signals can provide a priori information about possible
<em>choices</em> which must then be confirmed by the user. Practically,
this could mean preconfiguring consent requests (either under Articles
6(1)(a) GDPR and 5(3) ePD (consent to terminal access) to such
preferences to make it convenient for users to express their decision(s)
which can be done if the signal supports granularity for different
purposes, data categories, etc.</p>
<p><em>Withdrawal of consent</em><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>GDPR Art.7(3) specifies “It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give
consent”. Signals can (be made to) automate withdrawals irrespective of
whether granting can be automated. Signals can provide automation of
withdrawal at varying levels of granularity, e.g., for all or only
specific purposes or controllers. TCF does not support communication of
withdrawal, while ADPC supports both communication and automation of
exercising withdrawal.</p>
<p><em>Right to object to legitimate interests.</em></p>
<p>Art. 21(5) GDPR acknowledges the use of “automated means using
technical specifications” to object to “legitimate interests”. This is
important given the current practice of misusing legitimate interests
within consent interfaces and making it difficult to object to their use
[27]. TCF supports communication of objections, while ADPC supports both
communication and automation of exercising objections.</p>
<p><em>Automating the exercise of other rights</em>.</p>
<p>Signals can be used to automate several actions associated with
exercising rights, as GDPR Rec.59 states “The controller should also
provide means for requests to be made electronically, especially where
personal data are processed by electronic means”. This can mean using
signals to communicate information or a link to further information
regarding GDPR Art.12-22 in order to facilitate easier access as well as
exercising of these rights.</p>
<h2>Concluding Remarks</h2>
<p>The impetus of providing a legally binding and enforceable signal is
now in the hands of the legislators. Through this article, we have
initiated an important conversation that points to the existence of
signals, their basis in other laws outside EU as well as successful
legal enforcement, and the path forward to ensure such signals provide
benefits through technological automation while upholding the rights and
freedoms of users without detriment.</p>
