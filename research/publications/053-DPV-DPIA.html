<p><strong>Abstract</strong> The GDPR requires assessing and conducting a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for processing of personal data that may result in high risk and impact to the data subjects. Documenting this process requires information about processing activities, entities and their roles, risks, mitigations and resulting impacts, and consultations. Impact assessments are complex activities where stakeholders face difficulties to identify relevant risks and mitigations, especially for emerging technologies and specific considerations in their use-cases, and to document outcomes in a consistent and reusable manner. We address this challenge by utilising linked-data to represent DPIA related information so that it can be better managed and shared in an interoperable manner. For this, we consulted the guidance documents produced by EU Data Protection Authorities (DPA) regarding DPIA and by ENISA regarding risk management. The outcome of our efforts is an extension to the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) for documenting DPIAs and an ontology for risk management based on ISO 31000 family of standards. Our contributions fill an important gap within the state of the art, and paves the way for shared impact assessments with future regulations such as for AI and Cybersecurity.</p>

<h2 id="sec:intro">Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="sec:intro-background">Motivation</h3>
<p>The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <span
class="citation" data-cites="Regulation_GDPR"><a
href="#ref-Regulation_GDPR" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span> requires
every Data Controller to assess and document whether their processing is
“likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms” of
individuals (i.e. <em>high-risk</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>), and if so - to carry
out a ‘Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)’. A DPIA is essentially
a three-step iterative risk governance process where the organisation
first identifies its activities, then checks whether any DPIA-requiring
criteria is met, and if yes - conduct a DPIA (see more in ). GDPR does
not impose a strict process for how organisations have to conduct their
risk and impact assessments, but instead specifies only broad
requirements. Data Protection Authorities (DPA), tasked with enforcing
GDPR, have published (on respective websites) guidance and tools related
to compliance, including DPIA and risk governance.</p>
<p>We identify five important challenges regarding DPIAs present in the
current landscape that serve as motivation for this work. (1) DPIAs can
involve multiple stakeholders (e.g. Data Processors) which creates
information dependencies (e.g. measures implemented by processors). (2)
Since DPIAs must be specific, controllers conducting similar DPIAs will
repeat information and tasks. (3) Despite existing standards for risk
management, there is variance in methodologies that prevents common
universal solutions. (4) Current documentation norms are heavily
human-oriented (e.g. spreadsheets, PDF), which severely limit
development and application of tools for DPIAs. (5) Solutions do not
take into account that high-risk impact assessments are a form of shared
activity i.e. they share processing activity information, risks, and
impacts with other GDPR requirements (e.g. Register of Processing
Activities (ROPA), data transfers), and have overlaps with similar
assessments in aligned regulations, e.g. the EU’s proposal for AI Act
<span class="citation" data-cites="EU_AI_Reg"><a href="#ref-EU_AI_Reg"
role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span>.</p>
<p>The state of the art contains multifaceted application-specific
solutions for expressing risks, DPIA methodologies, and GDPR compliance.
In particular, they demonstrate advantages of semantic web technologies
for: (i) specialising for a use-case; (ii) interoperability between
stakeholders and tools; (iii) creating shared knowledge-bases; and (iv)
developing tooling for machine-based compliance. However, there are two
important gaps that have not been addressed: impact assessments and
documenting DPIAs.</p>
<h3 id="sec:intro-contributions">Contributions of this Work</h3>
<p>We take the first step towards improving the DPIA processes by
enabling sharing and reuse of information required for risk/impact
assessments through the use of semantic web technologies. Our approach
reflects the positioning of DPIAs within a broader framework of
information and compliance management associated with GDPR. Thus, rather
than creating an ontology solely dedicated to representing DPIA, we
extend an existing ontology - the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) produced
by the Data Privacy Vocabularies and Controls Community Group<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> (DPVCG) as the state of the art (see
). DPV provides a comprehensive taxonomy of data processing related
concepts, including rudimentary concepts for risks and DPIA, that are
meant to be jurisdiction and domain agnostic, with a separate extension
(<code>dpv-gdpr</code>) providing GDPR specific concepts. We identified
and proposed concepts currently missing in (core) DPV, and from these
developed a DPIA specification as an extension (called
<code>DPV-DPIA</code>). For expressing risk/impact assessments - we
developed an ontology based on the ISO 31000 family of risk-related
standards. For expressing impacts to fundamental rights and freedoms, we
created a thesauri from the EU Charter regarding rights and freedoms<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>To ensure the specification is useful and practical for stakeholders,
we based it on DPA guidelines and tools to first ensure important
requirements are met (see ). We then modelled real-world instances of
(publicly available) DPIAs as a form of reflective evaluation, and to
demonstrate sharing of knowledge we used the DPV-specified concepts
within French DPA’s (CNIL) DPIA tool (see ). We conclude with a
discussion (see ) on identified and perceived limitations of our work,
and the pragmatism of developing shared impact assessments for EU’s
regulatory landscape.</p>
<p>To summarise, our major contributions are: (i) Machine-readable DPIA
specification; and (ii) Enabling reuse and sharing of risks,
mitigations, and impacts through linked data. Minor contributions
include: (i) Risk ontology based on ISO 31000 family of standards; (ii)
Thesauri of EU fundamental rights and freedoms; (iii) Collection of
risks, mitigations, and impacts from literature; (iv) Extension of DPV
and state of the art; and (v) Practical discussions towards developing
shared impact assessments.</p>
<h2 id="sec:sota">Background and State of the Art</h2>
<h3 id="sec:sota-gdpr">GDPR and Data Protection Impact Assessments
(DPIA)</h3>
<p>GDPR’s Article 35 prescribes requirements for assessing necessity of
DPIAs based on potential for high-risk, and for carrying out a DPIA if a
criteria is met. In this, it describes conditions that always need a
DPIA and lays down the basis where DPAs can specify further rules on
conditions that do/don’t require DPIA. It also describes consultation of
stakeholders such as Data Protection Officers (DPO) and data subjects
where necessary.</p>
<p>In order to determine necessity, controllers require descriptions of
processing activities in terms of specific criteria, for example the
scale and scope of data (Art.35-3b), or whether automated decision
making and profiling operations are involved (Art.35-3a). DPA guidelines
provide additional nuanced descriptions of concepts that are relevant
for determining risk, impact, and the basis on which DPIAs should be
conducted.</p>
<p>While GDPR intends to provide harmonised requirements for DPIAs,
individual DPAs have taken different approaches with deviations
regarding use of organisational processes related to management
practices and risk governance - which are not necessarily directly
associated with a DPIA. For example, as part of the DPIA templates, both
AEPD (Spanish DPA) and CNIL (French DPA) ask about the organisation’s
“internal practices and context” which includes “ organisation’s
structure, functions and competencies, adopted policies, norms and
standards, organisational maturity objectives and in general the
organisation’s culture”. Owing to this, organisations have difficulties
in determining what requirements a DPIA must meet given that the
guidance is varied, complex, nuanced, and difficult to judge for
sufficiency. Additionally, Georgiadis et al. <span class="citation"
data-cites="georgiadisPrivacyImpactAssessment2022"><a
href="#ref-georgiadisPrivacyImpactAssessment2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span> conducted a systemic literature
review on the different privacy and data protection risks specified
within the state of the art, with a conclusion on the necessity to
further develop better DPIA methodologies due to organisation’s limited
knowledge on this topic.</p>
<h3 id="sec:sota-semweb">Models for DPIAs and Risk Assessments</h3>
<p>There are several domain and application specific approaches for
modelling risk in ontological form. Some examples are: Agrawal’s <span
class="citation" data-cites="agrawalOntologyISOIEC2016"><a
href="#ref-agrawalOntologyISOIEC2016"

risks and harms. While these approaches model risk concepts in
ontological form, they focus on organisational perspective of risks
(e.g. economic), or on generalised concepts (e.g. philosophical) that
are not sufficient for expressing impacts as needed for a DPIA.</p>
<p>In approaches that represent DPIA related information, GDPRtEXT <span
class="citation" data-cites="panditGDPRtEXTGDPRLinked2018"><a
href="#ref-panditGDPRtEXTGDPRLinked2018"
role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a></span> provides insufficient concepts
related to DPIA. PrOnto <span class="citation"
data-cites="palmiraniPrOntoPrivacyOntology2018"><a
href="#ref-palmiraniPrOntoPrivacyOntology2018"
role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span> specifies DPIA as a workflow with
steps and different categorisations of risk. Data Privacy Vocabulary<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> (DPV) <span class="citation"
data-cites="panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"><a
href="#ref-panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></span> provides comprehensive taxonomies
for describing personal data processing activities, which includes DPIA
and risk concepts. In approaches related to automating DPIA processes,
Dashti et al. <span class="citation"
data-cites="dashtiAutomatedRiskAssessment2021"><a
href="#ref-dashtiAutomatedRiskAssessment2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a></span> explore automation of DPIA based on
rule-based mechanisms to identify alternatives for less risky
implementations. And Saniei <span class="citation"
data-cites="sanieiChallengesImplementationPrivacy2021"><a
href="#ref-sanieiChallengesImplementationPrivacy2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[13]</a></span> proposes use of semantic web
technologies to represent DPIA related knowledge and to use rules and
inferences to identify relevant obligations and actions, with ongoing
work <span class="citation"
data-cites="sanieiDataProtectionImpact2021"><a
href="#ref-sanieiDataProtectionImpact2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></span> in collecting competency questions
and creating a vocabulary - which was useful for this work.</p>
<p>Of these approaches, none provided all necessary concepts or could be
readily used. Of these, DPV was the most suitable choice to extend given
that it is: (a) most comprehensive; (b) open access; (c) has a mechanism
for updating through DPVCG. This finding is backed by a recent survey by
Esteves et al <span class="citation"
data-cites="estevesAnalysisOntologiesPolicy2022"><a
href="#ref-estevesAnalysisOntologiesPolicy2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[15]</a></span> regarding modelling of GDPR related
information flows that also included DPIA as a factor in investigation,
with favourable reviews for DPV, though it found no suitably complete
vocabulary for DPIAs.</p>
<h2 id="sec:spec">DPIA Specification</h2>
<h3 id="sec:spec-req">Requirements and Objectives</h3>
<p>For understanding DPIA information requirements, we utilised EU DPA
provided guidelines, tools, and templates. For non-English documents, we
utilised machine-translation to convert them, and manually inspected
them for correctness (relying on the author’s familiarity with
information). In particular, we focused on identifying requirements
regarding: (1) personal data processing activities; (2) DPIA necessity
assessment and outcomes; (3) risk/impact assessments and outcome; (4)
conditions regarded as high-risk, and requirement for a DPIA; and (5)
documentation required for maintaining DPIAs.</p>
<p>As outlined earlier in , these documents provide a wide range of
information requirements that do not necessarily relate directly to
DPIAs as stated in GDPR Art.35. In particular, the DPAs from Spain,
France, and UK have provided comprehensive documentation which does not
provide justification for how these are connected to specific legal
requirements, and often go well beyond GDPR and into describing internal
risk and governance procedures. The scope and breadth of these practices
necessitate a much larger study given their complexity, variance, and
connection to legal requirements. We focused on representing relevant
information at a ‘high-level’ while also being sufficient in terms of
GDPR requirements. This led to identifying the following specific
requirements regarding documentation of information: (1) provenance
records for DPIA in terms of processes and actors; (2) representing
risk/impact assessments; (3) description of processing activities; and
(4) risks, mitigations, and impacts.</p>
<h3 id="sec:spec-overview">Specification Overview</h3>
<p>The specification, available online<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>,
models three categories of information: provenance and status of DPIA,
processing activities associated with a DPIA, and the risks/impacts
involved in that DPIA. In this, the existing<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> DPV
concept <code>dpv:DPIA</code> is reused as a focal point with further
specialisation into three aspects: <code>DPIANecessityAssessment</code>
representing determination of whether a DPIA is required;
<code>DPIAProcedure</code> for risks, impacts, and mitigations being
investigated and documented; and <code>DPIAOutcome</code> for
documenting the outcomes of a DPIA in terms of continuation of
processing. <a href="#fig-spec">Figure. 1</a> represents these along with other core concepts to provide
an overview of the specification.</p>
<figure id="fig-spec">
    <img src="img/053-spec.png">
    <figcaption>Overview of the DPIA Specification</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>DPIAs require documentation of provenance information regarding when
it took place (temporal information), and who was involved (agents, e.g.
approval). For these, we reuse Dublin Core Metadata Innovation<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> (DCMI) terms for temporal
information
(<code>dct:created, dct:modified, dct:dateSubmitted, dct:dateAccepted, dct:temporal, dct:valid</code>),
conformance e.g. codes of conduct (<code>dct:conformsTo</code>),
descriptions (<code>dct:title, dct:description</code>), identifier or
version (<code>dct:identifier, dct:isVersionOf</code>), and subject or
scope of DPIA (<code>dct:subject, dct:coverage</code>).</p>
<p>To record outcomes of DPIA processes, we consider a DPIA to be a form
of <em>Audit</em> and use <code>dpv:hasStatus</code> with the
appropriate <code>dpv:AuditStatus</code>. For example,
<code>DPIANecessityAssessment</code> with <code>dpv:AuditRequired</code>
indicates a necessity assessment is required, whereas
<code>DPIAProcedure</code> with <code>dpv:AuditApproved</code> indicates
the DPIA results were approved (e.g. by a DPO). The relation
<code>hasOutcome</code> was created to indicate status of each DPIA
process as - (i) for <code>dpv:DPIANecessityAssessment</code>:
<code>DPIANecessityStatus</code> and specialisations related to whether
a DPIA is required or not-required; (ii) for
<code>dpv:DPIAProcedure</code>: <code>DPIARiskStatus</code> and
specialisations related to level of risk as high, low, or none; and
(iii) for <code>dpv:DPIAOutcome</code>: <code>DPIAOutcomeStatus</code>
and specialisations for whether processing is permitted or prohibited or
consultation is required<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>. These represent the broad outcomes
to be recorded when carrying out a DPIA in terms of whether risks have
been mitigated (or deemed acceptable) and whether processing can (or
cannot) be carried out.</p>
<p>For indicating the different stages and processes in conducting and
managing DPIA, the concepts <code>Audit, Approval, Investigation</code>,
and <code>Review</code> were created with specific relations (e.g.
<code>hasAudit</code>) to associate them with the relevant concepts. For
indicating specific categories of consultations, the existing concept
<code>dpv:Consultation</code> was extended as
<code>ConsultationWithDataSubject</code> and
<code>ConsultationWithDPO</code> to record their views and inputs within
the DPIA process.</p>
<p>For indicating the scope and contents covered within a DPIA, the
property <code>dct:coverage</code> is reused with
<code>dpv:PersonalDataHandling</code> instances to indicate the
specifics of purposes, processing operations, personal data categories,
entities (e.g. controllers, recipients), technical &amp; organisational
measures, legal bases, and other details. Here, <code>dct:subject</code>
can be optionally used to indicate a DPIA (and its associated processing
activities) relate to a specific topic, such as a service or a
product.</p>
<p>The existing risk concepts in DPV are used as: to indicate risks
(<code>dpv:Risk, dpv:hasRisk</code>), mitigations
(<code>dpv:RiskMitigationMeasure, dpv:mitigatesRisk</code>),
consequences (<code>dpv:Consequence, dpv:hasConsequence</code>), and
impacts (<code>dpv:Impact, dpv:hasImpact, dpv:hasImpactOn</code>). For
more specific risk assessment information, such as risk levels and
severity, the ISO 31000 based risk ontology is used.</p>
<h3 id="sec:spec-dpv">Extending DPV</h3>
<p>We found DPV currently has several concepts missing regarding not
only DPIAs, but also those related to descriptions of processing
activities beyond what is needed from a risk/impact perspective. For
example, one of the prominent criteria in determining whether processing
is likely to be high-risk is the understanding of scale and scope
regarding personal data, processing activities, and data subjects.
Rather than specifying their expression only within what is needed for a
DPIA, we consider these concepts to be useful in other tasks and
assessments, and thus propose their inclusion in DPV.</p>
<p>An important addition we propose is the indication of certain
<code>Scale</code> concepts along with commonly used qualitative terms<a
href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> that relates to a measurement of
dimension of some other concept. <code>DataVolume</code> indicates the
scale of personal data being processed with qualifiers (from larger to
smaller in context) -
{<code>Huge, Large, Medium, Small, Sporadic, Singular</code>}.
<code>DataSubjectScale</code> indicates a measurement of the scale of
data subjects with the same qualifiers as data volume.
<code>GeographicScale</code> indicates the geo-physical scale (e.g. for
processing activities or data subjects) as
{<code>Global, NearlyGlobal, MultiNational, National, Regional, Locality, WithinEnvironment</code>}
with the last item referring to instances such as on device. Separate
from scale, we also propose the modelling of <code>Scope</code> as a
concept referring to the <em>extent or range</em> of other concepts such
as processing activities. To differentiate between scale and scope, the
former refers to a <em>measurement</em> such as volume or number whereas
the latter relates to <em>variance</em> such as categories or
dimensions.</p>
<p>Along with scale and scope as new concepts, we also propose
remodelling existing concepts that relate to either. These include
<code>dpv:Frequency</code> which indicates temporal periodicity, and
should be a specialisation of <code>Scale</code> with qualifiers
{<code>Continuous, Often, Sporadic, Singular</code>}. Similarly,
<code>dpv:Duration</code> should also be a specialisation of
<code>Scale</code> with qualifiers
{<code>Endless, TemporalDuration, UntilEvent, UntilTime, FixedOccurences</code>}
to represent the different categories of durations that are utilised
regarding personal data processing activities.</p>
<p>In our analysis of the DPIA documents, a large amount of information
was expected to be recorded in the form of “<em>justification</em>” for
why something was or was not done regarding the requirements set out by
GDPR or DPAs. This information would typically be indicated as a textual
description (i.e. free-form text) accompanying some question or concept.
Given the importance of this concept in legal compliance, and the
necessity to record this information in a form more explicit than (mere)
descriptions, we propose the property <code>hasJustification</code> for
inclusion in DPV. The concept enables associating a textual statement,
or document, or specific concept as the justification for its state or
existence, and is also useful beyond DPIAs - such as for acknowledging
legal compliance obligations or recording a DPO’s statements during an
investigation.</p>
<p>We also identified concepts missing regarding processing operations:
{<code>Access, Assess, Filter, Monitor, Modify, Observe, Screen</code>}
- that refer to specific kinds of actions over personal data relevant
when conducting a DPIA. Other missing concepts relate to certain
categories of purposes, and technical and organisational measures, in
particular those that are relevant in determining whether processing
activities require a DPIA. Similarly, missing concepts were also
identified regarding personal data categories (for the DPV-PD
extension<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>) relating to behavioural,
financial, professional, and in particular their indication as sensitive
and special categories. We have shared these findings with the DPVCG
through the public mailing list<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>
<h3 id="sec:spec-iso">Risk Ontology based on ISO 31000 family of
Documents</h3>
<p>As stated before, DPV offers a few abstract risk-related concepts
that are not sufficient to represent risks, mitigations, consequences,
impacts, and their assessments as required within a DPIA. Additionally,
the state of the art does not provide a suitable risk ontology that can
be used readily or adapted for this work. Due to these reasons, we
initiated development of a risk ontology. For this, we looked towards
existing standardised forms of risk management, but found no consistent
or common modelling of risk or its associated processes. Our experience
revealed a fragmented landscape consisting of often conflicting use of
terms and a high degree of use-case specific solutions within both
academia and industry. The few standardised approaches regarding risk
limited themselves to either providing an organisational perspective of
risk or forced the use of domain-specific terms that raised questions
regarding its usefulness outside those domains.</p>
<p>Within these, the ISO 31000 family of standards provide a set of
harmonised and consensus-building documents that provide guidance,
principles, and vocabularies associated with risk management and risk
governance. Other approaches also exist that are more systematised -
such as the US Government’s NIST Risk Management framework<a
href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <span class="citation"
data-cites="nationalinstituteofstandardsandtechnologyNistPrivacyFramework2020"><a
href="#ref-nationalinstituteofstandardsandtechnologyNistPrivacyFramework2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[16]</a></span>, or are intuitive for businesses -
such as FAIR Risk Management<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>.</p>
<p>We decided to utilise the ISO standards due to their global
applicability, standardised terminology, involvement and alignment with
EU standardisation bodies, and also because one of our future ambitions
is to provide a way for expressing utilisation of ISO standards in
processing activities, e.g. regarding cloud security. Though it must be
noted that the FAIR risk management approach specifies use of an
ontology in its modelling of risk concepts, we decided against adopting
it in favour of ISO 31000 being standardised.</p>
<p>The two main standards we utilised for our risk ontology were ISO
31000:2018<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Risk Management Guidelines and
31073:2022<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Risk Management Vocabulary. From
these, we analysed risk-related concepts, definitions, intended uses in
these and other documents, and identified relations to create an
ontology. Here it is important to state that the resulting ontology is
our representation of how the ISO 31000 series can be used for
representing risk related information, and that these documents by
themselves do not prescribe any specific modelling of relations between
the concepts.</p>
<p>We first identified and represented all risk-related concepts from
ISO 31073:2022 as a SKOS vocabulary and identified taxonomic (i.e.
broader/narrower) relationships between them. This provided us with an
overview of what concepts are present in ISO’s risk standards and how
they relate to each other. We then identified additional relationships
between these concepts based on statements from ISO 31073:2022 and ISO
31000:2018 and expressed them as an <em>OWL</em> ontology. An overview
of the outcome is presented in <a href="#fig-riskonto">Figure. 2</a>, and the risk ontology is available
online<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>.</p>

    <figcaption>Overview of the Risk Ontology</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>By itself, this risk ontology is sufficient to represent risk-related
information required for DPIAs i.e. risk, risk sources, threat actors,
consequences and impacts of risks, and their attributes such as
likelihoods, severity, and levels. However, in practice, we found
variance in how these attributes are used by adopters, for example as
differences in risk scale where one set of levels goes from 1 to 5 and
another goes from 1 to 10, and yet another that uses only qualitative
labels (e.g. high/low). This represented a challenge in modelling
use-cases as it prevents a consistent representation of risk-related
information.</p>
<p>To address this, we created top-level concepts (e.g.
<code>RiskLevel</code>) with guidance that any attributes (e.g. risk
levels) must follow existing norms where statistical distributions are
used to harmonise differences in scales across use-cases. For example,
by representing 0 as the lowest possible scale and 1 as the highest,
qualitative terms like ’high risk’ or ’frequently occurring’ are forced
to be expressed as values or ranges between <code>0..1</code>. While the
exact values may differ between use-cases (for example, <code>0.5</code>
may be high-risk in one situation and <code>0.9</code> in another), they
are useful to compare the actual importance of concepts and harmonise
them when information is shared, reused, or imported. To aid with the
DPIA processes, we provide a list of commonly used scales regarding risk
levels and severity based on DPA guidance documents. The risk ontology
can thus be used alongside DPV to represent risk-related information
with more detail and granularity.</p>
<h3 id="sec:spec-rights">Thesauri of Fundamental Rights and
Freedoms</h3>
<p>The consideration of whether processing activities are likely to have
an impact on fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals is what
determines high-risk within DPIAs. While the actual assessment of
whether a use-case has impacts on fundamental rights requires expertise
and nuanced interpretations, we focused on the information required for
documenting these impacts. This required creating a vocabulary of
fundamental rights and freedoms, as defined within the EU Charter of
Fundamental Rights, and associating them with impacts of a risk as well
as the effect of those impacts.</p>
<p>We started by representing each Article in the document as a
<code>skos:Concept</code> (e.g. Article 7 as <em>RightToPrivacy</em>),
with the Title used to structure them (e.g. Title II as Freedoms).
Further distinction between these, in particular regarding what
constitutes a <em>right</em> and a <em>freedom</em> would require
philosophical interpretations and their application within the legal
domain of EU laws <span class="citation"
data-cites="vandijkRiskRightData2016"><a
href="#ref-vandijkRiskRightData2016"
role="doc-biblioref">[17]</a></span>. In future, we aim to expand this
vocabulary by modelling the concepts from specific clauses within each
article, and investigating whether they can be represented as an
ontology. The current iteration is available online<a href="#fn17"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>.</p>
<p>To indicate impacts affecting rights and freedoms, we created the
concept <code>ImpactOnRights</code> as a specialisation of
<code>dpv:Impact</code> within the DPIA specification, with further
specialisations for each identified rights (e.g.
<code>ImpactOnRightToPrivacy</code>). The decision on whether concepts
related to impact on rights should be part of the main DPV vocabulary
requires careful deliberation as the notion of <em>rights</em> is not
uniformly represented or interpreted in laws across the globe.</p>
<h3 id="sec:spec-concepts">Populating Risks and Mitigation Concepts</h3>
<p>Along with concepts related to DPIAs, providing commonly used terms
related to risks and mitigations would also benefit adopters in
representing their use-cases and documentations. As DPA guidance
documents provide a small but good number of examples, we looked for
additional concepts to better model industry challenges, and to
incorporate and represent as much of the commonly utilised terms and
‘good practices’.</p>
<p>We first referred to documents published by the European Union Agency
for Cybersecurity<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> (ENISA) which provide an expert
collection and overview of cybersecurity related incidents, issues, and
methods for addressing them. We identified four candidate documents: (i)
Risk Management Standards; (ii) Compendium of Risk Management Frameworks
with Potential Interoperability; (iii) Interoperable EU Risk Management
Framework; and (iv) Guidelines for SMEs on the security of personal data
processing.</p>
<p>We also identified three existing privacy risk methodologies and
taxonomies that we plan to integrate into our work: Jakobi et al’s list
of user-perceived privacy risks <span class="citation"
data-cites="jakobiTaxonomyUserperceivedPrivacy2022"><a
href="#ref-jakobiTaxonomyUserperceivedPrivacy2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[18]</a></span>, Solove’s Privacy Harms <span
class="citation" data-cites="citronPrivacyHarms2021a"><a
href="#ref-citronPrivacyHarms2021a"
role="doc-biblioref">[19]</a></span>, and LINDDUN <span class="citation"
data-cites="wuytsLINDDUNGOLightweight2020"><a
href="#ref-wuytsLINDDUNGOLightweight2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[20]</a></span>. Of these, LINDDUN is notable in
that it provides a privacy engineering framework that provides knowledge
bases and taxonomies for threats and mitigations associated with
software systems. It models 7 threat categories and their mitigations,
structured according to the LINDDUN acronym as: Linkability,
Identifiability, Non-repudiation, Detectability, Disclosure of
Information, Unawareness, and Non-compliance. These will be used to
categorise and structure risk concepts from other sources for DPIAs,
with the ‘threats’ in LINDDUN modelled as ‘risks’ in our work, and
‘mitigations’ modelled as technical and organisational measures in DPV
or risk mitigation measures in DPIA (as appropriate).</p>
<h2 id="sec:demo">Applying to Real-World Use-Cases and Tools</h2>
<h3 id="sec:demo-usecase">Documenting Real-world Use-cases</h3>
<p>To better understand how our specification fits its purpose, we
looked for publicly available documents and selected three prominent
ones based on quality of information, conclusion of investigation, and
their topicality. These relate to DPIAs carried out in Netherlands (and
involving government bodies and authorities) for use of Zoom <span
class="citation" data-cites="DPIASURFDutch2022"><a
href="#ref-DPIASURFDutch2022" role="doc-biblioref">[21]</a></span>,
Microsoft Office 365 <span class="citation"
data-cites="DPIAOffice3652020"><a href="#ref-DPIAOffice3652020"
role="doc-biblioref">[22]</a></span>, and Google Apps (GSuite) <span
class="citation" data-cites="DPIAGoogleSuite2021"><a
href="#ref-DPIAGoogleSuite2021" role="doc-biblioref">[23]</a></span>.
All three cases represent complex services and infrastructures, and the
large length of reports produced reflect the scope and breadth of
information that is considered relevant for their DPIAs.</p>
<p>As we stated in the motivation, these DPIAs are also produced as
human-readable documents with no ability to extract, query, or reuse
their information. First we analysed the kind of information represented
in these reports and whether our work (along with DPV) was sufficient in
expressing it. We found that we could represent most of the concepts
associated with how the processing takes place, e.g. personal data
involved or purposes or data transfers. What we could not represent
related to complexities of data collections and transfers, such as where
Microsoft and Google combine their data across different services and
transfer them outside EU/EEA. We also could not represent information
about <em>absence</em> - such as a specific measure not being present,
or <em>negation</em> - such as when a company asserted that they do not
perform some activity. This resulted in gaps associated with information
the DPIA was generated based upon.</p>
<p>The information regarding risks, mitigations, consequences, and
impacts in most cases was directly associated with specific
implementation details and technologies, and therefore could be
represented using DPV and our DPIA and risk ontologies. However some of
the consequences and impacts were difficult to quantify since they
related to specific behaviours of individuals or groups, and were
hypothetical scenarios that could not be specified with likelihood or
severity. We observed this pattern in all three documents. We perform a
self-reflection on this experience in <a href="#fig-pia">Figure. 3.</a></p>
<figure id="fig-pia">
    <img src="img/053-PIA.png">
    <figcaption>Example of CNIL's PIA tool modified for using DPV as: (1) a knowledge base; (2) providing concepts in relevant sections as controls and definitions; (3) selectively adding concepts to DPIA with description; (4) custom templates explaining how to use DPV concepts; (5) guided data entry for using DPV concepts.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="sec:demo-cnil">Use with CNIL’s PIA Tool</h3>
<p>CNIL, the French DPA, has developed the PIA (Privacy Impact
Assessment) tool that assists organisations in documenting, reviewing,
and sharing information regarding DPIAs. The tool is open source<a
href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>, free to use, and can be used as
standalone software or on a server (e.g. for sharing). A DPIA is
conducted by filling in free-form text or selecting one of specified
options within the different form-like sections that relate to
description of processing activities, and identifying risks and
mitigations. The user can create and select ’templates’ that contain
pre-populated questions and guidance, and ’knowledge bases’ that enable
creating concepts for definitions, principles, risks, and mitigations.
At the end of input, the tool provides an overview of risk scores based
on entered information, and provides the ability for reviewing and
approving (e.g. by a DPO).</p>
<p>The PIA tool provides import/export functionality using JSON for
DPIA, templates, and knowledge bases. However, it is not documented in
terms of structure and content, as well as how the tool interprets (or
<em>parses</em>) the content and uses it within the layout. We
investigated how our DPV-based DPIA information could be integrated or
reused within this tool. This required reverse-engineering the import
formats by experimenting with different data exports and analysing them.
See for work in progress.</p>
<p>We are investigating the full extent of PIA’s undocumented format and
attempting to liaise with the developers on how to integrate RDF-based
concepts within it. For this work, we used a script to convert and
import DPV’s concept using JSON. However, this removes the usefulness of
DPV’s semantics, e.g. identifying relevant risks associated with a
parent concept. We hope to utilise (and advance) our DPIA specification
so that it can be used within the PIA tool as a knowledge base, to
describe various DPIA templates, and to provide consistent and
interoperable access to exported information. From this, we also hope to
investigate the capability of assisting stakeholders with automated
forms of: risk discovery - in particular high-risk, suitable
mitigations, and expressing impacts.</p>
<h2 id="sec:eval">Discussion</h2>
<p><strong>Sufficiency of Concepts in DPV:</strong><span
id="sec:eval-sufficiency" label="sec:eval-sufficiency"></span>
Sufficiency as a criteria refers to the extent to which our concepts can
represent information. The DPIA specification (including DPV) is
sufficient to represent the information as specified in GDPR Art.35, but
lacks representing concepts associated with other parts of the GDPR - in
particular the principles in Art.5. This is because the focus of DPV has
been on providing only a <em>conceptual vocabulary</em>, whereas tasks
such as DPIAs require also <em>principles</em> and <em>controls</em> -
both of which have specific meaning within law and industry practices.
In addition, the DPA guidance clearly points to a need to represent
organisational processes regarding governance and risk management in the
same document as processing activities and GDPR compliance.</p>
<p>We therefore recommend undertaking an evaluation of what aspects of
GDPR are currently represented within the DPV, and to prioritise
inclusion of concepts such as principles which are important in legal
investigations - such as DPIAs. A relevant resource in this is the
Standard Data Protection Model (SDM) <span class="citation"
data-cites="StandardDataProtection2020"><a
href="#ref-StandardDataProtection2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[24]</a></span> produced by the German body of
DPAs, which provides interpretations of the GDPR in the form of
technical and organisational measures. That said, our approach as
compared to the SotA definitively is novel, and extends the available
methods for conducting and documenting DPIAs as machine-readable
information that can be shared and reused. It provides the advantage of
machine-readability for using the same information for multiple tasks
e.g. to carry out DPIAs (this work) and ROPA - another obligation under
GDPR Art.30 <span class="citation"
data-cites="ryanDPCatSpecificationInteroperable2022"><a
href="#ref-ryanDPCatSpecificationInteroperable2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[25]</a></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Representation vs Practical
Considerations:</strong><span id="sec:eval-knowledge"
label="sec:eval-knowledge"></span> GDPR and DPIAs are a relatively new
legal requirement. As a result, both DPAs and organisations are still
understanding the intricacies, complexities, and requirements associated
with it. We have only laid the groundwork for creating DPIA-related
knowledge bases and tools, and there is abundant scope for enriching
this work - such as adding more concepts from existing sources. At the
same time, the work needs grounding and analysis of specific DPIA
approaches to ensure that whatever knowledge is generated is of
practical use and beneficial to stakeholders. Our experience with the
three DPIAs and the use of the PIA tool shows that automation of
processes such as DPIAs have a long road ahead.</p>
<p>We believe impact assessments such as DPIAs are an important aspect
of accountability and responsibility, and that completely automating
them disregards the intended purpose, and creates false or incorrect
notions of safety. Instead, we advocate technology (and technologists)
should aim to assist rather than replace a human with related DPIA
tasks. Therefore, in addition to adding concepts or using rules or
similar mechanisms, DPIA-related approaches should also investigate
their role and usefulness in conducting <em>actual DPIAs</em> to better
understand the disparity between investigation and documentation, and to
provide better solutions for capturing the human-generated inputs that
can be used for enriching the underlying semantics in future updates.
This requires time, financing, and domain expertise - which are
difficult to obtain and efficiently utilise in smaller capacities. We
therefore recommend undertaking this at larger avenues, such as national
and EU frameworks and projects so that a culture of shared knowledge
(based on use of semantics) can be established and exploited by public
and private bodies alike.</p>
<p><strong>Shared Impact Assessments:</strong><span
id="sec:eval-sharing" label="sec:eval-sharing"></span> The lack of
domain-specific knowledge regarding what is being investigated, who it
affects, technologies involved, requirements of laws such as GDPR, and
governance processes associated with risk management is a challenge in
DPIAs. Our motivation was to address this through sharing and
interoperability of information by using semantic web technologies.
Through this, common shared resources for risks and impact management
can be developed and shared for reuse. However, a DPIA is not the only
impact assessment that concerns risks, mitigations, and fundamental
rights and freedoms. The GDPR itself specifies similar assessments
regarding data transfers and legitimate interests. In addition, future
regulation proposed by the EU, in particular the AI Act <span
class="citation" data-cites="EU_AI_Reg"><a href="#ref-EU_AI_Reg"
role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span> and Health Data Space<a href="#fn20"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>,
include impact assessment for high-risk as obligations. Such impact
assessments have a large degree of commonality and overlap.</p>
<p>While researchers have investigated the overlap between DPIAs and the
proposed AI impact assessment <span class="citation"
data-cites="selbstInstitutionalViewAlgorithmic2021"><a
href="#ref-selbstInstitutionalViewAlgorithmic2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[26]</a></span>, there is no work to date that
effectively shows how one can benefit from the other. Instead of
developing separate and fragmented approaches for how these risk and
impact assessments are carried out, documented, and investigated, a good
solution would be to ‘share’ them as much as possible to reduce the
burden on both organisations and auditors. In this, the shared
information could relate to risks, mitigations, or categories of
impacts, or even the structuring of information for reusing the same
tools. This requires undertaking exercises similar to this one for other
kinds of impact assessments, which has not been done within the state of
the art, and to then identify avenues for shared impact assessments. We
plan to undertake such an exercise for combining DPIAs with AI Act’s
impact assessments in the future.</p>
<h2 id="sec:conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), obligated by the EU
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), are an important part of
ensuring accountability and responsibility of personal data processing,
and to identify and minimise harmful impacts to individuals regarding
their fundamental rights. We presented the first step towards expressing
DPIA and its relevant information as a machine-readable specification
that can be used to document risks, mitigations, and their impacts in a
formal manner and reused in information systems based on semantic web
technologies. To better understand and explore how this work would be of
practical use, we utilised three real-world complex DPIAs and identified
limitations and important gaps within use of automation and
human-involvement in DPIA investigations. Based on this, we have
provided discussions on practicality and benefits of our approach in
sharing information regarding risks and mitigations, and that this needs
to incorporate human-generated information as an important aspect of
DPIA documentations. In terms of future work, we have clearly identified
concrete steps - such as enrichment of vocabularies based on available
sources, and several promising directions - such as the creation of
<em>shared impact assessments</em> based on commonalities between DPIA
and EU’s proposed AI Act.</p>
