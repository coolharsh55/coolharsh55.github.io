<p><strong>Abstract</strong> Protecting and preserving individuals' personal data is a legal obligation set out by the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). However, the process of implementing data governance to support that, in a decentralised ecosystem, is still vague. Motivated by the need for lawful decentralised data processing, this paper outlines several relevant questions from legal, privacy and technology standpoints that need to be considered.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The rapid growth of the data economy and the privacy implications
accompanying it have motivated a new paradigm shift towards
decentralisation of data on the Web. This digital transformation aims to
foster data sovereignty and interoperability and to empower individuals
by allowing them to take back control over their personal data.
Decentralised technology such as SOLID <span class="citation"
data-cites="sambra2016solid"><a href="#ref-sambra2016solid"
role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span> has shown promising results and has
slowly started to replace centralised digital infrastructures in several
organisations across the European Union (EU). Motivated by the need for
lawful decentralised data processing, this paper outlines several
relevant questions from legal, privacy and technology standpoints that
need to be considered.</p>
<h3
id="how-to-describe-and-catalogue-data-for-decentralised-interoperability">How
to describe and catalogue data for decentralised interoperability?</h3>
<p>In a decentralised ecosystem, resources (e.g. data) should be
described in a way that supports their interoperability by different
services and machines to facilitate their discoverability, reuse and
correct interpretation of their use policies. Utilising a consistent RDF
vocabulary such as the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>,
which is a W3C recommendation for describing datasets and online
services in a machine-readable format, can be a starting point. DCAT’s
support for semantically representing resources, their role within a
system, the associated agents and the ability to classify them in
catalogues based on themes can help structure decentralised data sharing
and direct a service to a specific available resource that can be used
for the specific purposes. To use any such vocabulary to describe a
decentralised resource it should be clear what data exists in the
resource and its availability in terms of what agent, when and for what
purpose can use it and it what way. Mechanisms that automatically ensure
resource’s quality and completeness (e.g. specification of its
availability) based on the set standard resource description format are
needed as well.</p>
<h3
id="how-to-establish-trust-and-verify-identities-in-a-decentralised-system">How
to establish, trust, and verify identities in a decentralised
system?</h3>
<p>Merely using the Web’s domain-based identity may not be sufficient or
even feasible in all cases. For example, cases where identities may
always need to be <em>known</em> - such as a company’s <em>legal
identity</em> for accountability purposes, while in other contexts the
identity may need to be <em>hidden</em> - such as to create a safe space
for marginalised communities that use pseudonyms or identifiers instead
of their real names. The issue of how to issue and manage identity
useful for ‘contextual identification’ therefore also becomes an issue
of trust to show or hide identities, to not misuse it, counter
malpractices such as fraud - without surveillance or exposing sensitive
information regarding private lives.</p>
<h3
id="how-to-identify-and-ensure-security-of-data-and-processing-in-decentralised-systems">How
to identify and ensure security of data and processing in decentralised
systems?</h3>
<p>Decentralised systems distribute the responsibilities for security
mechanisms to be ensured and enforced across three levels. First for
data - which could be encrypted, hidden from discovery, or be spread
across locations. Second for data storage and transfer infrastructure,
such as through encrypted communications or access control. Third in the
<em>secure processing</em> of data, where involvement of multiple
systems and actors establishes requirements for each actor to
<em>identify</em> and <em>ensure</em> security of data and processing
taking place <em>elsewhere</em> to avoid to detect lapses in security,
such as failure to validate correctness or data breaches. While
decentralisation reduces the scale for affected data, it increases the
severity as all sensitive data relating to a context or individuals
would be present within the single breached resource. Establishing
accountability is a challenge under the current cybersecurity and legal
frameworks due to lack of precedent and knowledge.</p>
<h3
id="how-to-support-individuals-in-making-sense-of-decentralised-data-sharing">How
to support individuals in making sense of decentralised data
sharing?</h3>
<p>It should be clear from the start if personal data (Art. 4(1)) and
what specific categories of it (Art. 9) will be processed. In such
cases, even in decentralised settings, at least one of GDPR’s legal
basis for data processing should be met to be legally compliant. For
consent to be a legal base, it should be freely given, informed and
unambiguous (Art. 7). Mediums for requesting consent online, such as web
cookies, often present ambiguous information regarding the data
processing, have deceptive design and dark patterns that are often
invisible to a non-experts eye. User agents that correctly interpret
GDPR’s legal basis and their specific requirements and that have
knowledge of common dark patterns can be used to filter out deceptive
cookie banners and consent requests. This will also minimise the
information overload and consent fatigue of individuals and can help
establish a level of trust in the agent and services that request access
to data. Consent requests via cookies are usually accompanied with
privacy policies that outline how data should be managed (i.e. gathered,
used, disclosed). However, due to defining these rules in legal language
and their length, they are often overlooked by data subjects. This is
the case especially with non-experts who do not have the legal knowledge
and patience to correctly interpret the privacy policy’s content. To
solve this, graph visualisations and UIs integrating them have emerged
as a possible solution to ease individuals’ comprehension <span
class="citation" data-cites="bless2021raising"><a
href="#ref-bless2021raising" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span>.</p>
<h3
id="how-to-establish-responsibility-and-foster-accountability-across-actors-in-decentralised-settings">How
to establish responsibility and foster accountability across actors in
decentralised settings?</h3>
<p>Currently in centralised systems service providers are responsible
for storing and processing individuals’ data in a legally compliant way.
In a decentralised system, data subjects are given control and ownership
of their data, which can be a burden <span class="citation"
data-cites="pandit2023making"><a href="#ref-pandit2023making"
role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span>. The responsibilities of agents
should be clearly defined, agreed upon and described within each
resources’ metadata to establish accountability and transparency. For
example, each resource can be catalogued and licensed (e.g. use of
technology such as Data Licenses Clearance Center (DALICC) <span
class="citation" data-cites="pellegrini2018automated"><a
href="#ref-pellegrini2018automated"
role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span>). Machine-readable contracts <span
class="citation" data-cites="tauqeer2022automated"><a
href="#ref-tauqeer2022automated" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></span>)
and consent <span class="citation" data-cites="kurteva2021consent"><a
href="#ref-kurteva2021consent" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span>,
outlining each actors’ duties and responsibilities, can also be defined
with specific service providers to minimise consent fatigue.</p>
<h3
id="how-to-balance-the-legal-obligations-and-responsibilities-for-decentralised-actors">How
to balance the legal obligations and responsibilities for decentralised
actors?</h3>
<p>Regulatory frameworks such as the GDPR are based on the conventional
notions of centralised organisations collecting and managing data (as
Controllers) that may utilise other actors to process it on their behalf
(as Processors). The interpretation of such regulations towards
decentralised solutions is unknown, which creates uncertainty, which
ultimately hinders progress. Blindly charging forth with innovation may
therefore end up not only harming the individuals involved, but also the
service providers who want to develop new markets. A pragmatic and
proactive solution therefore is to create solutions that function within
the existing established boundaries of law, while developing new
interpretations or legislations to facilitate further decentralisation.
For example, there are no circumstances where users shouldering all the
legal responsibilities of being a Controller have greater ‘freedom’, and
instead will only face ‘burdens’ and ‘exploitation’ from lack of
knowledge or willingness. Therefore a reasonable path forward is to
identify mechanisms that either establish responsibilities, such as
through model contracts for decentralised infrastructure and service
providers, or to share responsibilities, such as through community
bargaining and gatekeepers. While these happen, we should also engage
with lawmakers and authorities to provide formal guidelines for the same
and to develop future legislations. Of note, the European Union has
already passed the Data Governance Act and has proposed Data Spaces that
advance this conversation.</p>
<h3
id="how-to-develop-infrastructure-and-tools-for-decentralised-systems">How
to develop infrastructure and tools for decentralised systems?</h3>
<p>In order to set up decentralised systems and services, an essential
requirement is the availability of necessary infrastructure and tooling.
For example, identity providers, data and processing associated
resources - such as for storage, querying, computing, etc. - as well as
specific tools for developers to create and users to consume and manage
these resources. Before researching new methods to achieve the intended
functionality, it is also necessary to enquire whether any of the
existing tools and services can be reused or repurposed to provide all
or some of the requirements. Where the market ecosystem has well
established practices based on formal or de-factor standards, its reuse
would be beneficial to increase the penetration and adoption of
decentralised systems. For example, cloud technologies have reached the
stage where they are widespread, are the subject of extensive
standardisation, and have regulatory frameworks guiding responsible
usage. Can we identify the "innovation" such existing technologies
require to realise the decentralised vision and push market actors to
developed these based on new markets and values? In parallel, existing
infrastructure also has useful governance structures that can aid in
resolving some of the pending issues with decentralisation. For example,
rather than thinking of decentralisation as separation of independent
nodes, we can establish decentralisation as communities where trust of
services could be managed with gate-keeping or certification mechanisms
such as that used within the app stores. For all the above, the
existence of standards or common specifications is not a strict
<em>necessity</em>, but will certainly accelerate development and
adoption.</p>
<h3
id="what-is-required-to-develop-effective-tools-for-automation-in-decentralised-systems">What
is required to develop effective tools for automation in decentralised
systems?</h3>
<p>Automation requires machine-readable information, which also needs to
be interoperable if it is to be shared between systems. While we are a
community that propagates semantic interoperability to achieve
decentralisation, the key question to ask ourselves is this: <em>“Can we
ever reach an agreement to develop a standard?”</em> for any of the
described topics here. While we have a variety of W3C recommendations as
standards, and several tools and ontologies - often arising from large
projects, we have neither seen their wider adoption and thus
<em>effectiveness</em>, nor their acknowledgement as being
<em>superior</em>. So the first requirement for the community is
identifying what “standards” exist and what standards <em>should</em>
exist - and from this creating a roadmap for achieving those. The second
requirement is engaging with stakeholders to establish the minimum
requirements agreeable to all, and codifying those as a standard to
provide a guiding framework for interoperable solutions. The third
requirement is then extending this standard with opinionated tools and
methodologies to create operational services.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Decentralised systems are not identical replications spread over
multiple locations, but instead facilitate diversity and variance while
relying on commonality to communicate and inter-operate. Therefore, as
long as we have a common vocabulary (e.g. Data Privacy Vocabulary
(DPV)<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a><span class="citation"
data-cites="pandit2019creating"><a href="#ref-pandit2019creating"
role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span>) that can be semantically expressed
and whose interpretation is <em>well-defined</em>, we can have
decentralised solutions that act in a predictable manner while being
free to perform with any technology or tools that they prefer to use.
All of the above research questions that we have outlined should
therefore be reframed to ask how to reach an agreement on communication
of that topic between decentralised systems.</p>
