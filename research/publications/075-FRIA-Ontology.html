<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The recently published EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) is a landmark regulation that regulates the use of AI technologies. One of its novel requirements is the obligation to conduct a Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA), where organisations in the role of deployers must assess the risks of their AI system regarding health, safety, and fundamental rights. Another novelty in the AI Act is the requirement to create a questionnaire and an automated tool to support organisations in their FRIA obligations. Such automated tools will require a machine-readable form of information involved within the FRIA process, and additionally also require machine-readable  documentation to enable further compliance tools to be created. In this article, we present our novel representation of the FRIA as an ontology based on semantic web standards. Our work builds upon the existing state of the art, notably the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV), where similar works have been established to create tools for GDPR's Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) and other obligations. Through our ontology, we enable the creation and management of FRIA, and the use of automated tool in its various steps.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The European Union’s recently published Artificial Intelligence Act
(AI Act) <span class="citation" data-cites="EU_AIAct"><a
href="#ref-EU_AIAct" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span> is the first of
its kind regulation that governs AI systems with a particular focus on
harms to health, safety, and fundamental rights. A key and novel
requirement established in AI Act Article 27 is the Fundamental Rights
Impact Assessment (FRIA) which requires deployers of AI systems to
assess the risks and impacts of their AI systems on fundamental human
rights. The FRIA is a structured process following existing procedures
for impact assessments, and was developed based on the similar procedure
under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <span
class="citation" data-cites="EU_GDPR"><a href="#ref-EU_GDPR"
role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span> for Data Protection Impact
Assessments (DPIA). As development of AI technologies has progressed
rapidly within the last decade, and the AI Act itself is a new legal
framework, conducting and using a FRIA poses significant challenges not
only regarding legal compliance, but also from the perspectives of data
governance to identify and maintain relevant information and information
systems to develop tools that can support and enhance these
processes.</p>
<p>The current conventional method for implementing FRIA is to identify
obligations linked to specific clauses in the AI Act and find the steps
needed to complete them. For organisations, such tasks are primarily
human-oriented activities that utilise word processor software (e.g. MS
Word) and document formats (e.g. PDF) that contain unstructured
information and are not suitable for developing automated procedures and
tooling. Further, organisations commonly have several departments or
organisational units that can contain different technologies and
practices, making a combined legal assessment of the organisation as a
whole a challenging and complicated affair. The AI Act in Article 27-5
foresees such challenges and requires the AI Office, the EU body
responsible for the implementation of the AI Act, to create a
‘questionnaire’ to support organisations in meeting the obligations for
a FRIA. The AI Act, in the same article, also states that such a
questionnaire should be provided with an automated tool - though it does
not clarify what automation or support mean in this context.</p>
<p>Based on prior work regarding the use of knowledge engineering and
information systems to support and enhance the DPIA process and its use
for complying with the GDPR <span class="citation"
data-cites="panditSemanticSpecificationData2022"><a
href="#ref-panditSemanticSpecificationData2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span>, we identify the need for a formal
representation of the FRIA process that can aid the creation of
questionnaires and automated tools and support the documentation
involved by providing a consistent, structured, and interoperable
approach. By developing an ontology for FRIA, this paper thus aims to
bridge the gap between the high-level legal requirements of the AI Act
and the technical, procedural steps necessary for effective compliance,
risk management, and governance of AI systems.</p>
<p>We use the following research question to guide our work: “<em>How
can we represent the FRIA as an organisational process through a
standards-based, machine-readable, and interoperable ontology?</em>”.
Here, standards refers to the W3C semantic web standards of RDF for
representing information in a machine-readable format, and RDFS and OWL
to create an ontological representation. The contribution of this
article is thus an OWL ontology that enables the operational
implementation of a FRIA within an organisation to meet the AI Act’s
obligations.</p>
<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>To develop the ontology, we follow the Linked Open Terms (LOT)
ontology engineering methodology <span class="citation"
data-cites="poveda2022lot"><a href="#ref-poveda2022lot"
role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span> which has been used successfully in
several projects, and is based on the NeOn ontology engineering
methodology which has been used in the creation of similar legally
relevant ontologies including for GDPR’s DPIA <span class="citation"
data-cites="panditSemanticSpecificationData2022"><a
href="#ref-panditSemanticSpecificationData2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span>. The first step in LOT is the
development of an ontology requirements specification that outlines “why
the ontology is being built and to identify and define the requirements
the ontology should fulfil”. For this, LOT recommends the use of
competency questions which are a well established practice in the
ontology engineering community. We reused the template provided by LOT
to generate the ontology requirements specification, which is presented
in Table 1.</p>

<h2 id="state-of-the-art">State of the Art</h2>
<p>Within ontology engineering methodologies based on semantic web,
including LOT, the reuse of existing ontologies is heavily recommended.
Therefore, following the requirements specification, we explore the
state of the art to identify relevant resources and assess the extent to
which they can be reused to implement our FRIA ontology. In this, we
divide the existing literature in two categories: first, existing
ontologies that directly and explicitly address FRIA, or if not, then
the AI Act; and second, ontologies that address similar mechanisms such
as DPIA under GDPR, or impact assessments based on established
procedures such as ISO standards.</p>
<h3 id="existing-ontologies-for-fria-and-ai-act">Existing Ontologies for
FRIA and AI Act</h3>
<p>Given the recency of the AI Act in terms of development and
finalisation, few approaches have emerged that provide ontologies
modelling it. Golpayegani et al. were one of the first approaches to
model the requirements of the AI Act as an ontology through the AI Risk
Ontology (AIRO) <span class="citation"
data-cites="golpayegani2022airo"><a href="#ref-golpayegani2022airo"
role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></span> - an OWL2 ontology based on an early
draft version of the AI Act. AIRO provides a risk management ontology
based on the requirements of the AI Act and ISO standards, and acts as
the upper ontology for Vocabulary of AI Risks (VAIR) <span
class="citation" data-cites="golpayegani2023high"><a
href="#ref-golpayegani2023high" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span>.
Golpayegani et al. have demonstrated the use of AIRO and VAIR to model
the high-risk use-cases defined in AI Act Annex III as a logical group
of semantic concepts and showed that logical reasoning or validation
approaches such as SHACL can be used to determine whether the use-case
is high-risk under the AI Act <span class="citation"
data-cites="golpayegani2023high"><a href="#ref-golpayegani2023high"
role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span>. Golpayegani et al. have also
developed the AI Card <span class="citation"
data-cites="golpayeganiAICardsApplied2024"><a
href="#ref-golpayeganiAICardsApplied2024"
role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span> as a visual approach for documenting
the AI system through the use of AIRO and VAIR as its machine-readable
representation. AIRO and VAIR provide concepts required in the AI Act
such as stakeholders, AI processes, and risk management, but do not
contain a modelling of the FRIA.</p>
<p>Hernandez et al. developed the Trustworthy AI Requirements Ontology
(TAIR) <span class="citation" data-cites="hernandez2024open"><a
href="#ref-hernandez2024open" role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></span> which
models the clauses of the AI Act and of relevant ISO standards as a
series of requirements and compares them to identify where such
standards would be useful for compliance with the AI Act. This work
addresses the requirement for using ‘Harmonised Standards’ in the AI
Act, and includes concepts regarding impact assessments and risk
management, albeit these are based on a draft version of the AI Act.</p>
<p>Though not providing an ontology or directly addressing the final AI
Act requirements, these works provide an exploration of the FRIA
requirements by identifying information involved in conducting a FRIA:

role="doc-biblioref">[22]</a></span> which is an output of the W3C Data
Privacy Vocabularies and Controls Community Group (DPVCG), and provides
an extensible collection of vocabularies for modelling legal concepts
associated with data and technologies.</p>
<p>Of these, only the DPV has the community and infrastructure
supporting the continuos development and refinement of the resource, and
is also the only resource that had modelled GDPR which has been expanded
to also model the AI Act using the same core concepts <span
class="citation" data-cites="panditDataPrivacyVocabulary2024"><a
href="#ref-panditDataPrivacyVocabulary2024"
role="doc-biblioref">[22]</a></span>. The DPV is also the only resource
we know of that provides rich taxonomies to represent real-world
concepts associated with the ontological concepts e.g. for purposes and
data categories. The DPV features a TECH extension which provides
concepts for modelling the technology lifecycle, stakeholders, and
documentation, the RISK extension for modelling risk assessments, and
the AI extension which extends these to provide AI-specific concepts. In
DPV, the legal concepts derived from specific regulations are provided
in a separate namespace from these other ‘core’ vocabularies, and DPV
provides such legal extensions for EU GDPR and the EU AI Act. The DPV’s
GDPR extension provides concepts modelling the DPIA process based on

role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span> in to the AI and AI Act
extensions.</p>
<h2 id="fria-ontology">FRIA Ontology</h2>
<p>Our objective is to develop an ontology to model the FRIA as defined
in the AI Act Article 27 as an information process through which
stakeholders such as deployers and authorities can create automated
technological tools to support the compliance activities. For ensuring
our ontology is interoperable and extensible, we utilise semantic web
standards such as RDF to represent it, SKOS to create a vocabulary or
thesauri, and RDFS and OWL2 for knowledge representation. We follow the
Linked Open Terms (LOT) <span class="citation"
data-cites="poveda2022lot"><a href="#ref-poveda2022lot"
role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span> as the methodology for ontology
engineering, which strongly recommends reusing existing ontologies where
relevant. For this, from Section 3, we identified AIRO <span
class="citation" data-cites="golpayegani2022airo"><a
href="#ref-golpayegani2022airo" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></span> and
VAIR <span class="citation" data-cites="golpayegani2023high"><a
href="#ref-golpayegani2023high" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span> as
the most relevant ontologies for the AI Act, and the DPV <span
class="citation" data-cites="panditDataPrivacyVocabulary2024"><a
href="#ref-panditDataPrivacyVocabulary2024"
role="doc-biblioref">[22]</a></span> as a useful resource for practical
use of legal concepts. Since AIRO and VAIR are being integrated for the
upcoming DPV version 2.1, we aim to support this integration by
identifying the concepts not present in these existing ontologies.</p>
<p>DPV is provided with RDFS+SKOS semantics as the ‘default
serialisation’, with a separate namespace used for OWL2 semantics to
support the use of concepts beyond the strict requirements of logical
constraints when using OWL2. Following this, we provide the concepts
necessary to model the FRIA in this article which can then be expanded
as more information is available to represent real-world constraints and
logical assertions using OWL2 or another method.</p>
<p>The concept for Fundamental Rights Impact Assessments (FRIA) already
exists within the main DPV as <code>dpv:FRIA</code>, and is extended as
<code>eu-aiact:FRIA</code> in AI Act extension to represent the FRIA as
defined within the AI Act. This concept represents the FRIA as both an
activity and as an artefact (e.g. a document). Therefore, in our FRIA
ontology, we create separate explicit concepts for modelling the
information and steps involved in the DPIA process by expanding this
central concept.</p>
<p>Based on the interpretation of the FRIA in AI Act Article 27, and by
using existing work interpreting the DPIA in GDPR as a series of steps
that are represented through an ontology <span class="citation"
data-cites="panditSemanticSpecificationData2022"><a
href="#ref-panditSemanticSpecificationData2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span>, we identified the following groups
of concepts for our ontology:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>FRIA Metadata:</strong> concepts representing relevant
metadata regarding the FRIA such as when it was conducted, by whom, for
which AI systems, etc.;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FRIA Necessity:</strong> concepts representing the step
where a necessity for conducting a FRIA is identified as per AI Act
Article 27-1;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FRIA Inputs:</strong> concepts representing the inputs
required in a FRIA as per AI Act Article 27-1, and the reuse of a DPIA
as per AI Act Article 27-4;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FRIA Outcomes:</strong> concepts representing the
outcomes identified from conducting a FRIA as per AI Act Article
27-1;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FRIA Notifications:</strong> concepts representing the
step where a FRIA to be communicated to an authority as per AI Act
Article 27-3;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FRIA Automated Tools:</strong> the use of questionnaire
and/or automated tools as per AI Act Article 27-5.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We use the following namespaces and prefixes in describing our
proposed ontology:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Our proposed ontology: <em>https://example.com/FRIA#</em> with
prefix <code>fria:</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>DCMI Metadata Terms: <code>http://purl.org/dc/terms/</code> with
prefix <code>dct</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>DPV: <em>https://w3id.org/dpv#</em> with prefix
<code>dpv:</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>DPV TECH extension: <em>https://w3id.org/dpv/tech#</em> with
prefix <code>tech:</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>DPV RISK extension: <em>https://w3id.org/dpv/risk#</em> with
prefix <code>risk:</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>DPV AI extension: <em>https://w3id.org/dpv/ai#</em> with prefix
<code>ai:</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>DPV EU AI Act extension:
<em>https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/aiact#</em> with prefix
<code>eu-aiact:</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="metadata-for-fria">Metadata for FRIA</h3>
<p>A FRIA, as a documentation requirement under the AI Act, is expected
to be regularly updated as per Article 27-2 “the deployer shall take the
necessary steps to update the information”. Therefore it is necessary to
indicate temporal information and provenance associated with the FRIA.
For these, we reuse prior work establishing the reuse of DCMI terms for
GDPR’s DPIA <span class="citation"
data-cites="panditSemanticSpecificationData2022"><a
href="#ref-panditSemanticSpecificationData2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span> regarding temporal information
(<code>dct:created</code>, <code>dct:modified</code>,
<code>dct:dateSubmitted</code>, <code>dct:dateAccepted</code>,
<code>dct:temporal</code>, <code>dct:valid</code>), conformance e.g.
codes of conduct (<code>dct:conformsTo</code>), descriptions
(<code>dct:title</code>, <code>dct:description</code>), identifier or
version (<code>dct:identifier</code>, <code>dct:isVersionOf</code>), and
subject or scope (<code>dct:subject</code>, and
<code>dct:coverage</code>).</p>
<p>To record provenance, we suggest reusing <code>dct:publisher</code>
to record the organisation responsible for conducting the FRIA,
<code>dct:contributor</code> to denote the personnel and entities
involved, and <code>dct:provenance</code> to refere to a log of changes.
Additionally, <code>dct:creator</code> can record the specific entity or
tool used to ‘create’ the resource - which is relevant as the AI Act
Article 27-5 explicitly provides for the use of automated tools in the
FRIA process.</p>
<h3 id="concepts-to-represent-necessity-of-fria">Concepts to represent
necessity of FRIA</h3>
<p>AI Act Article 27-1 describes the conditions under which a FRIA is
necessary. An organisation therefore has the obligation to first assess
whether it must conduct a FRIA. We represent this process through the
concept <code>fria:FRIANecessityAssessment</code> which extends the
existing <code>eu-aiact:FRIA</code> concept and can be associated with a
FRIA using the relation <code>dpv:hasAssessment</code>. To represent the
specific outputs of this process, we create the concepts
<code>fria:FRIANecessityStatus</code> which is associated with the
assessment using the relation <code>dpv:hasStatus</code>. To represent
specific outcomes, we create the instances
<code>fria:FRIARequired</code> and
<code>fria:FRIANotRequired</code>.</p>
<h3 id="concepts-to-represent-inputs-of-fria">Concepts to represent
inputs of FRIA</h3>
<p>We represent the process of carrying out the FRIA as the concept
<code>fria:FRIAProcedure</code> which extends the existing
<code>eu-aiact:FRIA</code> concept and can be associated with a FRIA
using the relation <code>dpv:hasAssessment</code>. AI Act Article 27-1
describes the information which must be included when conducting a FRIA,
which we interpret as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Article 27-1a description of the deployer’s processes:
represented by extending <code>dpv:Process</code> as the concept
<code>fria:AIProcess</code>, and associated using the relation
<code>dpv:hasProcess</code>. This follows the DPV’s modelling of similar
processes for GDPR where a <code>dpv:Process</code> provides a way to
combine other concepts such as purposes, data, technologies, and
entities in specific roles.</p></li>
<li><p>Article 27-1a intended purpose: represented by the existing
<em>eu-aiact:IntendedPurpose</em> whose parent is <em>dpv:Purpose</em>,
and is assocaited using the relation <code>dpv:hasPurpose</code>. Note
that the AI Act’s intended purpose is a broad concept that goes beyond
DPV’s modelling of purpose as referring to the objective or goal,
whereas intended purpose includes details such as the AI technique and
data involved. Therefore, we suggest also modelling
<code>eu-aiact:IntendedPurpose</code> as the subclass of
<code>dpv:Process</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Article 27-1b period of time: represented using
<em>dpv:Duration</em> and associated using the relation
<code>dpv:hasDuration</code>. DPV provides enumerated concepts for
different durations such as endless, fixed, temporal, until event, and
until time.</p></li>
<li><p>Article 27-1b frequency: represented using <em>dpv:Frequency</em>
and associated using the relation <code>dpv:hasFrequency</code>. DPV
provides enumerated concepts for different frequencies such as
continous, often, singular, and sporadic.</p></li>
<li><p>Article 27-1b intended to be used: represented as
<em>fria:IntendedUse</em>, where we interpret this concept to be
different from <em>aiact:IntendedPurpose</em> as the ‘purpose’ is a
declaration of why the AI system is needed or to be used, and ‘use’ is
the contextual application of that purpose in specific scenarios or
‘deployments’. The same AI system with one intended purpose can thus
have different intended uses in separate scenarios e.g. through variance
in input and output data (including decisions produced), human subjects
involved, hardware and software being used. DPV already contains the
concept <code>tech:IntendedUse</code>, which should be the parent of
this concept.</p></li>
<li><p>Article 27-1c categories of natural persons and groups: which can
be represented using the existing concept <code>dpv:DataSubject</code>
provided in DPV with a taxonomy of categories such as tourists, adults,
minors. Though, data subject in DPV is currently defined as per the GDPR
in terms of natural persons whose data is being processed, which is not
compatible with our intended concept here. AIRO has
<code>AISubject</code> which is defined as natural persons subjected to
the use of AI which is more in line with what we want to model.
Therefore, to avoid duplication of these categories under AISubject, and
to avoid backwards incompatible changes to DPV as it is being actively
used, we propose either changing the definition of data subject to
include ‘data and AI subjects’ - following a similar change made in DPV
2.0 where the term remains the same <code>dpv:DataSubject</code> but its
use now encompasses any data or technology including AI. Or, to create a
new concept called <code>dpv:HumanSubject</code> as the parent of
<code>dpv:DataSubject</code> and <code>airo:AISubject</code>, and move
the taxonomy of data and AI subjects under it.</p></li>
<li><p>Article 27-1c likely to be affected by its use in the specific
context: where likely is represented by <code>dpv:Likelihood</code> and
associated using <code>dpv:hasLikelihood</code>. Affected is interpreted
as referring to a <code>dpv:Consequence</code> taking place with its
subcategory <code>dpv:Impact</code> - which are associated using
<code>dpv:hasConsequence</code> and <code>dpv:hasImpact</code>
respectively. The entity or thing being affected is associated using
<code>dpv:hasConsequenceOn</code> and <code>dpv:hasImpactOn</code>
respectively. In DPV, consequence is the general term for referring to
events such as failure of equipment, and impact is the preferred term
for referring to entities being (significantly) affected such as through
physical harm or loss of resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Article 27-1d risks of harm: are represented by using
<code>dpv:Risk</code> for the risk, with the concept
<code>risk:Harm</code> to refer to harm. The RISK extension provides
further concepts for modelling different categories of harms e.g.
<code>risk:PhysicalHarm</code>. It also models these concepts as
<code>dpv:</code> to enable their use in different roles across
use-cases e.g. <code>risk:Harm</code> as a risk source, risk,
consequence, or impact through the use of relevant relations.</p></li>
<li><p>Article 27-1e human oversight measures: represented using
<code>dpv:HumanInvolvementForOversight</code> along with other
<code>dpv:HumanInvolvementConcepts</code>. DPV also provides additional
taxonomies to represent whether the entity can perform some activity
(<code>dpv:EntityPermissiveInvolvement</code>) such as correcting
outputs or cannot perform an activity
(<code>dpv:EntityNonPermissiveInvolvement</code>) such as not being able
to opt out.</p></li>
<li><p>Article 27-1e instructions for use: this is represented using
<code>eu-aiact:InstructionsForUse</code> which extends from
<code>tech:Documentation</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Article 27-1f measures to be taken in the case of the
materialisation of those risks: this is represented using
<code>dpv:RiskMitigationMeasure</code>, where the specific measures
mentioned in this clause include - arrangements for internal governance
and complaint mechanism, represented by
<code>dpv:GovernanceProcedures</code> and its more specific form
<code>dpv:IncidentManagementProcedures</code> and
<code>dpv:IncidentReportingCommunication</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to these, Article 27-2 mentions the FRIA can “rely on
previously conducted fundamental rights impact assessments or existing
impact assessments carried out by provider”, which we interpret as the
case where previous FRIA are used as inputs. Therefore, we suggest
reusing <code>dpv:hasData</code> to indicate when existing FRIA act as
inputs to the current FRIA process.</p>
<p>Similarly, Article 27-4 refers to the FRIA ‘complementing a DPIA’
where the DPIA covers some obligations related to the FRIA. As before,
we also interpret this case as providing for a DPIA to be reused within
the FRIA process, which can be expressed by using the relevant DPV
concepts to represent DPIA and associating it with a FRIA through the
relation <code>dpv:hasData</code>.</p>
<p>In the above, we have modelled our concepts based on the necessity to
document the information as required within the AI Act. An alternative
method to document these obligations is through the use of the PROV-O
ontology <span class="citation" data-cites="lebo2013prov"><a
href="#ref-lebo2013prov" role="doc-biblioref">[23]</a></span> where each
step is an activity with specific inputs and outputs, and where the
provenance of activities and input/output artefacts is to be maintained
as logs.</p>
<h3 id="concepts-to-represent-outcomes-of-fria">Concepts to represent
outcomes of FRIA</h3>
<p>AI Act’s Article 27-1 states the FRIA’s objective is to produce an
“assessment of the impact on fundamental rights that the use of (AI)
system may produce”, which in the simplest interpretation implies a
boolean categorisation as to whether there is or isn’t an impact on
fundamental rights. We therefore represent the process of determining
the outcome of a FRIA process as the concept
<code>fria:FRIAOutcome</code>, which extends the existing
<code>eu-aiact:FRIA</code> concept and can be associated with a FRIA
using the relation <code>dpv:hasAssessment</code>. And to represent the
outcomes, we model these as statuses through the concept
<code>fria:FRIAOutcomeStatus</code> which can be associated by using the
relation <code>dpv:hasStatus</code>.</p>
<p>We also create instances to represent the specific outcomes possible
as per Article 27:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>fria:FRIAOutcomeUnacceptableRisk</code>: FRIA outcome
status indicating that there is an unacceptable risk to fundamental
rights, implying the AI system should not be used.</p></li>
<li><p><code>fria:FRIAOutcomeHighResidualRisk</code>: FRIA outcome
status indicating high residual risk to fundamental rights which are not
acceptable for continuation.</p></li>
<li><p><code>fria:FRIAOutcomeRisksAcceptable</code>: FRIA outcome status
indicating residual risks to fundamental rights remain and are
acceptable for continuation.</p></li>
<li><p><code>fria:FRIAOutcomeRisksMitigated</code>: FRIA outcome status
indicating (all) risks to fundamental rights have been mitigated and it
is safe for continuation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As part of the FRIA procedure and the outcome process, it is
essential to identify the relevant fundamental rights which might be
impacted. Therefore, we reuse the DPV’s extension modelling the EU
Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms where each article within the
charter is represented as an instance of <code>dpv:Right</code>. To
represent which right is impacted, we reuse the concept
<code>risk:ImpactToRights</code> along with the relevant instance of
fundamental right, and associate it by using the relation
<code>dpv:hasImpact</code>.</p>
<p>To enable the granular investigation of impact on rights as required
in the FRIA process, we identify the need to to create impact concepts
for each right in a manner that allows directly stating that right has
been impacted e.g. <em>Impact on Right of Non-Discrimination</em>. We
also argue that it would be useful to further represent such impacts at
an even more granular level by creating concepts representing impacts on
specific <em>requirements</em> within the right e.g. to state there has
been an impact on this right due to discrimination based on a specific
category such as sex, race, gender, etc. as mentioned in Article 21 of
the Charter. We propose such concepts be added to the DPV’s extension
modelling fundamental rights so that they can be readily used with the
rest of DPV’s risk and impact assessment concepts.</p>
<h3 id="concepts-to-represent-notification-of-fria">Concepts to
represent notification of FRIA</h3>
<p>AI Act Article 27-3 states that upon completion of a FRIA, a deployer
“shall notify the market surveillance authority of its results”. We
represent this step as the concept
<code>fria:FRIANotificationAssessment</code>, which extends the existing
<code>eu-aiact:FRIA</code> concept and can be associated with a FRIA
using the relation <code>dpv:hasAssessment</code>. This steps requires
an assessment of whether the notification is required to be sent, or if
there is an exception as Article 27-3 also states “In the case referred
to in Article 46(1), deployers may be exempt from that obligation to
notify”.</p>
<p>To represent whether a notification is needed and has been
communicated, or is exempt, we create the concept
<code>fria:FRIANotificationStatus</code> which extends
<code>dpv:Status</code> and its instances:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>fria:FRIANotificationNeeded</code> for when a notification
has been identified as being needed, and requires further assessment for
whether it is required to be sent or is exempt;</p></li>
<li><p><code>fria:FRIANotificationNotSent</code> for when a FRIA
notification is identified as being required but it not sent
yet;</p></li>
<li><p><code>fria:FRIANotificationSent</code> for when the notification
is sent; and</p></li>
<li><p><code>fria:FRIANotificationExempt</code> for which the obligation
to notify is exempt as per Article 46-1. As each market surveillance
authority will have the ability to create exemptions, we also note the
possibility to expand this concept for different jurisdictions based on
the DPV’s modular legal framework.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>DPV contains several notices for obligations under GDPR such as for
privacy notice, data breach reporting, rights exercise notices - and
also provide guidance on modelling the information and metadata
involved. We therefore reuse this method of using ‘notices’ to indicate
communication of information between entities, and represent information
in a FRIA notification the concept <code>fria:FRIANotice</code> by
extending <code>dpv:Notice</code>, which can be associated using
<code>dpv:hasNotice</code>.</p>
<h3 id="fria-questionnaire-and-automated-tool">FRIA Questionnaire and
Automated Tool</h3>
<p>AI Act Article 27-5 states the existence of a questionnaire based on
a template that the deployers can use to complete the FRIA obligations,
such as in Article 27-3 for communicating the FRIA to market
surveillance authorities by submitting the filled out questionnaire
template. The AI Act Article 27-5 further states that the questionnaire,
“including through an automated tool”, is intended “to facilitate
deployers in complying with their obligations under this Article” -
which means that the FRIA questionnaire and documentation in some part
can be based on automated tools.</p>
<p>To represent these processes, we find two interpretations based on
the word ‘template’ having two meanings. First interpretation consists
of three artefacts - a template questionnaire used to create a
questionnaire, which is then used by deployers to create a filled out
questionnaire. The second interpretation consists of two artefacts - a
questionnaire is used by the deployer to create a filled out
questionnaire. We follow it is the second interpretation, and represent
it through the concepts <em>fria:FRIAQuestionnaire</em> to represent the
template questionnaire that is given to be filled out by the deployer,
and extend it as <em>aiact:FRIACompletedQuestionnaire</em> to represent
the filled out questionnaire which the deployer can send in their notice
to the market surveillance authority.</p>
<p>To represent the involvement of tools as per Article 27-5, we create
the conecpt <em>aiact:FRIATool</em> which extends
<code>dpv:Technology</code>. This enables the reuse of DPV TECH
extension concepts regarding the modality (e.g. service, product),
stakeholders (e.g. developer, user), and other relevant data to be
modelled using existing concepts. The tool can be represented as being
used in relevant steps of the FRIA by associating it with the
<code>dpv:isImplementedUsingTechnology</code> relation.</p>
<p>We do not think it is necessary to explicitly define the tool as
being automated given the purpose of the ontology is to create
information systems which by definition use automation in some form.
That being said, automated here can be interpreted to have different
meanings within the context of “to facilitate deployers in complying
with their obligations under this Article in a simplified manner”. The
tool can be used to determine necessity, to assist in collecting and
organising input information, to determine - manually or through
reasoning - whether there is an impact on rights, and to support
notification to authority <em>aiact:FRIANotificationProcedure</em>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-future-work">Conclusion &amp; Future Work</h2>
<p>Our work represents the first ontology for modelling the Fundamental
Rights Impact Assessments (FRIA) under the AI Act in terms of the
information involved as well as the procedure for conducting FRIA
itself. As we utilised well-established standards in the legal domain -
namely the semantic web standards - our ontology enables the use of
machine-readable information that is interoperable, extensible, and
well-structured by default. Through this, we enable the creation of
automated tools to assist with the FRIA processes that can use our
ontology to structure and use information in a consistent manner across
use-cases. By being a semantic web ontology, our approach permits using
existing standards for information retrieval such as SPARQL, and for
SHACL for validation. It also facilitates use of logical semantic
reasoning to infer additional information - such as specific risks and
impacts, and to ensure completeness and correctness of information.</p>
<p>We developed our ontology by utilising and extending the Data Privacy
Vocabulary (DPV), which is a state of the art resource that is
continuously developed, and provides a modular approach to representing
legal concepts across jurisdictions. This enables the development of
practical tools that not only address the FRIA, but are also compatible
with the existing and potential uses of DPV in legal processes
associated with compliance, documentation, and communication. Our future
work therefore consists of integrating our proposed concepts in DPV by
participating within the W3C Data Privacy Vocabularies and Controls
Community Group (DPVCG), developing a prototype FRIA questionnaire and
automated tool that uses and maintains information based on our ontology
and DPV, and performing experiments to understand its utility for
different stakeholders such as organisations, auditors, market
surveillance authorities, and the AI Office.</p>
