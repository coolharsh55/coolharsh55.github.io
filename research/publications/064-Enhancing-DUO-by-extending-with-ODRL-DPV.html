<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health is an international consortium that is developing the Data Use Ontology (DUO) as a standard providing machine-readable codes for automation in data discovery and responsible sharing of genomics data. DUO concepts, which are encoded using OWL, only contain the textual descriptions of the conditions for data use they represent, and do not specify the intended permissions, prohibitions, and obligations explicitly - -which limits their usefulness.
We present an exploration of how the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) can be used to explicitly represent the information inherent in DUO concepts to create policies that are then used to represent conditions under which datasets are available for use, conditions in requests to use them, and to generate agreements based on a compatibility matching between the two.
We also address a current limitation of DUO regarding specifying information relevant to privacy and data protection law by using the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) which supports expressing legal concepts in a jurisdiction-agnostic manner as well as for specific laws like the GDPR.
Our work supports the existing socio-technical governance processes involving use of DUO by providing a complementary rather than replacement approach.
To support this and improve DUO, we provide a description of how our system can be deployed with a proof of concept demonstration that uses ODRL rules for all DUO concepts, and uses them to generate agreements through matching of requests to data offers.

<h2 id="sec:intro">Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="sec:intro-background">Background &amp; Motivation</h3>
<p>The sharing of health-related data holds great promise for enhancing
research and applying advanced computational and statistical techniques
for progress in medicine. At the same time, such sharing and use of
health-related data is required to be regulated at legal and
institutional levels given its sensitive nature and the ability to have
significant impacts. The current landscape consists of institutions such
as hospitals assessing each data use request through a dedicated
committee that is responsible for the evaluation and decision-making
regarding the release of data under their custody. To assist in this
process, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
(GA4GH) was formed as an international consortium for developing
standards and responsibly sharing genomics data. Of its various
initiatives addressing different components and processes involved in
data sharing, it has developed a machine-readable ontology called Data
Use Ontology<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> (DUO) <span class="citation"
data-cites="lawsonDataUseOntology2021 rehmGA4GHInternationalPolicies2021"><a
href="#ref-lawsonDataUseOntology2021" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a>, <a
href="#ref-rehmGA4GHInternationalPolicies2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span> for expressing “Data Use
Limitations” (DUL) – conditions and constraints expressed by data
providers and adhered by requestors.</p>
<p>DUO is an OWL ontology based on (and part of) Open Biological and
Biomedical Ontology<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> (OBO). Through the use of OBO upper
ontologies and guidelines, DUO offers (semantic) interoperability with a
variety of biomedical ontologies part of the OBO family. The intended
use of DUO is to annotate datasets with DUL codes to indicate usage
conditions, express data use requests, and identify or discover
compatible datasets automatically by comparing the request with
dataset-specific DULs. More information about DUO is provided in
Section.<a href="#sec:sota-duo" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:sota-duo">2.1</a>.</p>
<p>DUO concepts specify the DULs as human-readable text within their
description (using the <code>obo:IAO_0000115</code> relation), which
restricts their usefulness to humans or explicitly encoded systems that
can only function on known concepts. In addition, DUO concepts are not
linked to relevant legal concepts, which creates confusion and ambiguity
as to the implications of using these in a system or jurisdiction such
as the EU where the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <span
class="citation" data-cites="Regulation_GDPR"><a
href="#ref-Regulation_GDPR" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span>
introduces additional accountability and compliance requirements which
must be identified and applied. The existing documentation notes that
the applicability of laws is the responsibility of the adopter, and that
DUO terms have not been considered for implications under the GDPR.
However, compatibility with existing regulations is an important and
mandatory requirement that each adopter and data user must fulfil, and
where the lack of support from the specification risks harming the
interoperability through fragmentation in approaches. Additionally, the
EU envisions a ‘Health Data Space’<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> where
machine-readability and automation will play an important role in
facilitating the exchange of data without prejudice to existing
regulations such as the GDPR.</p>
<h3 id="sec:intro-research-question">Research Objectives and
Contributions</h3>
<p>Our argument is that <em>true machine-readability</em> requires the
information intended to be conveyed through DUO concepts about the
specific permissions, prohibitions, constraints, requirements, and so on
to be (also) represented as machine-readable <em>rules</em> that utilise
semantic concepts. With this, the DULs inherent in the descriptions of
each DUO concept are made explicit through formal representation as a
set of <em>rules</em> that can be attached and used alongside the data
as a <em>sticky policy</em>.</p>
<p>For assessing whether a data use request is compatible with the
dataset DULs, both data provider’s and requestor’s conditions for data
use are expressed as policies, and are compared to evaluate whether the
intended use is permissible. While DUO is already being used in this
manner, such as within the Data Use Oversight System<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>
(DUOS), this is done by checking hierarchical compatibility between
request concepts and data use conditions through subclass relations
between concepts. This approach is limited in ability and expressiveness
for specifying rules and their use in automated systems as not all
relevant information can be explicitly represented.</p>
<p>More importantly, to automate this process, a set of requirements
should be taken into consideration when choosing a vocabulary to express
dataset usage conditions, such as: (i) the expressiveness for defining
specifics of rules and policies, i.e., the specification of actions,
purposes, or other constraints as concepts that can be independently
expressed and assessed, and their combinations to represent different
categories of policies; (ii) the ability to associate and check their
conformance and compliance with legal requirements; and (iii) the
ability to specify requirements in machine-readable form and use them to
assess correctness and completeness of information. Such solutions have
existed for a while now – for example, Answer Set Programming (ASP) and
logic-based semantic reasoners have been utilised in a variety of
domains – including for representing information and using it for
checking legal compliance for GDPR (see Section.<a
href="#sec:sota-legal" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:sota-legal">2.2</a>).</p>
<p>With the above motivation, we present an approach for representing
the inherent information and rules in DUO concepts explicitly in RDF
through use of the Open Digital Rights Language<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>
(ODRL) <span class="citation"
data-cites="iannellaODRLVocabularyExpression2018"><a
href="#ref-iannellaODRLVocabularyExpression2018"
role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span> it is the W3C standard developed
explicitly to model rules and policies and also concerns the intended
requirements for which DUO was created. We specifically chose ODRL
because: (i) it uses RDF and is machine-readable; (ii) it provides
concepts modelling the domain-specific and legally-relevant terms to
represent constraints – e.g. spatial and temporal, and types of policies
- e.g. offers, requests and agreements, along with the flexibility to
use them in similar manner as the conventional contents and structures
of legal agreements; (iii) the use of ODRL can be validated<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> and a formal semantics
specification<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> is being actively developed by the
W3C ODRL Community Group (ODRL CG) <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> to ensure correctness
and consistency on the deployments of services that use ODRL; (iv) the
specification provides the ability to develop extensions through ODRL
profiles<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>; and</p>
<p>In addition to these, we also consider ODRL the most suitable
candidate for representing DUO concepts as it can be used without
requiring any of the existing DUO-based data use or request governance
processes to make radical and incompatible changes. That is, the
existing practices and processes by which DUO codes are added as
annotations to datasets and are used to request access to them can
continue without hindrance, and DUO stakeholders can choose which
aspects of our ODRL solution they want to adopt within their
practices.</p>
<p>ODRL, by modelling terms regarding rights and licensing, also offers
a compatible segue for DUO to be linked with relevant legal concepts,
for which we use the Data Privacy Vocabulary<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
(DPV) <span class="citation"

vocabulary of concepts, can be expanded or specialised for
jurisdictional requirements, provides legal bases and rights – including
from GDPR, is open and accessible, and can be easily integrated into
DUO’s use-cases.</p>

<h2 id="sec:sota">Relevant Work and State of the Art</h2>
<h3 id="sec:sota-duo">Data Use Ontology (DUO) and Aligned Efforts</h3>
<p>DUO concepts are structured across three taxonomies. The <em>Data Use
Permission</em> taxonomy, with base class <code>obo:DUO_0000001</code>,
represents permissions for purposes regarding data use. The <em>Data Use
Modifier</em> taxonomy, with base class <code>obo:DUO_0000017</code>,
represents ’modifiers’ or conditions to be applied in addition to
permissions. The <em>Investigation</em> taxonomy, with base class
<code>obo:OBI_0000066</code> from the Ontology for Biomedical
Investigations<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> (OBI), represents ’investigations’
or planned processes for which the data is requested for use. Along with
these, the concept <code>obo:DUO_0000010</code> represents the relation
<em>is_restricted_to</em> which is used to restrict or scope specific
concepts to some context, for example with domain as
<code>obo:DUO_0000022</code> representing limitation on use within a
geographic region, and range as <code>obo:GAZ_00000448</code> from the
Gazetteer<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> (places) ontology.</p>
<p>DUO is the result of earlier efforts to create codes regarding data
use, and use them as machine-readable information towards automation.
The first iteration was based on Consent Codes <span class="citation"
data-cites="dykeConsentCodesUpholding2016"><a
href="#ref-dykeConsentCodesUpholding2016"
role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span> which provided concepts representing
permission to use data. The second iteration adopted some terms from the
Automatable Discovery and Access Matrix<a href="#fn16"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>
(ADA-M) <span class="citation"
data-cites="woolleyResponsibleSharingBiomedical2018"><a
href="#ref-woolleyResponsibleSharingBiomedical2018"
role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span> framework which has similar aims and
concepts. The use of DUO as intended towards collection of consent for
dataset sharing and reuse is specified in the ‘Machine-readable Consent
Guidance’<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>. A brief outline and summary of DUO
and its use to streamline access to biomedical datasets is presented in
<span class="citation" data-cites="lawsonDataUseOntology2021"><a

<span class="citation"
data-cites="rehmGA4GHInternationalPolicies2021"><a

<p>The Data Use Oversight System<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> (DUOS) is a platform
based on DUO that provides semi-automated data access management for use
of datasets. It uses DUO annotations for adding new datasets and data
access requests, which are then matched using an algorithm based on
hierarchical compatibility i.e. permitted conditions identified based on
establishing subclass relations between request and dataset DUO codes.
The output of the matching process is then used as part of a review by a
‘Data Access Committee’ (DAC). An evaluation of DUOS’s automation
process found it to be comparable to decision-making by human data
access committees <span class="citation"
data-cites="cabiliEmpiricalValidationAutomated2021"><a
href="#ref-cabiliEmpiricalValidationAutomated2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></span>. DUOS is currently being implemented
in an ongoing large-scale pilot <span class="citation"
data-cites="schatzInvertingModelGenomics2022"><a
href="#ref-schatzInvertingModelGenomics2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a></span>.</p>
<p>Other uses of DUO include specification of informed consent for
health and genomics research in Africa <span class="citation"
data-cites="nembawareFrameworkTieredInformed2019"><a
href="#ref-nembawareFrameworkTieredInformed2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span>, along with ADA-M for representing
consent for health data sharing in a blockchain <span class="citation"
data-cites="jaimanConsentModelBlockchainBased2020"><a
href="#ref-jaimanConsentModelBlockchainBased2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></span>, and in CTRL <span class="citation"
data-cites="haasCTRLOnlineDynamic2021"><a
href="#ref-haasCTRLOnlineDynamic2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a></span> - an online platform that uses DUO
to provide dynamic consent interfaces and tools for large-scale genomics
research programs. Potential uses of DUO are described in the Data Tags
Suite (DATS) <span class="citation"
data-cites="alterDataTagsSuite2020"><a
href="#ref-alterDataTagsSuite2020" role="doc-biblioref">[13]</a></span>
where DUO is a candidate vocabulary in its framework for discovering
data access based on metadata, and as part of a roadmap for accessing 1
million human genomes across EU infrastructures <span class="citation"
data-cites="saundersLeveragingEuropeanInfrastructures2019"><a
href="#ref-saundersLeveragingEuropeanInfrastructures2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></span>. We found only one article that
provided a machine-readable metadata representation of information using
DUO - which used SWRL<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> to express the rules <span
class="citation" data-cites="amithExpressingExecutingInformed2022"><a
href="#ref-amithExpressingExecutingInformed2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[15]</a></span>. Further overview of DUO and its
relevant approaches amongst other rights and licensing initiatives,
approaches, and tools for health data sharing is provided by Grabus and
Greenberg <span class="citation"
data-cites="grabusLandscapeRightsLicensing2019"><a
href="#ref-grabusLandscapeRightsLicensing2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[16]</a></span>.</p>
<p>Of note in these identified articles and other resources is that we
did not find a clear example or workflow for how the machine-readability
of DUO should be associated with datasets, expressed as part of a
request, or how the matching algorithm should function. The article
presenting DATS <span class="citation"
data-cites="alterDataTagsSuite2020"><a
href="#ref-alterDataTagsSuite2020" role="doc-biblioref">[13]</a></span>
also refers to this difficulty in establishing the permissions and
prohibitions when using DUO, and mentions ODRL as an alternative model
providing clearer expression of permissions and prohibitions. The DUOS
framework offers the best (available) description of how DUO can be
applied, but does not offer much guidance on how the matching is
performed between datasets and requests annotated with DUO concepts.
From these, we establish the necessity of providing <em>RO1</em>,
<em>RO2</em>, and <em>RO3</em>.</p>
<h3 id="sec:sota-legal">Expression of Machine-readable Information and
Policies for GDPR</h3>
<p>Given that health data is personal data, it is subject to regulations
such as the GDPR as well as other domain and sector-specific laws such
as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act<a href="#fn20"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>
(HIPAA). By also annotating datasets with machine-readable metadata that
relates to such laws, automation can also be used to assist stakeholders
in identifying and meeting their compliance requirements <span
class="citation" data-cites="wenningComplianceUsingMetadata2018"><a
href="#ref-wenningComplianceUsingMetadata2018"
role="doc-biblioref">[17]</a></span>.</p>
<p>In this, the state of the art consists of substantial research and
development in modelling and using legal ontologies (see survey by
Rodrigues et al. <span class="citation"
data-cites="rodriguesLegalOntologiesTime2019"><a
href="#ref-rodriguesLegalOntologiesTime2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[18]</a></span>). Of note regarding the matching of
DUO dataset annotations is the policy checking algorithm for GDPR
developed by SPECIAL h3020 project <span class="citation"
data-cites="bonattiRealtimeReasoningOWL22020"><a
href="#ref-bonattiRealtimeReasoningOWL22020"
role="doc-biblioref">[19]</a></span> which offers a fast matching
algorithm based on subsumption between OWL2 concepts with logical
consistency and correctness guarantees. In principle, this is similar to
DUOS’s matching algorithm where the concepts to be matched in a policy
are pre-determined.</p>
<p>While ODRL, being a standard for expressing policies, provides
concepts with legal interpretation (e.g. <em>Asset</em> or
<em>Party</em>), it deviates from or does not contain terms such as
<em>Controller</em> or <em>Legal Basis</em> which carry important
obligations under regulations such as the GDPR. Vos et al. address this
by extending ODRL as a ‘Regulatory Compliance Profile’ which is used for
expressing policies associated with GDPR <span class="citation"
data-cites="vosODRLPolicyModelling2019"><a
href="#ref-vosODRLPolicyModelling2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[20]</a></span>. In this, the relevant concepts in
ODRL are extended with those from GDPR to construct ODRL rules
reflecting GDPR’s compliance requirements. In approaches providing a
vocabulary for use regarding GDPR, GDPRtEXT <span class="citation"
data-cites="panditGDPRtEXTGDPRLinked2018"><a
href="#ref-panditGDPRtEXTGDPRLinked2018"
role="doc-biblioref">[21]</a></span> provides a vocabulary of concepts,
and GConsent <span class="citation"
data-cites="panditGConsentConsentOntology2019"><a
href="#ref-panditGConsentConsentOntology2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[22]</a></span> provides an OWL2 modelling of
consent information. While these approaches are illuminating in how to
describe GDPR’s requirements, their use would restrict the created
policies to be operationally limited for application under GDPR.</p>
<p>In contrast to these, the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) <span
class="citation" data-cites="panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"><a
href="#ref-panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></span> provides a taxonomy of concepts
which can be used as jurisdiction-agnostic terms with an extension for
specific concepts from GDPR<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> such as its legal
bases and rights. DPV is, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive
vocabulary for modelling concepts associated with privacy and data
protection laws. It also offers different semantic serialisations (i.e.
SKOS, RDFS, OWL) which facilitate integration into use cases.</p>
<p>Two recent surveys provide an overview of existing efforts that have
utilised semantic web technologies to address GDPR compliance. The
first, by Kurteva et al. <span class="citation"

<h2 id="sec:odrl">Rewriting DUO using ODRL</h2>
<p>As presented in Section.<a href="#sec:sota-duo"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:sota-duo">2.1</a>, DUO
concepts are structured across three taxonomies with textual
descriptions of the DULs they represent. The goals of this work, in
terms of research objective <em>RO1</em> is to analyse this implicit
information and express it explicitly using ODRL, with the additional
goal of keeping compatibility with existing uses and workflows that use
DUO so as to not cause large disruptions to GA4GH’s current and future
activities.</p>
<p>We consider DUO’s primary attractiveness to be the ease with which
its concepts can be easily constructed from input mechanisms (such as a
form) and simply ‘tagged’ onto a dataset as an annotation. In this, the
textual clauses used to describe the concepts are based on well-defined
clauses from consent forms<sup>18</sup>. The role of ODRL, therefore, is
not to replace DUO, but to provide additional machine-readable
information for each DUO concept that provides explicit conditions
currently inherent in the textual clauses i.e. as conditions that can be
checked, verified, and consumed in an automated manner to perform tasks
associated with validation of dataset policies, querying to discover
suitable datasets, and to aid in matching requests with available data
and its usage conditions. We also considered the contextual cases for
representing additional conditions or information requirements such as
records-keeping by institutions or for legal compliance, for which ODRL
is also suitable as highlighted in our motivation.</p>
<p>Our methodology in this was to first
analyse<span>deleted</span><span>d</span> DUO concepts and textual
information to identify their relevant representation as ODRL concepts.
We then constructed rules expressing identified conditions and expressed
them using ODRL along with identifying three categories of ‘policies’
from GA4GH’s cases reflecting data usage, data request, and an agreement
based on compatibility between the two. We then constructed a matching
algorithm that utilised developed ODRL policies to compare a request
policy with a dataset’s policy to determine compatibility and to create
an agreement where both were found to be compatible.</p>
<h3 id="sec:odrl-overview">Identifying ODRL equivalents for DUO
concepts</h3>
<p>For each concept in DUO, we first sought to identify the constraints
or conditions by interpreting the textual description and identifying
whether it related to a permission, prohibition, or obligation, and the
specific context of how those are to be applied. In doing this, we
observed duplicity and overlap between DUO’s data use permissions and
modifiers as both contained <em>purpose-based conditions</em> without a
clear distinction between their semantics and interpretation, and
regarding permission or prohibition of that purpose as an indication of
<em>consent</em>. For example, <code>DUO_0000011</code> represents
permission and <code>DUO_0000044</code> represents prohibition for
“population origins or ancestry research”, with the former being a data
use permission and the latter a data use modifier.</p>
<p>We suggest restructuring the taxonomies in DUO to address this by
considering a single purpose-based taxonomy specifying research concepts
that either have variants for permission and prohibition (i.e. two
distinct concepts), or to explicitly provide a data use modifier concept
representing permission or prohibition that is applied over a specified
research purpose. This is based on DUOS’s data collection input forms
and ADA-M’s concepts where each research purpose can be individually
consented (or restricted) to, with possible implications arising from
lack of any permission or prohibition. For example, the DUO concept for
code <code>HMB</code> should be expressed in terms of it being a
<em>permission</em> for <em>purpose</em> of type <em>HMB</em> which is
also not a purpose of type <em>POA</em>. In this manner, the concept
(<em>HMB</em>) is better expressed and applied by exposing its
underlying concepts (<em>purpose</em>) and rules over it
(<em>permission</em>). See Section <a href="#sec:odrl-offer"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:odrl-offer">3.3</a> for
more examples of using semantic concepts to represent implicit
information in DUO codes, and DPV <span class="citation"
data-cites="panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"><a
href="#ref-panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></span> for additional taxonomies and
concepts available to further specify relevant information.</p>
<p>After analysing DUO’s concepts and identifying inherent conditions,
we formulated the relevant ODRL rules for expressing those conditions.
Where this was not possible because of ODRL lacking the required
concept, we created proposed extensions of its concepts to enable rule
expressions. For each concept, we constructed an <code>odrl:Set</code>
instance representing the specific rules (see Section.<a
href="#sec:odrl-set" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:odrl-set">3.2</a>), and consolidated these rules
into an <code>odrl:Offer</code> representing a collective singular
policy for a dataset (see Section.<a href="#sec:odrl-offer"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:odrl-offer">3.3</a>). A
complete collection of the interpretations made for each DUO concept is
presented in Table <a href="#table:DUO_ODRL_overview"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:DUO_ODRL_overview">1</a>.</p>
<p>We faced challenges in interpreting specific phrases such as “<em>is
limited to</em>” which imply that usage is permitted only within that
specific scope. If this interpretation is correct, then DUO should
clarify how potential conflicts should be resolved, for example between
rules expressing exclusive limitations and other permissive expressions
(e.g. “<em>is allowed for</em>”). Our suggestion is to take advantage of
ODRL’s ability to express these rules as code through which it can
explicitly express the underlying concepts and how they are applied to
create permissions, prohibitions, and obligations, and then using
existing methods for ODRL <span class="citation"

data-cites="bonattiRealtimeReasoningOWL22020"><a
href="#ref-bonattiRealtimeReasoningOWL22020"
role="doc-biblioref">[19]</a></span> to reason over them.</p>
<p>Currently, DUO concepts are limited to representing conditions for
data use, with suggestions referring to external ontologies for
additional concepts required for expressing scope or restrictions. For
example, <code>DUO_0000007</code> represents permission for
disease-specific research, with the recommendation to use the MONDO
ontology<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> for specifying diseases. Other
specific concepts mentioned in the textual descriptions but not modelled
explicitly include codes inherited from predecessors, such as
<em>CC</em> for Clinical Care Use, or <em>GRU</em> for General Research
Use. Expressing ODRL rules requires these concepts to be explicitly
defined e.g. as <em>Disease</em> for the disease-specific research, upon
which permissions or prohibitions are then expressed.</p>

<p>For our implementation, we identified and collected such ‘missing
terms’ into an ad-hoc vocabulary to permit ODRL rules to be expressed
correctly for each DUO concept. We recommend DUO to adopt these or to
create a similar vocabulary for explicitly providing the concepts and
their descriptions separate from the data use conditions in which they
are used. This also has the added advantage of providing better
documentation of information represented by those concepts. For e.g. by
modelling <em>IRB</em> as a concept representing Ethics Review Board
approval, it is possible to add information about what processes and
requirements are needed in such reviews. It also permits further rules
pertaining to ethics approvals to be semantically associated with a base
concept, e.g. to indicate it must be carried out prior to data use, or
periodically, or before publishing any outcomes.</p>
<p>For data use requests (specified as <em>investigations</em> in DUO),
we again found duplicity with concepts in data use permission and data
modifiers. For example, <code>DUO_0000040</code> represents a request
and <code>DUO_0000007</code> represents a permission for research for
specific diseases. Semantically, both refer to the same concept
regarding ‘research for specific diseases’, with the distinction of one
being a request and the other being a permission. Similar to the earlier
suggestion on the reorganisation of DUO’s taxonomies to be based on
research purposes, we also recommend applying the same approach for
consistency in concepts used for requesting use of data. Doing so
permits clarity, reduces disambiguity, and assists in matching as the
same concept would be associated with a dataset using
<code>odrl:Offer</code> and a request using <code>odrl:Request</code>
(see Section. <a href="#sec:odrl-request" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:odrl-request">3.4</a>).</p>
<p>Apart from the expression of conditions for data use and requests to
use that data, DUO concepts also have applications in <em>recording</em>
the outcomes of matching processes where access has been granted. This
is an important and yet unexplored area in the currently identified uses
of DUO, especially since any sharing of data would be expected to be
accompanied by information about the entities involved, provenance
associated with the grant process, and details regarding how the
conditions have been met at the time or later in the future. We present
how ODRL is useful in representing this information as instances of
<code>odrl:Agreement</code> (see Section. <a href="#sec:odrl-agreement"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:odrl-agreement">3.5</a>)
which can contain all the above information, and also be used in
automated approaches that can periodically check if the pending
conditions for an agreement have been met, e.g. fulfilment of publishing
results.</p>
<h3 id="sec:odrl-set">Data use restrictions as
<code>odrl:Set</code></h3>
<p>Each DUO restriction is represented as an instance of
<code>odrl:Set</code>, which must contain at least one permission,
prohibition, or duty, and one resource (here a dataset) to be a valid
ODRL policy. Its use does not grant any access or privileges, and only
represents a collection or <em>set</em> or rules that are indicated as
being applicable over the resource.</p>
<p>Interpreting the textual descriptions accompanying each DUO concept,
we used <code>odrl:permission</code> when the condition granted access
to data, <code>odrl:prohibition</code> when it denied access, and
<code>odrl:duty</code> when it specified obligations to be fulfilled. We
included DUO’s textual descriptions using <code>rdfs:comment</code> for
convenience, and indicated association with the DUO concept using
<code>dct:source</code>.</p>
<p>It was challenging for us to construct a valid policy which required
specifying the resource (dataset), because DUO concepts only represent
abstract conditions that don’t relate to a specific dataset. DUO also
does not specify how to indicate or identify values associated with
conditions such as specific diseases or temporal duration. To ensure
ODRL policies are always valid, and to clearly indicate how to later
apply or <em>instantiate</em> them for a dataset, we created the class
<code>TemplateQuery</code> whose instances represent a placeholder to be
substituted with the actual value(s) retrieved by executing a SPARQL
query associated with it through the property
<code>sparqlExpression</code>. In Table.<a
href="#table:DUO_ODRL_overview" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:DUO_ODRL_overview">1</a> these are indicated as
<em>Placeholder</em>. Examples of this can be seen in Listing <a
href="#list:request" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="list:request">[list:request]</a> for a
<code>odrl:Set</code> representing a DUO permission which is then used
in a request. The placeholders are used to indicate datasets and
assignees which are not known ahead of time, and which are substituted
with actual instances in real policies by using the SPARQL queries
associated with each placeholder.</p>
<p>Another challenge we faced was for indication of scoped restrictions
e.g. specifying the location when use is limited to a geographic
location. DUO contains the property <code>obo:DUO_0000010</code> that
describes the relation <code>is_restricted_to</code> which we interpret
as intending to be used to specify the specific values or instances,
e.g. diseases or locations, in restrictions. However, DUO concept
descriptions only state “this should be coupled with an ontology term
describing the (concept) the restriction applies to”, and we could not
find an example showing how it should be used in this manner. Further,
ODRL requires all constraints to be specified directly over the
<em>Asset</em> (i.e. dataset). Therefore even if this property were
available, its use would complicate the expression of rules in ODRL.</p>
<p>We discussed possible solutions to this, and identified four
potential avenues: (i) use of OWL class expressions<a href="#fn24"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>;
(ii) use of SHACL shapes to indicate a constraint; (iii) creating a new
ODRL mechanism that takes property paths as <em>Operand</em>; and (iv)
declaring the concept directly as an instance of the scoping concept
(e.g. for disease-specific restriction, the concept would be an instance
of the appropriate DUO class as well as the disease class). Each of
these have a bearing on how a condition is expressed, and on the
performance and capability of matching processes for comparing two
policies. For example, use of (i) would require executing an OWL2
reasoner prior to the matching process, and (ii) would require a SHACL
validator. In our implementation, we used (iv) by declaring the concept
as an instance of both DUO and scoping classes as it was the simplest
method, did not require any additional tools or changes to ODRL, and
could be replaced trivially with a different method in the future.
However, we explicitly indicate this issue as requiring further
investigation. The <code>odrl:Set</code> defined to represent DUO’s
concept on “population origins or ancestry research only” is presented
in Listing <a href="#list:set" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="list:set">[list:set]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec:odrl-offer">Dataset policies as <code>odrl:Offer</code></h3>
<p>When using DUO concepts to annotate datasets, each dataset can
contain multiple DUO concepts that must be interpreted in combination as
an offer for using that dataset. This is expressed in ODRL as an
instance of <code>odrl:Offer</code> containing the union of all
<code>odrl:Set</code> instances associated with DUO concepts for a given
dataset. In doing this, the <code>Offer</code> represents a single
policy for that dataset that can be used in matching requests, or
embedded as metadata to form a <em>sticky policy</em>. When creating
offers, each individual rule retrieved from the merged set policies is
maintained (as an individual rule) to facilitate the matching process
with rules from data use requests. This also facilitates potential
annotations for rules, such as specifying their provenance or adding
additional information for their interpretation within that offer. An
example <code>odrl:Offer</code>, which merges <code>:DUO_0000042</code>,
<code>:DUO_0000025</code> and <code>:DUO_0000020</code>, is presented in
Listing <a href="#list:offer" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="list:offer">[list:offer]</a>.</p>
<p>The construction of the <code>odrl:Offer</code> instance uses the
following algorithm:</p>
<ol>
<li>For a given dataset, retrieve all DUO data use permissions and
modifier concepts it was tagged with.</li>
<li>For each DUO concept retrieved, fetch its relevant
<code>odrl:Set</code> policy by using the <code>dct:source</code>
association.</li>
<li>If a retrieved policy uses an instance of a
<code>:TemplateQuery</code>, execute its associated SPARQL query, and
replace the instance with retrieved value(s).</li>
<li>Create an instance of <code>odrl:Offer</code> containing all
extracted rules<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>.</li>
<li>Add provenance information or other additional documentation,

<h3 id="sec:odrl-agreement">Data use decisions as

<p>Instances of <code>odrl:Agreement</code> are recorded outcomes of
decisions resulting from matching processes where access to the data has
been granted or denied. In this, the ODRL terms assist in specifying who
has granted or denied the access (<code>odrl:assigner</code>), to whom
(<code>odrl:assignee</code>), for what resources
(<code>odrl:Asset</code>), and the conditions over it
(<code>odrl:Rule</code>). The rules mentioned in an agreement are the
same specific rules and obligations as that specified for a dataset
(i.e. from <code>odrl:Offer</code>) and in a request (i.e.
<code>odrl:Request</code>). Through these rules, an agreement references
the specific DUO concepts part of the agreement. An example
representation of a data use decision as an <code>odrl:Agreement</code>
between a data depositor and a data requestor for the purpose of genetic
studies is presented in Listing <a href="#list:agreement"

<p>The following algorithm is used to create the

<li>Record the result where <code>odrl:target</code> property

respectively.</li>
<li>If the matching result shows a compatibility between the request
and the offer, then access is expressed as permissible by using a
permission with a constraint on the requested purpose for access, as
well as any other additional constraints, e.g., spatial, temporal, or
duties on the <code>odrl:assigner</code>. If the access is denied,
similar information is added to policy as a prohibition.</li>

<p>In the matching algorithm, we only considered the case where a
request is matched with a dataset’s offer. In a practical situation,
there may be a single broad request that could have potential matches
with several datasets, and it may be undesirable to run the matching
against all possible combinations of requests and datasets. To select
relevant datasets, a filtering mechanism can be used, such as based on
the request’s specified purpose, and the dataset’s policies could be
indexed in a database to enable efficient retrieval and matching. We
note these as candidates for future improvements in the progression of
this work.</p>
<p>Note that ODRL defines <code>odrl:Agreement</code> as the granting or
acknowledgement of a rule between the parties. This definition is
agnostic to the contents of that agreement, which means that the
agreement could be a permission granting access to a dataset, or one
that prohibits or denies it. While the above example uses the agreement
to represent a use case where access was granted, this definition makes
it clear that they can also be used to record instances where the
request was denied.</p>
<h3 id="sec:matching">Matching algorithm using ODRL for identifying
compatible datasets for a request</h3>
<p>The matching algorithm in DUO is based on comparing and identifying
compatibility between a dataset’s data use conditions with data use
requests. In our ODRL implementation, this is done by comparing the
dataset’s <em>odrl:Offer</em> with an <em>odrl:Request</em>. Given two
sets of concepts representing an offer and a request, the matching
algorithm can utilise two different and incompatible notions for how
access is determined. The first, which is the more common semantic
interpretation, is based on considering classes as sets and determining
access based on set membership. For a class <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> and its subclass <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>, a request for accessing <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> would also permit use of <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> since a member of <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> is always a member of <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em></span>. But a request for <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> would not permit use of <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> as not all members of <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> are members of <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>. This approach has been used in
matching policies for GDPR compliance <span class="citation"
data-cites="bonattiRealtimeReasoningOWL22020"><a
href="#ref-bonattiRealtimeReasoningOWL22020"
role="doc-biblioref">[19]</a></span> and for granting access to
resources in Solid <span class="citation"
data-cites="estevesODRLProfileExpressing2021"><a
href="#ref-estevesODRLProfileExpressing2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[26]</a></span>.</p>
<p>The second approach, which is what DUO describes in its
documentation, is based on identifying applicability of a concept based
on its specificity. For a class <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> and its subclass <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>, a request for accessing <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> would not grant access to <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> since it is more specific, but a
request for accessing <span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> would
grant use of <span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> as it is less
specific. Using subsumption as a criterion, the first approach grants
access when the data policy subsumes the request policy, whereas the
second approach grants access when the request policy subsumes the data
policy. Thus, both of the former mentioned approaches (i.e., <span
class="citation" data-cites="bonattiRealtimeReasoningOWL22020"><a
href="#ref-bonattiRealtimeReasoningOWL22020"
role="doc-biblioref">[19]</a></span> and <span class="citation"
data-cites="estevesODRLProfileExpressing2021"><a
href="#ref-estevesODRLProfileExpressing2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[26]</a></span>) can be reused here by
<em>reversing</em> the direction of subsumption.</p>
<p>Another consideration for the matching algorithm is the resolution of
permissions and prohibitions in terms of their order of evaluation and
conflicts. It is possible to interpret a policy in several incompatible
ways, such as first checking for permissions and granting access at the
first satisfied permission, i.e., a permissive model, and its opposite
where prohibitions are first checked and access is denied for first
satisfied prohibition, i.e., a prohibitive model. When a conflict occurs
for a permission and a prohibition over the same resource, the
resolution would be based on the precedence of one over the other. In
DUO, the matching algorithm is prohibitive since prohibitions take
precedence over permissions. This means that if a request either does
not satisfy a permission or satisfies a prohibition, the request is
denied. The policies are considered compatible only when all permissions
are satisfied and all prohibitions remain unsatisfied.</p>
<p>Based on these considerations, our matching algorithm consists of
checking for subsumption or satisfiability between
<code>odrl:Offer</code> and <code>odrl:Request</code> instances. We
adapted it from a prior implementation that also utilised ODRL in a
matching algorithm for granting access <span class="citation"
data-cites="estevesODRLProfileExpressing2021"><a
href="#ref-estevesODRLProfileExpressing2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[26]</a></span>. The algorithm simply checks
whether the dataset policy conditions are satisfied by the request
policy in case of permission, or violated in case of prohibition. If any
prohibitions are found, the result is that conditions are
non-compatible. If no prohibitions are found and all permissions are
satisfied, then the result is that the conditions are compatible. Note
that here the matching only asserts the compatibility of the dataset
usage policy and request, whose result is then used to make a decision
on whether to grant or refuse access.</p>

<p>Algorithm <a href="#alg:matching" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="alg:matching">[alg:matching]</a> provides a pseudo-code
representing the steps to be performed for policy matching. Please note
that the algorithm only represents a broad indication of actions and
that the DUO documentation lacks specifics for correctly interpreting
aspects of semantics. Given that this interpretation has a significant
impact on the decision-making within DUO’s processes and that DUO only
specifies interpretation of hierarchical concepts only for purposes but
not others (e.g. location, users, projects) – we explicitly identify
this as a topic that requires further consideration and investigation in
terms of better understanding and expressing the interpretation of DUO’s
conditions in approval decision-making processes. To remedy this lack of
information, except for the purposes in DUO’s concepts, we followed
existing implementations for legally relevant interpretation of
hierarchical concepts <span class="citation"
data-cites="bonattiRealtimeReasoningOWL22020"><a
href="#ref-bonattiRealtimeReasoningOWL22020"
role="doc-biblioref">[19]</a></span> where a narrower concept or a
sub-class cannot be considered compatible with a request for a broader
concept or parent-class. For example, a permission for city as a
location cannot be satisfied by a request for a region containing that
city.</p>
<p>The algorithm reflects DUO’s prohibitive interpretation in matching
where the offer’s prohibitions are checked and ensured to be satisfied
before any permissions are checked. The prohibition checking will deny
the request if any of the following constraints in the offer are
incompatible with the request:</p>
<ol>
<li>offer assignee matches<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> (<span
class="math inline">≡</span>) the request;</li>
<li>offer has a spatial constraint matching or not satisfying (<span
class="math inline"> ∩  ≠ ∅</span>) the request;</li>
<li>request has a project matching (<span
class="math inline"> ∩  ≠ ∅</span>) the project in offer;</li>
<li>there is a moratorium with a date in the future; and</li>
<li>request has a purpose matching (<span
class="math inline"> ∩  ≠ ∅</span>) the purpose in offer.</li>
</ol>
<p>If no prohibitions are found, the permissions are checked next. The
permission checking will deny the request if any of the following
constraints in the offer are incompatible with the request:</p>
<ol>
<li>offer assignee does not match (<span
class="math inline">≢</span>) the assignee of the request;</li>
<li>offer time limit on use has lapsed;</li>
<li>offer has a group-related research purpose, e.g.,
<code>PopulationGroupResearch</code>, <code>AgeCategoryResearch</code>
or <code>GenderCategoryResearch</code> and the request purpose does not
match (<span class="math inline">⊈</span>) it or the request purpose
matches it but the group does not (<span class="math inline">⊈</span>),
e.g. the <code>PopulationGroup</code>, <code>Age</code> or
<code>Gender</code> in the request are different from the one in the
offer; and</li>
<li>offer purpose does not match (<span class="math inline">⊈</span>)
request purpose, e.g., DUO’s general research use purpose
<code>GRU</code> in a request does not match a health, medical or
biomedical research purpose <code>HMB</code> in an offer as
<code>GRU</code> is a superclass of <code>HMB</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>These steps are checked for all prohibitions and permissions of the
dataset’s offer and if all permissions and prohibitions are satisfied
without violations, access to the dataset can be granted. The
proof-of-concept demonstration described in Section <a href="#sec:demo"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:demo">5</a> uses these
steps to match an offer with a request policies.</p>

<p>Table <a href="#table:matching-examples" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:matching-examples">2</a> presents examples of how
the matching process works for permissions and prohibitions in offer
with constraints for location and purpose. In a semantic web
implementation, the processes for checking equivalence (<span
class="math inline">≡</span>), intersection (<span
class="math inline">∩</span>), and subset (<span
class="math inline">⊆</span>) require additional considerations beyond
simply using <code>owl:sameAs</code> or <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code>
inferences. For example, to compare <em>location Spain</em> with a
request for <em>location Europe</em> using subset (<span
class="math inline">⊆</span>) for permissions or intersection (<span
class="math inline">∩</span>) for prohibition requires both locations to
be expressed in a manner where such ‘hierarchical’ or ‘set-based’
interpretations are possible. In this case, the matching requires
interpreting <em>Spain</em> is a <em>narrower concept</em> or a
<em>subset</em> of <em>Europe</em> – which can be indicated using
various relations such as <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code>,
<code>skos:broader</code>, <code>dct:isPartOf</code>, or even a property
such as <code>ex:inContinent</code>. Further complications arise when
legal jurisdictions are to be represented, such as <em>EU</em> which
<em>Spain</em> is a member of.</p>
<p>Therefore, an implementation of the matching process has to be
cognisant of such cases and be careful when implementing the
equivalence, intersection, and subset processes using conventional
semantic web interpretations (e.g. <code>rdf:type</code> and
<code>rdfs:subClassOf</code>). We strongly recommend using a
standardised vocabulary such as the DPV when declaring both offer and
request terms so as to ensure the matching process is accurate and
produces the expected correct result. To support consistent application
and interpretation of the standardised vocabulary, a specification is
needed that clarifies the expression of concepts and their
interpretation within the matching process – for example to indicate
that any location term in an offer or request <em>MUST</em> be an
instance of <code>Purpose</code> and <em>MUST</em> be related to at
least one concept in the purpose vocabulary using <code>rdf:type</code>
or <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code>. Using such a specification, the
matching process can then function by relying on these assertions to
interpret the constraints.</p>
<h2 id="sec:dpv">Expressing Legal Compliance Concepts using DPV</h2>
<p>The DUO concepts and terms used are different from those as used in
legal compliance tasks. By using ODRL concepts, the terms involved are
expressed in a language that has legal interpretation (e.g.
<em>Asset</em> or <em>Party</em>). The ODRL vocabulary also contains
additional terms which may be used with DUO for specific legal
interpretations, such as <em>ConsentingParty</em>,
<em>InformedParty</em>, and <em>obtainConsent</em>. While these terms
are sufficient for a policy to have legal interpretations, they are
insufficient to incorporate the specifics of laws such as GDPR which
assign specific roles to parties and require use of specific legal basis
in processing of data. At the same time, if the terms are made specific
only for a single law such as the GDPR, the usefulness and applicability
of the resulting policies would be restricted to only that law without a
clear recourse for adopting other laws and jurisdictions. To address
this gap, we utilised the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) which provides
terms that are intended to be jurisdiction-agnostic and can be used
without being restricted to a specific law.</p>
<p>To utilise DPV, we first performed an alignment between its concepts
and ODRL where DPV concepts that have an overlap with ODRL concepts are
defined as their subclasses (e.g. <code>dpv:Entity</code> is the
subclass of <code>odrl:Party</code>). This utilised the approach from
existing work regarding extending ODRL concepts for GDPR <span
class="citation" data-cites="vosODRLPolicyModelling2019"><a
href="#ref-vosODRLPolicyModelling2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[20]</a></span>. Where DPV concepts had no direct
equivalent in ODRL, such as for legal basis, we used them directly
within ODRL rules as instances of the relevant concepts (e.g.
<code>dpv:hasLegalBasis</code> as <code>odrl:LeftOperand</code>). Table

<p>Using DPV enables modelling rules regarding restrictions on legal
basis (e.g. consent), explicit acknowledgement of roles (e.g. data
controllers), limitations on third-party recipients, and indicating the
applicability of a specific law using <code>dpv:hasApplicableLaw</code>.
The DPV’s “technical and organisational measures”, which consist of
concepts such as data security and impact assessments, can be used to
further enrich DUO’s data use modifiers and create a clear delineation
between research purposes, measures required, and limitations or
conditions of use.</p>
<p>To explicitly specify GDPR as the applicable law and utilise its
legal bases and rights, we utilised the DPV-GDPR<a href="#fn28"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
extension which provides these concepts. Through this separation
(between DPV and DPV-GDPR), the policies can be declared in a
jurisdiction-agnostic manner using DPV, and made specific to a law such
as the GDPR by checking additional contextual information such as the
locations of patients whose data is involved, or that of the requesting
party. The separation also provides a clear path for applying other
jurisdictional laws and concepts on top of DPV by creating extensions of
its concepts similar to DPV-GDPR. Listing <a href="#list:dpv"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="list:dpv">[list:dpv]</a>
includes two ODRL offer policies that use DPV and DPV-GDPR to invoke

<p>DUO states the interpretation and applicability of GDPR’s
requirements is the responsibility of the adopter. This follows from the
complexities of determining their applicability before any request is
known, or because of the differences between stakeholder jurisdictions.
To assist with this process, we recommend adding or providing relevant
methods that are necessary to identify the applicability of the GDPR (or
other laws). For example, GDPR is applicable (to simplify the condition)
when an organisation operates within the EU or processes the personal
data of people in the EU. This translates to knowing the locations of
people whose data is being offered for use as well as the requesting
entity location.</p>
<p>Using DPV, both of these can be expressed using the appropriate
Entity concepts and <em>dpv:hasLocation</em>. This enables expressing
using ODRL further data use limitations such as data being available
only when the request acknowledges the applicability of the GDPR, or
permitting use only within GDPR-governed jurisdictions, and checking
these as permissions or prohibitions to be satisfied when matching a
request with a dataset by using a matching algorithm as in Section <a
href="#sec:matching" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:matching">3.6</a> along with an encoding of GDPR’s
requirements such as those from Vos et al. <span class="citation"
data-cites="vosODRLPolicyModelling2019"><a
href="#ref-vosODRLPolicyModelling2019"

class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>
extension providing Jurisdictions, Laws, and Authorities for DPV is
helpful in representing these conditions.</p>

    <span><i>Proof-of-concept implementation showing generation of <code>odrl:Offer</code> policies</i></span>
</div>
<p>For the matching process, the conditions represented in an
<code>odrl:Request</code> instance should be compatible with those
specified in the <code>odrl:Offer</code> instance associated with a
dataset. This means the permissions and prohibitions from the offer
instance should be satisfiable by the request. Once this is determined
to be valid, the policies are considered compatible and access can be
authorised. For data discovery, a request policy must be compared with
the policies of every dataset. This process can be made faster and more
convenient through pre-computations and optimisations – though we did
not do these in our implementation as it is intended to only be a
proof-of-concept.</p>
<p>The data discovery algorithm starts by checking if there is a
specific rule within a dataset’s policy for the purposes stated in the
<code>odrl:Request</code> – if a permission is found for a purpose <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> then access to the dataset can be
granted and if a prohibition is found then access is rejected. A similar
exercise is then performed to check for additional restrictions related
to other constraints (described on Table <a
href="#table:DUO_ODRL_overview" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:DUO_ODRL_overview">1</a>), e.g. restrictions on
the type of assignee of the offer, or on the location or time of data
use, and in case a prohibition is found then access to the dataset is
denied and in case a permission is found access can be granted.</p>
<p>In the event additional duties are imposed for dataset use, such as
agreeing to collaborate with the primary study investigator or providing
documentation of ethical approval, these are included in the
<code>odrl:Agreement</code> that establishes the final conditions for
dataset use. If there are conflicting policies, resulting from the
merging of different DUO permissions and modifiers, by default, the
prohibition takes precedence, similar to the default behaviour of the
algorithm for the case where no permission or prohibition is specified
for a particular purpose. In such cases, access is denied.</p>
<p>To record the result of the matching algorithm, an
<code>odrl:Agreement</code> is created with a permissive or prohibitive
rule to indicate the case where <code>odrl:Request</code> is allowed or
denied. This agreement policy also includes the date where the agreement
was created and/or reached, using the <code>dct:dateAccepted</code>
property, and the <code>dct:references</code> property to indicate the
identifiers of the <code>odrl:Offer</code> and <code>odrl:Request</code>
used to reach the result of the matching agreement. The depositor of the
dataset is added as the <code>odrl:assignee</code> and the requestor as
the <code>odrl:assigner</code> of the agreement. When the request is
allowed/denied due to a particular purpose, this purpose is recorded as
a constraint of the permission/prohibition in the agreement. If further
constraints are specified in the associated <code>odrl:Offer</code> and
are allowed/denied, these are also included in the
permission/prohibition of said agreement. In addition to this, if the
agreement in question has a permissive result, any duties that might be
present in the related <code>odrl:Offer</code> are copied to the
agreement as duties to be fulfilled for the allowed access to the
dataset. In this manner, the <code>odrl:Agreement</code> instance
represents and can be used to create suitable legal documents to
document and communicate the agreement based on the issued request. The
computational cost to generate such an agreement is not in the scope of
analysis of this work as it is highly dependent on the use case and on
the interpretation of the DUO concepts/rules, which DUO does not
explicitly provide, hence reflect the authors’ own interpretation of
such concepts. Therefore, this work focuses on representing the
information in an explicit manner through the usage of ODRL policies,
which can be made more efficient by using existing reasoning approaches,
such as by converting it to specific OWL forms that permit efficient
reasoning <span class="citation"

<h2 id="sec:discussion">Discussion on Integration into Existing
DUO-based Workflows</h2>
<p>DUO represents one facet of GA4GH’s ambition to facilitate
responsible genomics data sharing for health and medicine-related
research. It plays an important part given that its role is to increase
automation in data discovery and assist in ensuring data use is
permitted with accountability and oversight. Its use is thus part of a
workflow consisting of different components, processes, and stakeholders
who have differing requirements for how they use DUO. Any changes
proposed to the way in which DUO is modelled, is applied for dataset
discovery, or is used in automation for identifying compatibility with
requests may have consequences on these existing workflows. While better
design and performance are valid technological goals, they should be
evaluated within the lens of socio-technical applications they are a
part of. This section therefore discusses the influence and impact of
our work on existing DUO-based workflows and offers suggestions on how
this work can be best utilised.</p>
<h3 id="sec:discussion-design">Design of DUO concepts</h3>
<p>As we outlined in Section.<a href="#sec:odrl-overview"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:odrl-overview">3.1</a>,
the concepts within DUO have duplicity in semantics, and do not present
the conditions they represent as explicit machine-readable code. This
has an impact on the ability to use these for the expression of policies
and the implementation of automation in dataset discovery and request
matching processes, as well as the inability to further use this
information in other processes such as to keep records and create
documentation. In addition, the structuring of concepts requires clarity
on their intended role without overlap (i.e. permissions, modifiers, and
investigations), and should have separation of concerns (i.e. purposes
from modifiers). Through this, the use of concepts becomes clearer and
consistent, and provides the ability to introduce additional conditions
and constraints without impact on existing concepts. We recommend
following the ODRL model and concepts in terms of representing rules
(permission, prohibition, duty), and constraints (purposes, scopes)
separately from one another.</p>
<p>For further refinement of DUO terms and their interpretation, the
textual descriptions provided should utilise controlled natural language
(see survey on <span class="citation"
data-cites="kuhnSurveyClassificationControlled2014"><a
href="#ref-kuhnSurveyClassificationControlled2014"
role="doc-biblioref">[27]</a></span> for variety of approaches) that
match the expression of rules (as in ODRL) so as to provide a reduced
level of ambiguity and high-degree of specificity in the terms used.
Through these, the descriptions can be made self-sufficient in terms of
describing how they should be applied, or when (i.e. before or after
data has been released), which can benefit the non-technical processes
and stakeholders in understanding and using them. In addition, the
specificity of descriptions will also assist approaches such as ours in
constructing machine-readable rules that match the exact intention of
that concept.</p>
<p>By specifying policies in ODRL (or other similar policy-based
semantic models), DUO gains additional potential where policies may
encompass other requirements (e.g. legal), or have information about the
provenance of the data access committees and other relevant processes.
This would aid in maintaining documentation, using validation and other
forms of automation to ensure it is complete and correct, and perform
follow-up actions periodically or as contextually required. In all of
these, the benefits do not require everyone to adopt a large amount of
technical debt, and adopters of DUO can choose the extent of what and
how they wish to utilise our suggestions - such as adopting just the
ODRL rules, or its matching algorithm, or also the connection to legal
compliance using DPV. Our primary contribution is in demonstrating their
usefulness and providing a path for their development and adoption.</p>
<h3 id="integration-into-existing-implementations">Integration into
Existing Implementations</h3>
<p>We acknowledge that some of our proposed changes may break backwards
or existing compatibility with DUO utilising systems, and therefore
suggest any adopter to perform an assessment regarding whether the gains
obtained from such changes outweigh the cost of making these changes. In
our opinion, our changes do offer more advantages than disadvantages in
the longer term, and therefore they should be adopted gradually if not
immediately. We recommend the adoption of equivalent ODRL policies for
DUO concepts and the (re-)structuring of existing taxonomies and
concepts as the first steps. After this, systems such as DUOS can take
advantage of the increased availability of machine-readable data to
enhance their data discovery and matching algorithms.</p>
<p>We also acknowledge the value of DUO concepts in being simple for
stakeholders to understand and utilise, and their basis in ‘textual
clauses’ such as those offered in informed consent or data
donation/release forms. With this in mind, our modelling of ODRL
policies ensures that there is no immediate need to replace the use of
DUO concepts since the ODRL policies are complementary to these i.e. the
ODRL policy is linked to DUO concepts rather than replacing them
entirely. Thus, stakeholders who lack or have limited technical
expertise can continue to utilise DUO concepts as they have, with
machine-based implementations taking advantage of the increased clarity
and specificity of ODRL rules associated with those DUO concepts. An
important advantage this provides, that is not possible in the current
DUO-based implementations, is from the underlying constraints or
conditions being made explicit, thereby providing a larger avenue for
where further research into the use of automation and logic-based
reasoning can be investigated to scale the approach to larger and more
diverse use-cases than is currently feasible with DUO.</p>
<p>It also offers the possibility to encode as machine-readable metadata
what is currently external information i.e. (i) who: the data is about,
requested access, was granted access; or (ii) follow-up duties once data
has been released: checking whether it has been fulfilled, documenting
fulfilment or violation; (iii) legal obligations associated with data
use. All these information and factors are what DUO-utilising systems
currently utilise (such as DUOS) and will do so in any practical
use-case in the future. By providing a clear path for adopters to
express this information, the use of DUO can be made more systematic and
consistent – thereby also increasing the potential cooperation between
adopters and facilitating cross-boundary data requests and access as
envisioned by GA4GH as well as the EU’s Health Data Space ambitions.</p>
<h3 id="assisting-with-legal-compliance">Assisting with Legal
Compliance</h3>
<p>Currently, DUO or GA4GH do not provide information on how the use of
its efforts relates to legal interpretation and obligations, though they
have ongoing discussions for the same. This is a particularly
challenging task given the global scope of the work which encompasses
different jurisdictions and their laws, and that laws such as GDPR are
fairly recent in terms of how their obligations are understood to be
applied. We suggest the use of domain-agnostic vocabularies such as ODRL
and DPV to first provide a clear indication of how DUO and DUO-based
systems relate to specific concepts within legal terminology. By using
these within ODRL policies, DUO can provide what is effectively a
digital contract.</p>
<p>Further specific jurisdictional applications can then be introduced
as an extension of these. For example, the DPV-GDPR extension provides a
convenient way to specify GDPR’s legal bases and rights alongside DPV.
This reduces the burden on adopters who do not want to express this
information or do not want to express any jurisdiction-specific
information. For example, a data depositor who only stipulates use of
data should be based on consent without explicitly defining the
conditions for that valid consent can be expressed as a policy using
ODRL and DPV. The oversight committee or an ethics board can then
evaluate this further based on their knowledge of the valid consenting
requirements, and add additional restrictions or obligations to follow a
specific regulation such as the GDPR before permitting use of that data
by using DPV-GDPR.</p>
<p>This freedom also offers benefits for systems like DUOS that can
explicitly denote datasets as requiring GDPR-level consenting or its
applicability by adding relevant metadata to the dataset policy. Doing
so assists the matching process to also check for legal obligations and
compatibility, such as by requiring specific information about the
requester (e.g. a Data Protection Officer), or requiring additional
legal bases and safeguards for transfer of that data (e.g. outside EU).
Through this, DUO and its applications can gain a wider legal
applicability across the globe and also have the means and mechanisms to
address specific interpretations of the law. And given that all this
information would be machine-readable and shareable with the dataset, it
can be used by both provider and requesting entity for automation in
identifying and checking the fulfilment of legal obligations based on
utilising the existing state of the art.</p>

<h3 id="summary-of-new-articles">Summary of New Articles</h3>
<p>The two articles <span class="citation"

the way information is expressed and encoded as rules based on DUO
terms. The first <span class="citation"
data-cites="delcarmensanchezgonzalezCommonConditionsUse2023"><a
href="#ref-delcarmensanchezgonzalezCommonConditionsUse2023"
role="doc-biblioref">[28]</a></span> presents <em>Common Conditions of
Use Elements</em> (CCE) – a controlled vocabulary representing
<em>concepts</em> for use in data sharing policies. The second <span
class="citation" data-cites="jeansonGettingYourDUCs2023"><a
href="#ref-jeansonGettingYourDUCs2023"
role="doc-biblioref">[29]</a></span> presents <em>Digital Use
Conditions</em> (DUC) – a policy expression mechanism to specify
<em>rules</em> regarding conditions for sharing and reuse of
datasets.</p>
<p>Where DUO terms singularly represent both concepts and rules, CCE and
DUC distinguish between information and rules, which provides
flexibility in their use, enables granularity in their respective uses,
and provides a mechanism to extend them via <em>profiles</em> to suit
specific use-cases and requirements. An online tool demonstrating this
is provided at <a href="https://ducejprd.le.ac.uk/"
class="uri">https://ducejprd.le.ac.uk/</a>.</p>
<p>The CCE vocabulary consists of 20 concepts that were identified from
an analysis of requirements and conducted user studies. Its motivation
is to provide “<em>flexible ontologies that can capture complex and
conditional permissions in data in a manner that enables logical
computer-based reasoning</em>” <span class="citation"
data-cites="delcarmensanchezgonzalezCommonConditionsUse2023"><a
href="#ref-delcarmensanchezgonzalezCommonConditionsUse2023"
role="doc-biblioref">[28]</a></span>. The article describes four
requirements for CCE concepts:</p>
<ol>
<li>atomic i.e. each term should represent a single <em>concept</em>
as opposed to representing a complex or combination of several
concepts;</li>
<li>no directionality i.e. the term by itself should not specify
whether its usage means data reuse or sharing is allowed, forbidden, or
obligatory;</li>
<li>generalised i.e. the term should be a modular category without
any customisation, conditionality, or dependencies; and</li>
<li>the term should be “widely applicable and relevant”.</li>
</ol>
<p>The DUC specification <span class="citation"
data-cites="jeansonGettingYourDUCs2023"><a
href="#ref-jeansonGettingYourDUCs2023"
role="doc-biblioref">[29]</a></span> defines the expression of policies
where each policy contains an optional header section providing metadata
regarding the policy and a necessary core section containing one or more
statements. The header section also provides references to the datasets
associated with the policy, and information on the interpretation of
‘unstated conditions’ as either ‘forbidden’ or as ‘permitted’. Each DUC
statement contains four components:</p>
<ol>
<li>a condition term, which is a CCE concept;</li>
<li>a rule, which is one of <em>Obligatory, Permitted,
Forbidden</em>, and <em>No Requirement</em>;</li>
<li>a scope, which is either ‘<em>Whole of asset</em>’ by default or
‘<em>Part of asset</em>’; and</li>
<li>optionally a condition parameter with an optional value.</li>
</ol>
<p>An example mentioned in the article <span class="citation"
data-cites="jeansonGettingYourDUCs2023"><a
href="#ref-jeansonGettingYourDUCs2023"
role="doc-biblioref">[29]</a></span> of a DUC statement is
<em>Country</em> (condition) with <em>Permitted</em> (rule) for
<em>Whole of Asset</em> (scope) with <em>UK</em> (parameter). Another
example mentioned is <em>Time limit</em> (condition) with
<em>Obligatory</em> (rule) for <em>Whole of Asset</em> (scope) with
<em>Month</em> (parameter) as <em>12</em> (value). Additional examples
are available within the online tool documentation<a href="#fn31"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>.
In addition to concepts, DUC statements can also contain free text
descriptions to represent concepts, rules, scopes, and parameters. The
serialisation of DUC policies is expressed using JSON in both the
article and the tool website and documentation.</p>
<p>The article <span class="citation"
data-cites="delcarmensanchezgonzalezCommonConditionsUse2023"><a
href="#ref-delcarmensanchezgonzalezCommonConditionsUse2023"
role="doc-biblioref">[28]</a></span> provides a mapping between the 20
CCE concepts and DUO terms and indicates whether the CCE term is exactly
equivalent to a DUO term, or requires additional use of rules (e.g.
obligations using DUC) to be considered equivalent, or is a combination
of multiple rules (e.g. permission with one concept and ‘forbidden’ with
another) to match a DUO term, or has no corresponding term in DUO.</p>
<h3 id="comparisons-with-work-presented-in-this-article">Comparisons

<p>The advancements presented in <span class="citation"
data-cites="delcarmensanchezgonzalezCommonConditionsUse2023 jeansonGettingYourDUCs2023"><a
href="#ref-delcarmensanchezgonzalezCommonConditionsUse2023"
role="doc-biblioref">[28]</a>, <a href="#ref-jeansonGettingYourDUCs2023"
role="doc-biblioref">[29]</a></span> address similar motivations as
those we discussed in Sections <a href="#sec:intro-research-question"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:intro-research-question">1.2</a> and <a
href="#sec:sota" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:sota">2</a> regarding making information inherent
within DUO terms explicit and machine-readable form. The key difference
in the approaches is that while we focused on the reuse of existing
approaches (ODRL as a standard for rules and DPV for vocabulary), the
CCE/DUC approach creates a new vocabulary (CCE) and rule expression
mechanism (DUC). In this section, we compare the two approaches based
primarily on the distinctions between DUC and ODRL for expressing rules
and policies, and between CCE and DPV for providing vocabularies.</p>
<p>Without a formal specification, it is difficult to compare DUC with
ODRL. The way DUC is described and used in the examples and within the
tool provides the perception that DUC can be a simplified subset of
ODRL. This is because the structure of a DUC statement can be expressed
in the form of RDF triples which can be grouped together within an ODRL
rule. In this, the DUC <em>concept</em> is mapped to ODRL’s
<em>action</em>, DUC <em>rule</em> to ODRL’s <em>Rule</em>, DUC
<em>scope</em> to ODRL’s <em>target</em>, and DUC parameter and value as
ODRL <em>leftOperand</em> and <em>rightOperand</em>, respectively. For
example, the two examples of DUC statements stated earlier are
equivalent to the ODRL rules presented in Listing <a
href="#list:appendix-DUC-ODRL" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="list:appendix-DUC-ODRL">[list:appendix-DUC-ODRL]</a>.</p>
<p>In this mapping, DUC concepts being mapped to <em>odrl:action</em> is
inaccurate regarding the context of information as some of these
concepts do not represent actual <em>actions</em>. For example, while
concepts such as <em>Collaboration</em> and <em>Research Use</em> can be
considered actions, others such as <em>Time Period</em> and
<em>Regulatory Jurisdiction</em> are not compatible with the definition
of an action. This can be reconciled by treating these concepts as a
<em>constraint</em> rather than <em>action</em>, or by treating all
concepts as a <em>rightOperand</em> in a constraint with the
<em>leftOperand</em> being their defining context, such as
<em>Purpose</em> for <em>Research Use</em>.</p>
<p>The DUC rules map exactly to ODRL rules as follows: DUC Obligatory is
an ODRL Obligation, DUC Permitted is an ODRL Permission, DUC Forbidden
is an ODRL Prohibition, and DUC No Requirement does not have an ODRL
equivalent. Of these, the mapping of ‘No Requirement’ is problematic
since it is not possible to interpret “no requirement” in a deontic
sense by itself. In DUC while the header can specify a default
interpretation which is equivalent to an ODRL permission or prohibition,
ODRL does not support such interpretation frameworks and the article
also does not mention such use of the DUC header. Further, an example
from policies specified in <span class="citation"
data-cites="delcarmensanchezgonzalezCommonConditionsUse2023"><a
href="#ref-delcarmensanchezgonzalezCommonConditionsUse2023"
role="doc-biblioref">[28]</a></span> mentions “Collaboration with No
Requirement” with the interpretation that “The collaboration is
evaluated when appropriate”. We find this interpretation to be unclear
in terms of whether collaboration is permitted, or prohibited, or its
interpretation is <em>deferred</em> and cannot be clearly stated. In the
last case, it may be possible to express this in ODRL as a Permission
with a Duty to obtain prior approval to express that collaboration is a
possibility. In any case, we highlight the need to provide clarity
regarding the implications of such rules as this is necessary in request
matching algorithms.</p>

<p>The CCE vocabulary, which contains 20 concepts, specifies the
<em>atomicity</em> of its concepts as a core requirement. However, we
find that the concepts can be further generalised and structured into a
taxonomy based on their implied context – such as DPV’s distinction
between purposes, processing, or technical measures – as terms that have
<em>legal meaning</em>. For example, we utilised the DPV concepts which
match the terminology of regulations and GDPR by expressing DUO concepts
as purposes, processing operations over data, location of operations,
entities, and technical measures to safeguard data. With DPV we provided
a rich taxonomy for each of these concepts, and also gained the ability
to express jurisdictional concepts such as GDPR-defined explicit consent
instead of just ‘consent’.</p>

<p>In comparison, CCE concepts are still similar to DUO concepts in that
they contain hidden implicit information (e.g. Clinical Care Use and
Research Use are both Purposes), are not ‘complete’ in terms of
balancing the concepts (e.g. Commercial Entity is defined but
Non-Commercial Entity is not), and have not incorporated GDPR
requirements sufficiently (e.g. CCE concepts do not address information
security). In contrast, our use of ODRL and DPV addresses each of these
limitations. For example, Section <a href="#sec:dpv"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:dpv">4</a> shows the use
of GDPR terminology within an ODRL policy. A mapping of CCE terms to DUO
concepts is provided in <span class="citation"
data-cites="delcarmensanchezgonzalezCommonConditionsUse2023"><a
href="#ref-delcarmensanchezgonzalezCommonConditionsUse2023"
role="doc-biblioref">[28]</a></span>.</p>
<p>Comparing it with our mapping of DUO concepts to DPV/ODRL concepts in
Table. <a href="#table:DUO_ODRL_overview" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:DUO_ODRL_overview">1</a>, there are similarities
in the approach and analysis in that both express DUO concepts as a
combination of <em>Concept + Rule</em>. In continuation of this, we
provide a mapping of DUC terms with relevant DPV/ODRL concepts in Table.
<a href="#table:appendix-DUC-DPV" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:appendix-DUC-DPV">4</a>. In this, we focused on
identifying the core DPV concepts for each CCE term and how it is
applied with an ODRL rule (where relevant). From this, we can state that
the work presented in this article is compatible with the development of
CCE terms and that the use of DPV/ODRL terms to represent policies and
matching processes based on DUO concepts is therefore also applicable to
the use of CCE and DUC.</p>
<h3 id="concluding-remarks">Concluding Remarks</h3>
<p>Given that ODRL is an established standard, is extensible through the
<em>profiles</em> mechanism, and is also under active development – we
posit that utilising ODRL and reorienting DUC as a “syntactic sugar”
over ODRL can be a better alternative than the development and
maintenance of a completely separate rules language. The benefits of
basing DUC on ODRL also include access to ODRL’s distinction between
policies representing offers, requests, and agreements – as demonstrated
in Section <a href="#sec:odrl" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:odrl">3</a> – which is not mentioned in either
CCE/DUC articles. The use of ODRL as we have demonstrated in this
article also provides the necessary clarity and alignment with legal
compliance (via DPV) – which is necessary for health data reuse, and
which the CCE/DUC approach only addresses at a superficial level.
Further, we have demonstrated (in Section <a href="#sec:matching"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:matching">3.6</a>) how our
approach leads to a matching process that supports all three stages of
Offer, Request, and Agreement – in a manner that can be automated for
checking completeness (e.g. using SHACL) and correctness (e.g. using
reasoners). Neither of the CCE/DUC articles demonstrate how their
developments improve (or even clarify) the matching process first
mentioned by DUO. Finally, with CCE being the vocabulary for DUC
concepts, we find it limited in comparison to DPV based on the lack of a
structured taxonomy for organising the concepts, fewer terms, no
representation of jurisdictional or GDPR-specific concepts, and lack of
an extension mechanism.</p>
<p>Based on these, our preliminary analysis concludes that while the
work presented in <span class="citation"
data-cites="delcarmensanchezgonzalezCommonConditionsUse2023 jeansonGettingYourDUCs2023"><a
href="#ref-delcarmensanchezgonzalezCommonConditionsUse2023"
role="doc-biblioref">[28]</a>, <a href="#ref-jeansonGettingYourDUCs2023"
role="doc-biblioref">[29]</a></span> is an advancement over DUO
regarding separation of information from rule expression, we believe
several limitations still exist regarding the modelling of this
information. Specifically, the issues regarding how CCE concepts are
structured and their limited vocabulary, the development of DUC as yet
another rule language without compatibility with existing standards such
as ODRL, and difficulty in extending this language beyond its current
capabilities – such as to other health use-cases. We find the
contributions provided in this article are still of relevance and have
valid contributions that can be applied to further develop DUO, CCE, and
DUC while maintaining the existing adoptions.</p>
<h2 id="sec:conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Data Use Ontology (DUO) is an important initiative to enable
wider data sharing towards the goal of progressing health and medical
research. Its design and application are driven by the workflows and
use-cases present in a socio-technical system consisting of a data
repository, utilising a data access committee or approval board, and
maintaining compatibility with textual clauses and machine-readable
metadata.</p>
<p>We provide an argument for why the design of DUO concepts should be
enhanced in terms of making its data use conditions explicit – also as
machine-readable data and to utilise these in the matching of data use
policies and requests. For this, we have demonstrated the applicability,
suitability, and potential of ODRL as a standardised language to express
all facets of DUO’s applications. We provide: (i) ODRL rules for each
DUO concept; (ii) Integration of DUO concepts into an ODRL policy for a
dataset; (iii) ODRL policy representing a data use request; and (iv)
Demonstrating their use in checking for compatibility between dataset
and request policies. Through these, we provide a better mechanism for
the use of machine-readable information and its use in the automation of
tasks regarding matching requests with offers and creating documentation
as compared to the current DUO implementation.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, we also demonstrated how the use of DPV
within ODRL policies enables connection with privacy and data protection
laws without making it specific to a particular jurisdiction. For cases
where a specific law is needed, the DPV concepts can be easily extended,
which we showed for GDPR. Along with the descriptions of our research,
we also provided links to resources and a demonstration of its
implementation to assist adopters of DUO in assessing and using our
work.</p>
<p>Importantly, rather than suggesting a radical new method of doing
things, we started with the goal of constructing a mechanism that
complements DUO rather than replacing it. As we’ve shown, using ODRL and
DPV alongside DUO is feasible, and can be done with minimum disruption.
Through this, we hope to have our work influence and improve existing
DUO-related efforts, and in doing this to bring DUO and the GA4GH closer
towards implementing the EU’s Health Data Space vision.</p>
