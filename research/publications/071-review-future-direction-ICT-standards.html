<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Standards play a significant role in our daily lives, often to a greater extent than we may realize. The presence of standards plays a crucial role in maintaining the current level of organization in our lives. Standardization is one of the most important factors that has contributed to the development of our modern society. We would struggle to do simple things that we now take for granted. Consider what would happen if train timings and track widths were not standardized, or if we couldn't use our mobile devices once we were out of range of our operators' networks, such as while traveling abroad. We perform a large-scale quantitative analysis for papers dealing with (1) standards and (2) ICT data in three important databases, namely Web of Science, IEEE Explore, and ACM digital library, in this paper. These three databases presented 216 articles that were divided into five categories. The first category includes standard-related review and survey studies. The second category includes papers that managing information across both hardware and software standards. The third category contains papers dealing with energy management standards and measuring the classification performance of machine learning models. In the fourth group, publications are grouped that offer criteria for motivation to develop techniques to aid in the creation of standards for privacy-aware software systems. This is the fifth iteration of a set of standards for health information, and communications technology meant to promote compatibility and interoperability among separate systems.  In conclusion, our contribution provides a deeper comprehension of standards and fundamental attributes, as well as an essential foundation for future research. In addition, we demonstrate that standards play an important role in innovation.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Standards in this field have become increasingly significant as the
use and relevance of computers and computer networks has expanded.
Individual and corporate purchasers of information processing equipment
and software have begun to demand that the services and equipment they
buy adhere to specific standards <span class="citation"
data-cites="b1"><a href="#ref-b1"
role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span>.</p>
<p>Since the late 1990s, there has been a significant increase in
standardization efforts within the information technology field,
resulting in the creation of a larger volume of standards compared to
all other standardization endeavors combined <span class="citation"
data-cites="b1"><a href="#ref-b1"
role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span>.</p>
<p>Standardisation is widely recognized as a crucial factor in
facilitating the execution of research and innovation endeavors.
Existing standards are commonly employed in a significant multitude of
projects to enhance accessibility to cutting-edge knowledge and assist
researchers in incorporating the most recent advancements in
regulations, industry practices, policies, and technologies <span
class="citation" data-cites="b2"><a href="#ref-b2"
role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span>.</p>
<p>This study emphasizes an additional significant advantage, namely
that standardization facilitates the organization of the entire research
and innovation process by fostering discussions regarding the specific
deliverables of the project. The study also demonstrates that references
pertaining to standardisation within the call topics serve as a
significant motivating factor in the decision to incorporate
standardisation.</p>
<p>In recent years, Information and Communication Technology has
received considerable attention. During this time period, it was
determined that ICT could assist Standardisation in achieving their
strategic objectives. Additionally, academic research has contributed to
making Standardisation more efficient and better able to manage its
resources<span class="citation" data-cites="b3"><a href="#ref-b3"
role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span>.</p>
<p>Standards can have an underpinning or connecting function at the
level of basic research, such as agreeing nomenclature or basic testing.
Standards can help to advance research and innovation by enabling and
supporting areas including design, testing, compatibility, and quality
<span class="citation" data-cites="b3"><a href="#ref-b3"
role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span>.</p>
<p>Since this relatively small start, it has taken a long time for ICT
standards to be seen as an important part of the information society,
but they are now. Also, most people now know that standards are
essential to the economy<span class="citation" data-cites="b4"><a
href="#ref-b4" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span>, that they help
innovation, and that they are necessary tools for transferring
technology and knowledge<span class="citation" data-cites="b5 b6"><a
href="#ref-b5" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a>, <a href="#ref-b6"
role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span>.</p>
<p>Standards can have an underpinning or connecting function at the
level of basic research, such as agreeing nomenclature or basic testing.
Standards can help to advance research and innovation by enabling and
supporting areas including design, testing, compatibility, and
quality<span class="citation" data-cites="b7"><a href="#ref-b7"
role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span>.</p>
<p>Technology standardization refers to the systematic process of
aligning applications and IT infrastructure with a set of established
standards that are in line with the organization’s business strategy,
security policies, and objectives. The implementation of standardized
technology has been observed to decrease complexity and provide various
advantages, including cost savings achieved through economies of scale,
simplified integration processes, enhanced operational efficiency, and
improved IT support. Additionally, it streamlines the administration of
information technology <span class="citation" data-cites="b8"><a
href="#ref-b8" role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></span>.</p>
<p>Standards may encompass national, European, and international levels.
Numerous standards initially originate at the national level to cater to
local requirements, but subsequently gain broader acceptance across
Europe through the involvement of organizations such as CEN, CENELEC,
and ETSI. Furthermore, these standards may also achieve international
recognition through adoption by ISO, IEC, and ITU-T, thereby
facilitating global knowledge sharing and facilitating international
trade <span class="citation" data-cites="b9 b10"><a href="#ref-b9"
role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a>, <a href="#ref-b10"
role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span>. National standards in CEN and
CENELEC member countries are derived from European standards. Being a
fundamental element of the European Single Market, they exert
significant influence on the European economy.</p>
<p>Standards are considered to be voluntary in nature, as they are the
result of collaborative efforts between professionals from various
sectors such as business, industry, academia, and society. These experts
engage in a consensus-building and consultation process with a
standardization organization to establish these agreements <span
class="citation" data-cites="b11"><a href="#ref-b11"
role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></span>. Standards serve as the fundamental
framework for trade and have the potential to foster innovation by
facilitating the sharing of knowledge, promoting optimal methods, and
ensuring compatibility. They symbolize the principle of equal
opportunity, enabling users of varying sizes to participate in fair
competition. Voluntary standards possess the capacity to complement
regulatory measures.</p>
<p>The primary objectives of this study are as follows (1) investigate
the conventional and recent developments of relevant state-of-the-art
Standardization; (2) understand the role of standardization; (3)
understand the need for standardization to improve quality; (4)
understand the role of standardization requirements and challenges of
the ICT sector; and (5) identify the role of standardisation technology
and its impact on its environment.<br />
<strong>Research Questions:</strong> The research questions hold
significant importance in determining the search strategy and analysis
when conducting a systematic literature review. The research questions
(RQs) for this study were identified as follows:</p>
<p>RQ1. What does the current research literature reveal about the
Standardisation and ICT methods and topic?</p>
<p>RQ2. What are the main goals, vision, and trends for standardisation,
and what research may be highlighted in this field?</p>
<p>RQ3. What are the current research gaps in the field of ICT
standardization?</p>
<p>RQ4. What are the current motivations, concerns, challenges, and
recommendations for improving the standardization and ICT methods and
topic?</p>
<p>RQ5. Can standards play a more prominent role in the attainment of
regulatory objectives and the promotion of innovation?</p>
<p>A number of particular study topics helped to further define this
goal. These research topics were expanded upon and then utilized as a
foundation for the extensive research and analysis tasks completed, as
mentioned in the next section.</p>
<p>The principles of Standards are explained and analyzed in 2: of this
article. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. The
methodology, comprising the information source, standards for research
eligibility, the SLR, and the implications of publications’ search
results, are all defined in Section Reference Section 3. Along with
identifying the research questions (RQs) for this study, risks to
validity highlight significant obstacles to SLRs’ efficacy. The literary
taxonomy, standardization technology, and ICT were divided into four
groups from the queries of any object from three online papers. The
survey and review papers based on the most recent state of the art in
standardization and ICT describe and summarize Section 4. We present a
fresh research prospect for the standardization and ICT areas in
sections 5, 6, 7, and 8; Section 9 discussed the motivation, challenges,
suggestions, and a contemporary strategy for the standardization and ICT
fields. The Conclusion is presented in Section 10 to conclude.</p>
<h2 id="preliminary-study">Preliminary Study</h2>
<p>This section presents the fundamental concepts of standardisation,
institutes bodies, standards catalogues, and other standards.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-standard">What is standard?</h3>
<p>Standardization is the process of establishing and implementing
regulations, criteria, or specifications in order to ensure uniformity,
compatibility, and consistency within a particular field or industry.
Since there are so many different types of standards (national,
regional, and international), industries (agriculture, transportation,
nanotechnology, and medical devices), and topics (procedures, products,
services, and methods), it’s hard to settle on a single, universally
accepted definition of standards and standardization. That’s why it’s
impossible to settle on a single definition.</p>
<h3 id="standards-institutes-bodies">Standards Institutes Bodies</h3>
<p>Standards organizations often focus their efforts on specific
industries characterized by complex and specific requirements. Develop
and distribute comprehensive guidelines for a wide range of academic
disciplines. There are several well-known standards organizations that
can be identified, namely:</p>
<p><strong>National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST):</strong> is a US government department that contains a massive
set of software development and security policies, guidelines, and norms
that are constantly updated and publicized.</p>
<p><strong>The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC):</strong>
is a global standards body responsible for developing and publishing
international standards for all electrical, electronic, and related
technology.</p>
<p><strong>International Organization for Standardization
(ISO):</strong> The organization is a non-governmental international
entity that boasts a membership of 168 national standards bodies. The
organization is dedicated to the development and publication of
International Standards.</p>
<p><strong>IEEE Standards Association (IEEE SA):</strong> The
organization is widely recognized on a global scale for its
establishment of standards. The organization facilitates the development
of consensus standards by employing an inclusive approach that involves
active participation from industry representatives and a wide range of
stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong>ISO/IEC:</strong> ISO and IEC develop, promote, and maintain
industry standards, focusing on communications, information
technologies, and electric and electronics. Some documents are free to
download.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-standard-catalogues">What is Standard Catalogues?</h3>
<p>We have reviewed the existing standards from multiple standard
associations (IEEE AS, ISO, IEC, ISO/IEC). We designed a protocol and
followed it to read the standards.</p>
<p>Standard Catalogues are compilations of publications that contain
standards linked to a given industry, field, or topic. This Catalogue
can be a valuable resource for individuals, organizations, and scholars
looking to obtain and use important standards.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Structure of Standards Institutes Bodies
(Standards catalogues) To understand and interpret a standard, you can
follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A standard is reviewed every 5 years;</p></li>
<li><p>Technical Committees are organised through Working Groups, which
undertake the standards development;</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the standard: Determine the specific standard you want
to read. Standards are typically identified by an alphanumeric code or a
name that reflects the subject matter or industry they cover;</p></li>
<li><p>For example, ISO 9001 is a standard for quality management
systems, and IEEE 802.11 is a standard for wireless local area networks
(Wi-Fi).</p></li>
</ul>
<figure id="fig1">

<figcaption>Structure of Standards Institutes Bodies (Standards
catalogues)</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="understand-the-standards-structure-catalogues.">Understand the
standards structure catalogues.</h3>
<p>The purpose of the subsections is to describe the goal of describing
their main qualities. As a result, unless otherwise mentioned, when we
speak to "standards" in the following, we mean "catalogues
standards."</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The international standard that provides access to the standard
is: ISO/IEC standards can normally be purchased through the ISO or IEC
websites, or they may be available through your organization’s or
academic institution’s library;</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the structure: The ISO/IEC xxxx adheres to a
standardized framework comprising of sections, clauses, and annexes. It
is advisable to acquaint oneself with this particular structure in order
to efficiently navigate through the document;</p></li>
<li><p>Read the introduction and scope: Start by reading the standard’s
introduction and scope parts, which explain what the standard is for and
what it is used for. This will help you figure out what ISO/IEC xxxx is
about and what its goals are.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Table 1 contrasts the current catalogues standards, Standard Title,
Standard Status Descriptor, Indicators and Statements.</p>
<h3 id="other-standards.">Other standards.</h3>
<p>A "de facto standard," also known as a "standard in actuality,"
occurs when a successful solution is widely and independently adopted by
multiple industries within a market segment, and products made on that
basis are universally accepted by customers. Many technologies,
products, and services are based on existing standards, therefore formal
and de facto standards have an impact on our daily lives. Examples</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> De facto standards have the potential to
transition into formal standards when they are officially published by
recognized Standards Development Organizations (SDOs). Some examples of
these standards include HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which was
developed in the early 1990s by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in Geneva,
Switzerland, and is continuously maintained by the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C).</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Another example is PDF (Portable Document
Format), which was created by Adobe Systems in 1993 and subsequently
standardized by ISO (ISO 32000, ISO 19005-1:2005).</p>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> The QWERTY keyboard layout, which is
currently the most extensively utilized, was originally patented by
Christopher Sholes in 1864. The subsequent iteration of the Dvorak
keyboard layout, developed by August Dvorak in 1936, aimed to enhance
typing speed. However, due to the entrenched dominance of the QWERTY
layout, its adoption was not as successful, despite being natively
supported by most contemporary operating systems.</p>
<h2 id="materials-and-methods">Materials and Methods</h2>
<p>As stated in the Introduction, this research employed the Systematic
Literature Review (SLR) approach to gather relevant research articles
pertaining to two key concepts: "Standard" and "Information and
Communications Technology". The collection of research articles was
conducted using three reputable digital libraries: (1) Web of Science,
which offers a wide range of multidisciplinary research articles in the
scientific fields; (2) IEEE Xplore, which specializes in articles
related to electrical and electronics engineering; and (3) the ACM
Digital Library, which provides a comprehensive database for computing
and information technology.</p>
<p><strong>RQ1.</strong> What does the current research literature
reveal about the Standardisation and ICT methods and topic?</p>
<p>In March 2023, many searches on the three databases were conducted
using keywords (or phrases) such as "Standard", "Standards", "de facto
standard", "Standardization", "Information and Communications
Technology", "ICT", "Software", "Application Development", Apps",
"Techniques", "Methods", "Implementation", "Guide", and "Algorithm". The
keywords differed relatively slightly. Following that, the conjunctions
"OR" and "AND" were used to link these terms, which were then followed
by "Refining Information."</p>
<p>Figure 2 depicts the search queries utilized in this experiment. Some
results were removed because they were letters, magazine pieces, or book
chapters. The primary purpose of this exclusion was to gather the most
up-to-date scholarly literature on the Standard difficulties and
opportunities. The results were then separated into two categories: (1)
general and (2) coarse-gained. The latter is discussed in five
succeeding sections derived from the study findings, where Google
Scholar SE was used to establish the study’s direction.</p>

<figcaption>Research Methodology Guideline.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div class="paracol">
<p><span>2</span></p>
<p>The importance of the collected articles was assessed in order to
keep the most relevant articles from a huge number of collected academic
papers. Furthermore, the included articles were classified using two
criteria: (1) initial screening to find relevant results; and (2) three
iterations in the filtering process to remove redundant and duplicated
articles.</p>
<p>As previously stated, an article was excluded if it did not meet the
following selection criteria: (1) the English language was not used to
write the paper; (2) Standard and/or Standardization were the focus of
the paper; and (3) the research interest in the paper was only focused
on Standard without Information and Communications Technology.
Furthermore, after the second exclusion cycle, the articles could be
removed if: (1) the contribution of the paper did not consider any
aspects of Standard on Information and Communications Technology; or (2)
the discussion in the paper was solely focused on Standard on
Information and Communications Technology and did not consider any other
topic.</p>
<p>In this effort, papers were filtered extensively before being
classified into five groups based on the proposed methodologies for and
future research plans on standardisation. The categories were: (1)
review and surveys, (2) computer communication networks Standard, (3)
smart technology standard, (4) security techniques standard, and (5)
health informatics standard. Subsequently, further subcategorization was
performed according to the authors’ writing and presentation of the
articles to readers.</p>
<p>Our findings are shown in Figure 3, where we found 2772 research
papers based on user searches, of which 1128 were found in WOS, 551 in
IEEE, and 1093 in ACM digital libraries. The chosen articles were all
released between 2013 and 2023. Then, these articles were split into
three groups: (1) the 663 redundant articles; (2) the 1358 irrelevant
articles based on the titles and abstracts; and (3) the 216 articles
that met the standards for ICT search criteria.</p>
<figure id="fig3.png">
<img src="img/071-Fig3.png" />
<figcaption>Articles categorized based on their
contribution.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The statistics for the various categories listed above for the
articles about ICT standardization are shown in Figure 4. In the figure,
it can be seen that the 216 articles from the three databases were
divided into review and surveys (27), computer communication networks
standard (126), smart technology standard (19), security techniques
standard (19), and health informatics standard (25).</p>
<figure id="fig4">
<img src="img/071-Fig4.png" />
<figcaption>Published articles in between 2013 and 2023.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 4 depicts the statistics for the publications published
between 2013 and 2023. The figure depicts the number of research
articles published in each of the five categories for each year. It can
be noted that forty-four papers were published in the early years, such
as 2013. Between 2014 and 2018, the figure gradually climbed, rising
from twenty-five in 2018 to twenty-seven in 2019. From 2020 onwards, the
number of publications remained stable until 2023, when the number of
publications reached 32 research articles. This demonstrates a growing
study tendency toward the Standardization notion.</p>
<p>We created a Standardization taxonomy representation of the current
literature in light of comprehensive Standardization, which has been
produced in recent years, as shown in Figure 5. The presented approach
consisted of several Standardization, including Systems and software
engineering in Standard, Computer-Communication Networks Standard, Smart
technology Standard, Security Techniques Standard and Health informatics
Standard. explaining the proposed system in detail with the help of a
block diagram:</p>

<h2 id="review-and-survey-articles">Review and Survey Articles</h2>
<p>Recently published survey and review articles have provided a
comprehensive description and summary of the current state-of-the-art in
standardization and its applications. The research reviewed the
technological hurdles and standardisation considerations. This
category’s twenty-seven articles were broken into seven subcategories.
Their representative surveys of these standardisation studies are
described and discussed below:</p>
<p><strong>RQ2.</strong> What are the main goals, vision, and trends for
standardisation, and what research may be highlighted in this field?</p>
<h3 id="systems-and-software-engineering-standard">Systems and software
engineering standard</h3>
<p>The analysis and research documentation provides an overview of the
current understanding of standardization in systems and software
engineering technology readiness.</p>
<h4 id="programming-languages-standard">Programming languages
standard</h4>
<p>A programming language standard is a formal document that specifies
the syntax and semantics of a particular programming language.
Typically, when discussing real-world languages, this document entails a
detailed explanation using easily understandable language rather than
formal semantics expressed in mathematical terms.</p>
<p>Two articles<span class="citation" data-cites="b12 b13"><a
href="#ref-b12" role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a>, <a href="#ref-b13"
role="doc-biblioref">[13]</a></span> were presented that conducted a
survey on real-time distribution middleware, focusing on its adherence
to standards and its impact on the industry. The objective of these
articles was to offer technicians and domain experts a comprehensive
understanding of this field, while also highlighting important
unresolved matters and suggesting potential avenues for future research.
It also discusses the preliminary measures implemented in the
utilization of distribution standards in high-integrity systems. The
survey concludes by providing a comprehensive analysis of the advantages
and disadvantages associated with these various approaches. It also
highlights any unresolved matters, significant challenges, and potential
avenues for future research.</p>
<p>Other articles <span class="citation" data-cites="b14"><a
href="#ref-b14" role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></span> provided a more
detailed account of the early history, placing a significant emphasis on
hygienic macros. These articles then proceed to chronicle the subsequent
advancements, widespread adoption, and profound impact of hygienic and
partially hygienic macro technology in the context of Scheme. The story
prominently explores the dynamic relationship between the inclination
towards standardization and the advancement of algorithms.</p>
<h4 id="software-reuse-standard">Software Reuse standard</h4>
<p>Other subjects in this section Standardization of software reuse
results in increased reliability, productivity, quality, and cost
savings. Current reuse strategies focus on the reuse of software
artifacts, which is based on projected functionality, but the
non-functional (quality) side is also significant.</p>
<p>An article <span class="citation" data-cites="b15"><a href="#ref-b15"
role="doc-biblioref">[15]</a></span> was published that provides an
expert review of a framework that has been developed for the
implementation of a novel testing approach known as taxonomy-based
testing (TBT) in the domain of medical device software. This framework
presents three methodologies for implementing TBT and has undergone
validation by experts from the software testing industry and the medical
device software domain.</p>
<p>A comprehensive analysis was conducted on multiple software
engineering standards issued by the institute of electrical and
electronics engineers standard association<span class="citation"
data-cites="b16"><a href="#ref-b16"
role="doc-biblioref">[16]</a></span>. An investigation was conducted on
software engineering standards to identify the factors and sub-factors
that may contribute to diverse situations among members of software
development teams. Consequently, a total of 12 factors, along with 52
sub-factors, have been identified as potential contributors to diverse
situations among members of software development teams.</p>
<h4 id="software-life-cycle-processes-standard">Software life cycle
processes standard</h4>
<p>The implementation of standardized system lifecycle processes as a
means of enhancing efficiency is centered on attaining a consistent
level of delivery at the enterprise level throughout every stage of the
lifecycle. Furthermore, a standardized approach to system lifecycle
management not only offers a structure for effectively overseeing
individual systems-related tasks, but also enables the organization to
gain comprehensive insight into the utilization of system-related
resources, financial aspects, and project progress at an organizational
level.</p>
<p>Two articles <span class="citation" data-cites="b17 b18"><a
href="#ref-b17" role="doc-biblioref">[17]</a>, <a href="#ref-b18"
role="doc-biblioref">[18]</a></span> have been conducted on the topics
of governance, management, conceptualization, evaluation, elaboration,
and enablement. The set consists of 45 activities, each containing a
specified number of tasks ranging from five to eight. This standard can
serve as a fundamental basis for organizational training and guidebooks
pertaining to architecture management and development. A preliminary
version of the model’s architecture and its components has been
constructed, yielding partial results. The model has been developed
based on key references and best practices identified for Agile
Governance during the course of this research.</p>
<p>The author of the study <span class="citation" data-cites="b19"><a
href="#ref-b19" role="doc-biblioref">[19]</a></span> employs a SLR
methodology to identify and analyze the strategic process improvement
(SPI) initiatives within small and medium-sized enterprise (SME)
software firms. The findings indicate that a significant proportion of
software process improvement initiatives within small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) are implemented in the regions of America and Europe.
The SPI initiative was exclusively considered in Hong Kong, a country
located in Asia, where the CMM Fast-Track model was developed. Numerous
proposals have been put forth regarding Software Process Improvement
(SPI) initiatives for small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) software

SRMO, which tries to bring together all the terms and ideas related to
RM and give a more complete picture of risk. This paper gives three
examples of how this theory can be used in the field of software
engineering to show how useful it is. The SRMO was made by analyzing,
comparing, and combining the terms for RM that are used in different
industry-wide standards, frameworks, and models, such as ISO 31000,
COBIT, PMBOK, and CMMI. More important than anything else is the quality
of software. Software quality traits show what software is all about.
Quality management of the software creation process is an important way
to solve the software quality problem. There are already a lot of

using RFID technology in libraries over the last ten years. ISO 28560 is
a new standard that aims to provide a shared platform for an industry
that has grown up while different implementers have come up with their
own ways to store RFID data. RFID standards like ISO 14223, 14443, and
15693, which deal with air interface protocols, were mostly made before
they were put into use. However, standards like ISO 28560, which deal
with standardizing tag data models, were made after implementations had
reached a certain level of maturity.</p>
<p>IEEE 802.15.4 is another paper <span class="citation"

method that uses Walsh code to double the data rate. How well the system
reduces inter-symbol interference (ISI) IEEE 802.15.6 will determine how
the amplitude modulated FSDT technique is used. This study showed two
ways to cut down on ISI. Increasing the data rate made the

techniques hurt performance is not true. Using the better SVD method to
use channel prediction showed that it almost worked as well as using a
spatial filtering method with IEEE 802.11ac channel prediction. SVD was
a good MIMO receiving method for channels that changed over time.</p>
<p>In another study <span class="citation" data-cites="b121"><a

interrupt coalescing (AIC) was suggested as a way to save energy and
improve performance. The Intel 82579 NIC and the e1000e Linux device
driver have been used to set up EEE with AIC at the source. The results
of the experiments show that the energy efficiency of AIC is better in
most cases, even when performance is taken into account. In the best
case, it is up to 37% better than the energy efficiency of traditional
interrupt coalescing methods.</p>

properties of 60 GHz channels in a staircase environment with the
transmitter (Tx) side constant and the receiver (Rx) side moving are
looked at. Specifically, the paper looks at how the moving receiver Rx
changes the properties. IEEE 802.15.3c shows a
single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) model that can be used in an office
or meeting room. Simulation results show that the Euclidean distance
between the Tx and Rx is linked to almost every channel property.</p>

introduces a new type of acknowledgement called TACK and the
corresponding TCP extension, TCP-TACK. TACK’s goal is to reduce the
number of ACKs sent, which is exactly what the transport protocol needs.
Without modifying the hardware of IEEE 802.11, TCP-TACK can be used on
top of commodity WLAN to provide high wireless transport goodput with
little control overhead in the form of ACKs.</p>

engineering standards. We explored the factors that can result in
diverse situational scenarios, ultimately leading to software failure.
Each element is subdivided into related sub-factors that can affect the
effective development of a software system, resulting in software
failure<span class="citation" data-cites="b235"><a href="#ref-b235"
role="doc-biblioref">[235]</a></span>.</p>
<p>We draw the conclusion that numerous standards may not, taken
separately, meet all the security needs for secure software development.
Instead, more than one of the standards must be implemented as part of a
software development process to ensure the security of the final
product, whether for reasons of regulation or certification. Additional
investigation into these facets, together with the solution ways for
regulating them, can be carried out in subsequent work.</p>
<h4 id="concerns-on-smart-grids">Concerns on Smart Grids</h4>
<p>The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has introduced
the IEC 61850 standard for power utility automation to ensure a
significant level of interoperability, which is a crucial prerequisite
for Smart Grids and their associated components and devices. A
comprehensive approach to design, modeling, and implementation is
necessary due to the limited scope of addressing interoperability and
communication concerns<span class="citation" data-cites="b23"><a
href="#ref-b23" role="doc-biblioref">[23]</a></span>.</p>
<p>The future grids exhibit a range of novel network and communication
elements, such as inverters, smart meters, charging units, controller
devices, switches, breakers, and others, which offer improved and
advanced services. This results in the establishment of a highly
intricate network comprising various interconnected and intelligent
devices that necessitate the exchange of both information and energy.
Intelligent Electronic Devices (lEDs) are highly sophisticated devices
that provide advanced functionalities and services for effectively
managing the intricate and decentralized characteristics of Smart
Grids<span class="citation" data-cites="b236"><a href="#ref-b236"

<h4 id="concerns-on-functional-safety">Concerns on Functional
Safety</h4>
<p>Currently, there is a lack of a specific standard that directly
addresses the functional safety requirements of autonomous vehicles.
Consequently, numerous researchers have endeavored to employ the ISO
26262 standard as a framework for constructing software and hardware
models that align autonomous vehicles with functional safety standards.
The comprehensive examination presented various methodologies and
approaches that can be employed to incorporate functional safety
measures in autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles<span
class="citation" data-cites="b34"><a href="#ref-b34"
role="doc-biblioref">[34]</a></span>.</p>
<p>Many approaches are still in development, indicating the necessity
for a dedicated functional safety standard for autonomous vehicles.
Furthermore, the present ISO 26262 functional safety requirement for
road vehicles is insufficient for autonomous vehicles, which are more
safety crucial and sophisticated. Not only is a new specialized standard
for autonomous vehicle functional safety required, but the existing
standard’s ethical concerns and risk-based fallacies must also be
addressed. New safety and security criteria for autonomous vehicles are
urgently needed, and this is the scope of future research in this
subject.</p>
<h4 id="edge-artificial-intelligence-for-6g">Edge Artificial
Intelligence for 6G:</h4>
<p>The growth of services that use artificial intelligence (AI) is
pushing wireless networks to change even more. People think that 6G will
be a game-changer and that it will speed up the transition from
"connected things" to "connected intelligence" in wireless.
Standardization, software and hardware platforms, and application
possibilities are also talked about to make it easier for edge AI
systems to be mass-produced and sold.</p>
<p>With the standardization and global rollout of 5G networks,
researchers, businesses, and governments have started working on the
vision, use cases, and disruptive technologies for future 6G. With the
creation of wireless data collection, learning models and algorithms, as
well as software and hardware platforms, it is possible that AI will
become a natural tool for designing disruptive wireless technologies to
speed up the design, standardization, and commercialization of 6G<span

<h3 id="motivations">Motivations</h3>
<p>Standardization allows for the production of differentiated products.
Standardization certainly aids businesses in expanding their networks.
The standardization process generates research output that is ultimately
linked to the creation of markets for new technologies and can connect
to a plethora of existing standards and technologies. Standards can help
to establish a new technology and build its market since they are easily
referenced (for example, in procurement decisions). (see Figure 6).</p>
<p><strong>RQ4.</strong> What are the current motivations, concerns,
challenges, and recommendations for improving the standardization and
ICT methods and topic?</p>

of Things (IoT) on the standards for personal health</h4>
<p>Using the standards for personal health gadgets to build an
end-to-end remote monitoring platform One of the most recent innovations
is the IoT, which aims to help with health and everyday life (Healthy
IoT). Even though the bottom layers are coming together, the upper
layers, data models, and names are still being worked out.</p>
<p>Ultra-low power wireless protocols, such as ZigBee, offer notable
benefits in supporting IEEE 11073. Nevertheless, the ongoing advancement
of technology will inevitably exert a significant impact on the
prevailing standards. The recent release of BlueTooth 5.0 incorporates
several notable enhancements, including routing capabilities, extended
range, larger baseband frames, and improved frame delivery to dormant
end devices<span class="citation" data-cites="b209 b237"><a
href="#ref-b209" role="doc-biblioref">[209]</a>, <a href="#ref-b237"
role="doc-biblioref">[237]</a></span>.</p>
<p>Another invention based on 802.15.4 is a 6LoPan (low power IPv6 in
resource restricted networks) profile. Adoption of IP-based transport
layer technology might result in technology convergence, including Wi-Fi
(802.11); interoperability would be based on bridging and routing IP
networks; and administrators could be situated in the cloud. IEEE 11073
might be implemented directly on this transport layer.</p>
<p>Several organizations (standardization bodies, vehicle manufacturers,
and academia) have recently collaborated to define standards for
vehicular applications and build VANET-based communication systems.
Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) is a wireless technology
developed exclusively for usage in automobiles. These protocols (DSRC)
enable high-speed data communication between two cars (V2V) or between a
vehicle and a roadside unit (V2I or I2V).<span class="citation"
data-cites="b118"><a href="#ref-b118"
role="doc-biblioref">[118]</a></span>.</p>
<p>The comparison of traffic simulation and VANET simulation results
indicates that IEEE 802.11p exhibits a high level of accuracy. These
findings demonstrate the feasibility of implementing V2X communication
in real-world scenarios through the utilization of the IEEE 802.11p
standard. This implementation has the potential to significantly
conserve resources and enhance the overall comfort of road networks.</p>
<p>Potential future research endeavors may involve the simulation of
urban traffic patterns utilizing alternative Dynamic Route Planning
(DRP) methodologies. Additionally, the utilization of network simulators
and wireless technologies, such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE), could be
explored in this context. Furthermore, future research endeavors could
center on investigating the impact of the proposed methodology on
diverse traffic patterns observed in major urban centers and countries,
such as the United States and Japan, which are subject to distinct
regulatory frameworks and policies that influence their traffic
dynamics.</p>
<p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are being increasingly embraced and
incorporated into intelligent transport systems (ITSs) in developed
nations, driven by the ongoing pursuit of sustainable transportation
alternatives that provide enhanced energy efficiency and diminished
carbon emissions. The establishment of communication between electric
vehicles (EVs) and roadside units (RSUs) in intelligent transportation
systems (ITSs) and smart grids can be achieved through the utilization
of onboard units designed for wireless transmission. The establishment
of a standardized integration framework will serve as a robust basis for
the implementation of the plug and play concept within the Internet of
Things domain, specifically for electric vehicles. The seamless
incorporation of smart grid technology and intelligent transportation
system (ITS) components, such as charging stations (CSs) and roadside
units (RSUs) respectively, will provide additional validation to the
notion of smart cities<span class="citation" data-cites="b178"><a
href="#ref-b178" role="doc-biblioref">[178]</a></span>.</p>
<p>The implementation of Intelligent Traffic Systems (ITS) and
Autonomous Driving (AD) technology has necessitated the development of
the Cooperative Vehicle Infrastructure System (CVIS). This system
mandates that all vehicles possess the ability to comprehend the
immediate and surrounding traffic conditions. Specifically, it requires
the establishment of real-time, uninterrupted, and effective
communication between Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and
Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) networks. The technology that relies on
the coordination of vehicles and road infrastructure aims to enhance
traffic safety and optimize driving services<span class="citation"
data-cites="b120"><a href="#ref-b120"
role="doc-biblioref">[120]</a></span>.</p>
<p>The implementation of reliable and efficient V2V/V2I communication
technology is crucial for the successful integration of road
coordination technology in real-world traffic scenarios. In the present
context, it is anticipated that the Cardiovascular Information System
(CVIS) will progress in the subsequent areas: The vehicle wireless
communication network is characterized by its extensive scale and
intricate nature. Consequently, the utilization of network simulators
and co-simulation software becomes imperative in order to assess the
network’s performance, validate algorithms, and establish standardized
protocols. Undoubtedly, despite the considerable expense, it remains
imperative.</p>
<p>In the European context, the primary focus of CVIS research revolves
around leveraging advanced information and communication technologies to
expedite the research, development, and integrated implementation of
safety systems. This research places particular emphasis on
investigating communication standards and standardizing interfaces.</p>
<h4 id="wireless-standards-in-the-industry-4.0-domain.">Wireless

<p>Industrial wireless standards and communication technologies are the
focal point of this report. The analysis proceeds with a discussion of
the wireless standards’ security mechanisms and a summary of their
primary vulnerabilities and security issues. Discussion on the presented
topic, with recommendations and suggestions for implementing the various

<p>In certain ways, this allows for the selection of the best
communication technology for each and every industrial application.
Nonetheless, because no universal security methods can be applied to the
networking layer of the communication hierarchy, this variability poses
a substantial security difficulty. Individual wireless communication
technologies try to reduce this by implementing their own Physical,
Link, and Network Layer security procedures; nonetheless, many of them
are vulnerable owing to design faults and weaknesses. All of this needs
the creation of new unified security measures that are applicable to all
wireless communication technologies in the Industry 4.0 arena.</p>

role="doc-biblioref">[239]</a></span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Consensus: The consensus algorithm under consideration is a
synchronization mechanism that instills trust within the blockchain
network. The synchronization of ledgers is crucial as each node
maintains its own copy. Consensus mechanisms are employed to guarantee
uniformity of state across all distributed ledgers. The aforementioned
mechanism ought to possess qualities of reliability, functionality,
security, and real-time capabilities. Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of
Stake (PoS) are widely recognized consensus protocols;</p></li>
<li><p>Peers: Peers: The term "peer" refers to each individual node
within the blockchain network. The ledger is maintained and updated by
peers, who verify the validity of transactions prior to adding them to
the ledger. The primary functions of peers in a blockchain network
include hosting the ledger and executing smart contracts;</p></li>
<li><p>Smart Contract: A smart contract refers to a publicly accessible
code that is mutually accepted by nodes and can be activated in response
to specific events. Following the activation of the smart contract,
predetermined transactions or processes are executed, thereby expanding
the utilization of blockchain networks within business
operations;</p></li>
<li><p>Ledger: A ledger refers to a comprehensive record of transactions
and processes within the Blockchain network. In the past, ledgers were
widely utilized for record-keeping purposes. However, in the context of
a Blockchain network, each node maintains its own copy of the ledger.
These nodes update their copies with valid transactions and synchronize
them using a consensus protocol.</p></li>

role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a></span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Control in the Processing of Remote Calls or Data: Irrespective
of the concurrency pattern employed, ensuring the predictability of the
application necessitates the regulation of scheduling parameters,
including threads generated internally by middleware. Implementing this
approach would help mitigate the risk of encountering unbounded priority
inversions;</p></li>
<li><p>Allowing Free Assignment of Scheduling Parameters: In order to
maximize the system’s scheduleability, scheduling parameters should be
freely assignable throughout the chain of entities that compose the
distributed system.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for Various Scheduling Policies: While the fixed priority
scheduling policy currently enjoys significant popularity and widespread
adoption, there are certain situations where alternative policies, such
as EDF or flexible scheduling based on contracts, may be more suitable.
Hence, it is desirable for real-time distribution standards to offer
consistent support for configuring various scheduling policies;</p></li>
<li><p>Middleware should offer enough assistance to ensure the
predictability of the distributed system, limiting the impact of
priority inversion. One way is by limiting the number of network
communications to a manageable level; another is by facilitating the
setting of synchronization protocols for gaining access to crucial
portions;</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation of the Overhead Introduced by Implementations:
Documentation of Implementation-Induced Overhead: Practitioners should
be able to assess and evaluate each entity participating in a
distributed real-time application, including those formed internally by
middleware (e.g., internal threads for I/O management or network
messages belonging to metatraffic). The implementation must clearly
specify the role and influence of these built-in entities, as these
entities can raise system response times by consuming processing and/or
network resources. As a result, distribution standards should include it
as a condition for implementation;</p></li>
<li><p>Enabling Timing Analysis of the Complete Application:
Facilitating the Analysis of Timing for the Entire Application: The
execution of middleware occurs within the processor, however, it is
important to note that the temporal behavior of the networks
significantly impacts the overall response times. Furthermore, it is
often necessary to schedule both networks and processors simultaneously
using suitable techniques. Consequently, middleware should possess the
capability to define the scheduling parameters for both processing
resources.</p></li>

<p>The utilization of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology
spans across various industries, thereby necessitating intricate
standards in this domain. From a categorical perspective, RFID standards
can be classified into the following categories: technical standards.
Data content and coding standards. We adhere to a performance and
consistency standard and strongly encourage the use of standardized
practices. The topic of interest pertains to the standard electrical

absence of information renders operations unfeasible, while the presence
of accurate and timely information enables the execution of various
tasks and facilitates informed decision-making. Anticipating future
advancements in the field of information security is a challenging task.
However, it is evident that there is a pressing need for ongoing
enhancements in the standardization and management of information

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>The literary analysis has determined that a comprehensive study of
Standardisation and ICT has been conducted. The distribution of
employment opportunities has exhibited a consistent pattern of growth
over the years. Standards play a crucial role in fostering innovation.
In this review, we aim to explore the various advantages associated with
standards implementation. 1. Enhancing the evaluation outcome of the
research proposal. 2. Assessing the current state of the art through an
analysis of existing standards. 3. Effectively disseminating research
findings. 4. Initiating a global discourse on the research outcomes
within an international network. 5. Promoting the adoption of innovative
solutions in the market. 6. Ensuring market compatibility and
interoperability. 7. Enabling extensive and targeted dissemination of
research results. 8. Systematically documenting knowledge using a robust
and well-established documentation system. Some individuals may lack a
comprehensive understanding of the regulations set forth by
standardization bodies, particularly in relation to accessing standards
and the associated fees for participating in technical committees. It is
believed that these concerns can be resolved by enhancing the governance
and execution of standardization procedures. The issue of timing was
brought up, as it has been observed that in the majority of projects,
standardization efforts are initiated once significant progress has been
made, rather than being incorporated into the project from the outset.
While acknowledging its significance, the subject of ICT standardization
and its methodologies continues to be challenging to comprehend for many
individuals. It appears that this field is becoming progressively
exclusive to professionals and continues to be enigmatic to those
without expertise. Currently, there exists published research in this
field; however, there is a lack of a comprehensive textbook that
effectively presents the subject matter in a manner accessible to
students seeking to gain a thorough understanding. We are of the opinion
that there should be increased focus on standardization, particularly in
the field of ICT. It is imperative to incorporate the principles of ICT
standardization into classroom instruction to effectively impart
essential knowledge to students regarding this significant field.</p>
