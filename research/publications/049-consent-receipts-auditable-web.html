<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Consenting on the Web, in the context of online privacy and data protection, is universally accepted as a difficult problem, mainly because of its cross-disciplinarity. For example, any approach to online Consenting needs to meet usability, legal, regulatory, technical, and business requirements. To date, effort has been predominantly focused on meeting compliance with regulations and automation, and less on the true re-empowerment of users with respect to their personal data. One approach that has not seen sufficient research is the use of `<i>Consent Receipts</i>', which offer a new paradigm of recording interactions concerning consent and using them as proofs in future actions, similar to familiar use of a common shopping receipt. In addition to being a record, receipts encourage accountability in how technology handles consent and is beneficial for all involved stakeholders. For organisations, it assists with legal requirements for demonstration of valid consent, while for users it provides transparency and accountability by being a proof to be used against malpractices related to consent. Receipts also have uses in addition to those related to consent, such as for authorising the holder in exercising related rights.</p>
<p>This paper analyses the requirements, uses, and benefits offered by <i>Consent Receipts</i> with an extensive and broad literature review. Since receipts are a novel concept, we identify properties and requirements, and then new mechanisms necessary for the Web to support receipts. We then demonstrate feasibility of receipts through proof-of-concepts in three common real-world use-cases: (a) acceptance of a privacy policy and its subsequent changes; (b) choices expressed via consent dialogues or cookie banners; and (c) verbal interactions with Amazon Alexa.</p>
<h2 id="sec:introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Consent and its management is a fundamental part of online privacy and data
protection laws. A leading one, the European General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) <span class="citation" data-cites="Regulation_GDPR"><a
href="#ref-Regulation_GDPR" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span>, defines
requirements for ‘<em>valid</em>’ and ‘<em>informed</em>’ consent based
on the provision of specific information to the user<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and
the manner in which choices and preferences are expressed. Providing
information promotes transparency and encourages accountability by
providing the ability to inspect conformance with legal requirements and
(perceived) ethics. In addition, such laws also define the ability and
mechanisms through which a choice made can be changed at a later time,
e.g., to withdraw consent (GDPR Art. 7-3).</p>
<p>In practice, consent is approached as a legal compliance need rather
than as a user empowerment and engagement tool. This is evident through
the dysfunctional state of consent dialogues <span class="citation"
data-cites="sorensen_before_2019 hils_measuring_2020 machuletz_multiple_2020"><a
href="#ref-sorensen_before_2019" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a>–<a
href="#ref-machuletz_multiple_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span>.
Even though it is increasingly apparent that consent practices on the
web are largely non-compliant with the GDPR<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
<span class="citation"
data-cites="gray_dark_2021 santos_are_2020 matte_cookie_2020 utz_informed_2019 kretschmer_cookie_2021 soe_circumvention_2020 machuletz_multiple_2020 fouad_compliance_2020 nouwens_dark_2020"><a
href="#ref-machuletz_multiple_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a>–<a
href="#ref-nouwens_dark_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a></span>, the
notion of consent being a simple compliance problem that can be achieved
through the single click of a button is distracting: it needs to change
to something that is more user-centric and an enabler of benefits and
accountability <span class="citation"
data-cites="fassl_stop_2021 human_human-centric_2020"><a
href="#ref-fassl_stop_2021" role="doc-biblioref">[13]</a>, <a
href="#ref-human_human-centric_2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></span>.</p>
<p>For this, we argue that consent should be ‘<em>managed</em>’ using
first principles: that consent devolves into user empowerment and
transparency, and the web acts an medium for expression of information
and will.</p>
<p>Consent management has thus three key dimensions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>ensuring compliance with legal obligations;</p></li>
<li><p>user control of their personal data and consent actions over a
period of time (rather than a one-off action); and</p></li>
<li><p>a user-centric, seamless, and usable process for
actions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Though laws, in principle, are codified to empower users, the
ecosystem of consent practices is rife with malpractices. For example,
the web is riddled with dark patterns<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> that subvert the
individual’s autonomy and puts in question the validity of given consent
<span class="citation"
data-cites="utz_informed_2019 gray_dark_2021 soe_circumvention_2020 santos_are_2020 nouwens_dark_2020 matte_cookie_2020 utz_informed_2019"><a

href="#ref-soe_circumvention_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a>, <a
href="#ref-nouwens_dark_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a></span>. In
general, we see consent requests that are often malicious in their
disregard of user choice <span class="citation"
data-cites="matte_cookie_2020 gray_dark_2021 santos_are_2020"><a
href="#ref-gray_dark_2021" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a>–<a
href="#ref-matte_cookie_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span> or
practices that ignore privacy fundamentals and are designed for
commercial interests <span class="citation"
data-cites="human_human-centric_2020 obar_biggest_2020 bailey_disclosures_2018"><a
href="#ref-human_human-centric_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a>–<a
href="#ref-bailey_disclosures_2018"
role="doc-biblioref">[16]</a></span>, and implementations of dubious
legality <span class="citation"
data-cites="santos_are_2020 gray_dark_2021 nouwens_dark_2020"><a
href="#ref-gray_dark_2021" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a>, <a
href="#ref-santos_are_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a>, <a
href="#ref-nouwens_dark_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a></span>. The
net result is ubiquitous dialogues, banners, and virtually unreadable
privacy notices seeking consent from the user in every form and
interface they interact with, whether it be a website in a browser, a
smart TV, or an app on their phone.</p>
<p>Where companies satisfy the need of providing information and seeking
consent by providing a ‘<em>Consent</em>’ (or, often, ‘<em>Agree</em>’)
button, the reality is that very few users exercise their will by
actually analysing and reflecting on the given information <span
class="citation" data-cites="bailey_disclosures_2018"><a
href="#ref-bailey_disclosures_2018"
role="doc-biblioref">[16]</a></span>. Current privacy policies and
notices are paradigmatic: they are dense with ‘legalese’ i.e. difficult
to understand text which is antithetical to user expectations - and have
thus rightly been called “<em>the biggest lie on the Internet</em>”
<span class="citation" data-cites="obar_biggest_2020"><a
href="#ref-obar_biggest_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[15]</a></span>.
Combined with the inevitable slowness of legal enforcement, this
presents a challenge for achieving transparency and accountability. New
mechanisms are therefore needed to ensure transparency and
accountability on the web in a way that jointly benefits both services
and users, and also assists regulators in supporting their
investigations and enforcement actions.</p>
<p>Whereas abuse or malpractice of legal requirements is a problem, the
<em>technical</em> counterpart is equally challenging: designing
mechanisms and technologies for users to express and manage consent. The
current paradigm of <em>Notice</em> (commonly mistermed as ‘Privacy
Policy’) and consent encourages the practice of <em>consent once and
forget</em>. A service provider collects consent following some (legal)
requirements but leaves the user no recourse for later action or further
information (e.g., how personal data is used or shared). This is because
while the notice or consenting mechanism (e.g., a web popup), are
available for changing the choices made at a later time - such as by
visiting the website again and clicking some obscure button, the storage
of choice itself is tied to the specific application or device – such as
cookies stored within a web browser for that specific website. The
non-ephemeral storage of consent choices is thus practically unavailable
to the user and accessible only by the service provider (and in some
cases shared with their partners).</p>
<p>As a result, consent on the web is the storage of consent choices
which are accessible to a large number of companies and websites (via
cookies or hidden mechanisms such as Real-Time-Bidding), which the user
may or may not directly communicate with, and which is entirely
obfuscated and hidden from the users themselves. As cookies may be
deleted or overwritten, this results in no actual choice for users to
modify or withdraw or even understand their consent choices. Similarly
users have no knowledge of what consent choices have been signalled to
other companies and how to access that information to change their
decision at a later stage.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to create an accountable balance between the user
and the service provider, users should also receive and store a record
of their choices. Ideally, users should be able to track how any and all
of their personal data is being used regardless of what legal basis is
used. However, we argue that <em>at least consent must result in actual
user-empowerment</em> since it intended as a mechanism to do so, and
that this requires more things than mere dialogue interactions.</p>
<p>Inspired by how we use shopping receipts, this paper is centred on
<em>Consent Receipts</em><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> - a digital artefact produced for
recording interactions and particulars (what/who/where/why/how)
regarding consent.</p>
<p>In practice, a Consent Receipt should be an extremely familiar
scenario: upon consenting the user gets a <em>receipt</em> that can be
used to: (i) demonstrate what their consent or what it is about; (ii)
change their decision; (iii) request a change (up to deletion) about
personal data; (iv) reuse information in other contexts such as a
different consent interaction. This is similar to using a shopping
receipt to provide proof of transaction and use it to return a product,
request a refund, or claim tax-breaks. Thus, through consent receipts,
users and companies not only get more options in managing consent and
data, but also have opportunities for innovation in services based on
reuse of information available through a receipt.</p>
<p>In this paper, we show that consent receipts can be designed to
support many current requirements while being a familiar and easy to
manage process. We first overview consent receipts with a focus on human
and socio-technical factors regarding their usability and feasibility.
Second, we elaborate on the properties of receipts considering the
current state of online privacy and data protection and existence of
relevant laws. Third, we demonstrate their practicality through three
commonly experienced scenarios of website requests for consent (such as
through forms), cookie and consent dialogues provided by third-party
Consent Management Platforms (CMP), and for a screen-less device (Amazon
Alexa) where the receipt has to be sent through other communication
channels.</p>
<p>In this, we advance the state of the art, as outlined in
Section.<span><a href="#sec:relatedwork-receipts"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:relatedwork-receipts">3.3</a></span>, by further
providing a detailed analysis of requirements across disciplines and
creating a concrete proposal for the socio-technical utilisation of
consent receipts on the web. In addition to addressing the challenges
identified in , we also demonstrate the relevance and applicability of
legal and standardisation efforts (see Section.<span><a
href="#sec:relatedwork" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:relatedwork">3</a></span>) and its implications for
consent and consent receipts. Finally, the three real-world applications
of consent receipt validate their usefulness as - (1) a powerful tool
for legal compliance as well as user empowerment; and (2) a technically
and practically feasible solution for users and user-agents.</p>
<p>The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section <a
href="#sec:receipts" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:receipts">2</a> presents a detailed notion of
Consent Receipts and how a careful design can meet technical, legal and
usability requirements. Section <a href="#sec:relatedwork"

presents the wider related work in online Consenting. Section <a

concludes with a discussion on the future of Consent Receipts.</p>
<h2 id="sec:receipts">Consent Receipts</h2>
<p>This section elaborates on the different perspectives for
understanding the role of Consent Receipt: as a user-enabling artefact,
its use in the the ecosystem of personal data, and potential
benefits.</p>
<h3 id="sec:receipts-artefact">Receipt as an Artefact</h3>
<p>A Consent Receipt is an artefact recording the state and context of a
‘<em>transaction regarding consent</em>’. This is similar to a
conventional shopping receipt that records the exchange of money for a
service or a product. Traditionally provided using paper, receipts are
now also provisioned electronically with possibilities of copies for
both sellers and consumers. Because of its inherent simplicity and
familiarity as a mechanism to the average user, a receipt can have the
following immediate properties:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>small, portable, and easily stored - which is necessary for
implementing and using receipts by user-agents such as web browsers and
smartphone devices;</p></li>
<li><p>self-sufficient by containing all required (meta)data concerning
the transaction - allowing use in investigations and audits by
authorities;</p></li>
<li><p>instantly generated with little preconditions or information
outside of the transaction itself - which satisfies the requirements to
record consent without requiring additional interactions such as the
creation of an account;</p></li>
<li><p>acts as an actionable artefact, such as proving ‘ownership’ of
consent in future interactions such as changing choices made or
withdrawing it completely;</p></li>
<li><p>creation and provision of <em>self-service points</em> in which
the receipt is used as a self-sufficient means of authentication to
provide related services; and</p></li>
<li><p>can be anonymous in itself without losing its efficacy where it
may not need any identifying attributes since a receipt can be
implemented as <em>bearer token</em> and embed verifiability without
sacrificing privacy.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is intuitive to draw immediate parallels between use of receipts
and the ‘privacy paradox’ where users (generally) value online privacy
but will nevertheless use services that compromise their privacy. To
reconcile this, one perspective is to consider the user as a stakeholder
in the value-creation process based on their use of consent to provide
data in return of services <span class="citation"
data-cites="human_human-centric_2020"><a
href="#ref-human_human-centric_2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></span>. Here the opposing notions of
consent as a transaction and as a mechanism for user to choose their
privacy can be balanced by restating the argument to instead ask whether
users are empowered to choose how they want to transact their privacy.
This notion further makes the idea of Consent Receipts an intuitive one,
and works to abolish the widely accepted practice of “the user is the
product”. Therefore receipts also apply here given that it records the
interaction or transaction for all parties involved, and is usable as
the canonical ‘proof’ to recall or reuse this information at a later
date. More importantly, this goes beyond simply providing a record of
consent by following the implications of rights the receipt-holder is
empowered with.</p>
<h4 id="sec:receipts-decouple-identity">Receipts Decouple Identity from
Authentication</h4>
<p>Receipts are an especially elegant solution for decoupling identity
from authentication of the individual, and are useful where there is a
lack of other means or available solutions require disproportionate
measures. This is particularly important for situations where the
interactions are ephemeral or short-lived, such as a casual website
visitor where follow-up interactions for consent usually necessitate the
creation of an account, and even then the account is only useful for the
company rather than all the entities associated with consent (e.g. third
parties).</p>
<p>A receipt, if designed as a secure bearer token <span
class="citation" data-cites="jesus_towards_2020"><a
href="#ref-jesus_towards_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[17]</a></span>,
provides a straightforward solution for both the service provider and
the user to communicate and interact in a truly anonymous, but
verifiable and secure, fashion. It decouples the identification and
authentication problems from reusing sensitive identity information
(such as ID cards) and instead provides a solution scoped to the context
whereby the parties involved can determine their own methods for
identity and identification.</p>
<p>If the receipts are utilised as bearer tokens, service providers can
make available control panels that require no accounts or additional
efforts in proving the identity and ownership for personal data. Such
<em>self-service points</em> consist of a location or process for using
the receipts to some end, such as - requests for deletion or correction,
conflict resolution, or tracing personal data as it is shared. This is
an important benefit as it mitigates the ongoing common practice of
presenting disproportional hurdles to the exercising of rights by
demanding proof of identity via sensitive shared documents such as
identity cards or passport which themselves result in additional legal
obligations <span class="citation"
data-cites="urban_study_2019 kroger_how_2020"><a
href="#ref-urban_study_2019" role="doc-biblioref">[18]</a>, <a
href="#ref-kroger_how_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[19]</a></span>. In
dissuading such practices, not only are users better placed to interact
regarding their own data and privacy, but also benefit from not being
exposed to security and privacy risks arising from potential of data
leakage and identity fraud <span class="citation"
data-cites="martino_personal_2019"><a href="#ref-martino_personal_2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[20]</a></span>.</p>
<h3 id="sec:receipts-ecosystem">Receipts in the Wider Ecosystem</h3>
<p>Privacy and Data Protection is an ecosystem that has three
(simplified) key entities: the Users, the Service Providers and, to use
a broad term - <em>Watchdogs</em> that consist of entities investigating
consent-related practices, such as national or international regulatory
authorities, privacy and consumer interest groups, and ad-hoc
communities. Receipts have clear value and benefits to each of the three
categories of entities as presented in the following subsections.</p>
<h4 id="sec:receipts-ecosystem-suers">Benefits to Users and Service
Providers</h4>
<p>For <em>users</em>, receipts provide proof of consent and context,
and thereby permit storing and analysing their own activities and data
sharing practices, exercising communication and rights with service
providers, and more importantly, provide evidence in challenging
malpractices involving their data.</p>
<p>Receipts benefit <em>Service providers</em> in at least two ways.
First, as a bearer token users can anonymously authenticate in the role
of "owner of personal data", which lessens the compliance burden to hold
additional personal information that can further lead to additional
compliance tasks and potential for data breaches. GDPR, in particular,
emphasises the principle of retaining and using minimal data for
required purposes, and stresses not requiring additional data purely for
the sake of provisioning rights where other alternatives are available
<span class="citation"
data-cites="veale_when_2018 ausloos_getting_2019"><a
href="#ref-veale_when_2018" role="doc-biblioref">[21]</a>, <a
href="#ref-ausloos_getting_2019" role="doc-biblioref">[22]</a></span>.
Second, receipts vastly simplify fulfilling legal obligations related to
recording and demonstrating valid consent (GDPR Art.7) by providing the
mechanism to create, store, and use an authoritative copy of a record of
consent. Further, the use of semantics and metadata in a receipt
provides an opportunity to utilise it as machine-readable information
towards (semi-)automated enforcing of legal compliance <span
class="citation" data-cites="wenning_compliance_2018"><a
href="#ref-wenning_compliance_2018"
role="doc-biblioref">[23]</a></span>. That this approach leads to
interoperability and creation of standards is evident from the existence
of existing efforts leading towards the same (see Section.<a
href="#sec:relatedwork-standards" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:relatedwork-standards">3.4</a>).</p>
<h4 id="sec:receipts-self-service-points">Innovation as Self-Service
Points</h4>
<p>Receipts, by containing information related to authentication of
identity, can lead to better processes for rights management and
interactions between service providers and users through self-service
points where the users only need to provide a valid and verifiable
receipt to a) identify themselves implicitly; and b) access services and
processes associated with the information in the receipt. This can
permit a wide range of automated and semi-automated interactions, not
only for consent - such as its withdrawal, re-confirmation, or change of
choices and preferences -, but also in other related areas such as data
portability or access requests, and customer care. As we later show in
our implementations in <a href="#sec:usecases" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:usecases">5</a>, such automation opportunities are
easily capitalised and with little user intervention.</p>
<h4 id="sec:receipts-ecosystem-watchdogs">Benefits for Watchdogs</h4>
<p>As for Watchdogs, receipts provide a systematic and machine-readable
mechanism to gather and inspect data regarding practices and compliance
from both the service provider and the user. More importantly, it
provides valuable evidence in resolving disputes. For example, Facebook
recently claimed that users willingly chose the data collection and
sharing practices on its platforms based on their use of prominent
banners and consent dialogues. However, users claim they did agree to
targeted advertisements but were not aware of the extent regarding being
profiled and surveilled <span class="citation"
data-cites="turow_opinion_2019"><a href="#ref-turow_opinion_2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[24]</a></span>. In another case, there was a
dispute between a social network that was using post addresses to send
letters on behalf of registered users<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. These users say they
never accepted, or were aware of, that use of their personal data (such
as addresses). The social network insists consent was taken by
displaying a prominent banner.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to settle such disputes without a thorough
investigation of practices. Furthermore, such investigations are costly
as they need time and manpower to identify, acquire, and analyse the
forensic artefacts used <em>at the time of consenting</em>, and <em>for
the user in question</em>. This is further complicated by the users have
no information or mechanism to present their version of events, and as
such the only option is implicitly trusting the service provider and
their records.</p>
<p>A receipt has the potential of trivially resolving these matters if
both parties are required to produce (verifiable) receipts. The
expectation is that, in the vast majority of cases, it is only a matter
of comparing and verifying what information was provided, where, and
when. It is not too dissimilar to the case of a customer claiming they
bought a certain item at a store and the store saying it was bought
elsewhere. If not for complete verification of facts, such as how the
request was presented or how the consent was expressed, receipts are
still a helpful tool in identifying the direction for further
investigation based on information within the receipt representing
established pertinent facts.</p>
<h4 id="encouraging-accountability-and-user-empowerment">Encouraging
Accountability and User-Empowerment</h4>
<p>We stress that consent receipts are inspired in the very familiar
notion of shopping receipts. Nevertheless, given that consent receipts
are a fairly new concept, they represent a learning curve for use by
users in terms of understanding what they are, how to use them, and how
it benefits them. However, the machine-readable nature of consent
receipts represents a great potential for automation and tooling to
support the user in reducing ’consent fatigue’; it would further help
with empowerment against predatory malpractices, especially those
surrounding cookie and consent dialogues on the web.</p>
<p>As we show in later sections, consent receipts open new possibilities
regarding user empowerment tools, such as web browsers, where receipts
can be automatically generated following a transaction such as
acceptance in a cookie dialogue. In this, the role of the user can range
between extremes: from a completely transparent and oblivious
experience, to a user that frequently and in detail inspects each
receipt (and they could be numerous). We anticipate that browsers will
be able handle all relevant aspects of the process – for example, there
would be a receipt wallet with rich visualisation functionalities and
access to self-service points (as discussed later). A major difference
receipts can potentially bring is a universal method for managing
permissions granted to various sites on the web – e.g. where web
browsers provides a dashboard of receipts and allows the user to
understand their privacy practices better whilst allowing easier
single-click withdrawals in self-service portals. This provides users
with an important resource in that they now have a directly actionable
resource they can use to revoke their consent or even challenge a claim
with the service providers or authorities without length technical
investigations.</p>
<p>Receipts also address the issue of fraudulent consent in important
situations where there is sensitive personal data involved. It would
further help when consent relates to exploitative practices such as
tacit agreements for large-scale invasive surveillance on the web. By
capturing such agreements within consent receipts, users would be
explicitly asking ‘proof’ of what they have exactly agreed to. This
would encourage service providers to uphold accountability and
transparency, similar to the way asking for shopping receipts encourages
good practice against purchase of goods. For cases where service
providers actually need the information or invasive practices, consent
receipts serve as a method for them to demonstrate the user has indeed
agreed to their stated terms and that they have a copy they can later
inspect or use to change their mind. For such important changes to
occur, consent receipts require some form of data literacy or user
education regarding how receipts would function and how users should use
them.</p>
<h2 id="sec:relatedwork">Related Work</h2>
<p>In this section we review related work on the broader topics of
consent, its management, and representation of related information
within the context of online digital services.</p>
<h3 id="sec:relatedwork-legal">Legal requirements</h3>
<p>The current paradigm of information to be provided for ‘informed’
consent is based on requirements arising from law for the individual to
be fully informed before giving consent. Such requirements do not
directly specify the method or interface for information provision, but
merely dictate the type of information to be provided. Current common
practices include use of a privacy notice at the time of requesting
consent, either as a link or a consent dialogue.</p>
<p>In the case of GDPR, the information to be specified regarding
consent comes primarily from Article 13 for data directly collected from
an individual, and Article 14 for data collected from other sources.
This information includes identity of the service provider, the personal
data to be collected and the purpose(s) of its processing, and the
recipients of the data is shared with. This information is important for
the accountability of the organisation and vital in investigations of
legal compliance <span class="citation"
data-cites="matte_cookie_2020 santos_are_2020"><a
href="#ref-santos_are_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a>, <a
href="#ref-matte_cookie_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span>. It
should be noted that the current practice is for services to freely, and
at will, update the privacy notice, which complicates an investigation.
Only by trusting the service records (the very ones in doubt and under
investigation) can one know which privacy notice applied for a
particular user at a particular moment in time. Receipts simplify this
problem by explicitly requiring a link to the specific version of notice
applicable at the time of consent interaction <span class="citation"
data-cites="jesus_towards_2020"><a href="#ref-jesus_towards_2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[17]</a></span>.</p>
<p>In addition, laws also dictate the validity of the consenting
process, with the onus of demonstration being on the service provider
(GDPR Art. 7-1). Consent records, being intrinsically linked to legal
requirements (though not constrained by it), must therefore
‘<em>capture</em>’ and represent information about both notice and
process.</p>
<p>While this paper focuses particularly on the consent practices on
websites, the argument and application of consent receipts is readily
extensible to other avenues, such as IoT devices and smartphone apps.
The only difference is between the UI/UX paradigms, such as those
utilised within smartphones and apps as compared to websites, and the
options available for consent receipts being limited given the amount of
control permitted by the device and its OS makers (in particular Apple
for iOS and Google for Android). Regardless, such practices are now
under close scrutiny from authorities <span class="citation"
data-cites="techcrunch_iab_dataleak_2019"><a
href="#ref-techcrunch_iab_dataleak_2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[25]</a></span> including potential large fines<a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. Receipts, therefore, are not
specific to a particular medium or a technology, but represent a record
primarily from and for the human who is consenting in these
situations.</p>
<h3 id="sec:relatedwork-representations">Machine-readable
representations</h3>
<p>Receipts should be in a machine-readable form so to permit digital
tools and agents (such as a web browser) to utilise and operate over it.
There have been several approaches to represent information regarding
consent as machine-readable metadata through semantic vocabularies and
ontologies, along with visualisation techniques. We here summarise the
key related work. See Kurteva et al <span class="citation"
data-cites="kurteva_consent_2021"><a href="#ref-kurteva_consent_2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[26]</a></span> for an in-depth survey on the use
of semantics to represent various aspects and processes related to
consent and consent management.</p>
<p>The EU funded SPECIAL H2020 project<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
developed ontologies to represent consent as a ‘policy’ <span
class="citation"
data-cites="bonattiMachineUnderstandablePolicies2020"><a
href="#ref-bonattiMachineUnderstandablePolicies2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[27]</a></span> consisting of personal data,
purpose, processing, recipients, and storage durations, to be stored on
a distributed ledger for transparency and accountability. Information is
wrapped in a semantic reasoner for facilitate compliance checking. Other
projects and approaches that also define a similar semantic model of
consent include MIREL<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> project’s PrOnto ontology providing

role="doc-biblioref">[31]</a></span>. While their models suffice the
requirement for a service provider to check its own consent ‘validity’
in an operational sense, the fields they represent is not sufficient to
represent necessary information and context as required for the creation
of a consent receipt.</p>
<p>Efforts modelling additional information associated with consent
include GConsent<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <span class="citation"
data-cites="pandit_gconsent_2019"><a href="#ref-pandit_gconsent_2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[32]</a></span> semantic ontology which (also)
bases its model on GDPR compliance. It is similar to the above efforts
while additionally modelling attributes such as the method and medium of
consent, as well as its ‘state’ indicating a ‘lifecycle’ of consent - as
an artefact which starts when it is requested and ends when it is
withdrawn or otherwise terminated.</p>
<p>The Data Privacy Vocabulary<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> (DPV) <span
class="citation" data-cites="pandit_creating_2019"><a
href="#ref-pandit_creating_2019" role="doc-biblioref">[33]</a></span> is
the outcome the W3C Data Privacy Vocabulary and Controls Community
Group<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> (DPVCG) and represents a broad
consensus amongst experts from the domains of data protection, privacy,
legal compliance, and semantic web. DPV provides a semantic vocabulary
consisting of hierarchical top-down taxonomies for specifying purposes,
processing categories, personal data categories, technical and
organisational measures. For consent, it presents concepts representing
notice, expiry, provision, withdrawal, and whether the consent is
explicit.</p>
<p>It is clear that the representation of consent as machine-readable
information, especially through use of semantics, has seen both interest
and progress. However, for the receipt to be used as we envision, data
must use an interoperable format, necessarily needing a standard (e.g.
RDF or JSON) and standardised vocabularies - such as from W3C DPVCG. In
this, the challenge is to create vocabularies which are sufficient to
represent the necessary information within different jurisdictions,
while also providing a way to expand and specialise them for use-cases
and specific domains as necessary.</p>
<h3 id="sec:relatedwork-receipts">Use of Consent Receipts</h3>
<p>Consent Receipts as a conceptual framework where information
regarding consent is documented and packaged already exist as identified
in the following instances from the last 5 years. A report by Digital
Catapult <span class="citation" data-cites="nati_personal_2018"><a
href="#ref-nati_personal_2018" role="doc-biblioref">[34]</a></span>, in
collaboration with the UK’s Research and Innovation program, outlines
the use of ‘personal data receipts’ for capturing information and
increasing transparency and user trust. Several Consent Management
Platforms (CMP), such as ConsentEye<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> and Signatu<a
href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>, which act as the technology
providers (i.e. Data Processors) for service providers to assist with
requesting and managing consent through the use of dialogues and
interfaces, also support the use of consent receipts in their
frameworks. Additionally, a patent by OneTrust LLC regarding consent
receipt management systems is of tangential relevance here <span
class="citation" data-cites="barday_consent_nodate"><a
href="#ref-barday_consent_nodate"
role="doc-biblioref">[35]</a></span>.</p>
<p>While the above instances utilise receipts, they do so in an ad-hoc
fashion where the receipts contain schemas defined by the company
generating them without any recourse for proof and verification. For
receipts to be verifiable and interoperable, the information requires
cryptographic assurances to be provided by the parties that can be used
to prove consent and elicit non-repudiation along with fair-exchange
protocols to demonstrate a cryptographic receipt of acceptance <span
class="citation" data-cites="jesus_towards_2020"><a
href="#ref-jesus_towards_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[17]</a></span>. In
addition, receipts held only by the service provider are of marginal
value. For receipts to be truly functional, there has to be parity in
how they are used by the user proactively without relying on the service
provider, which necessitates users to have access to their own copy of a
receipt.</p>
<h3 id="sec:relatedwork-standards">Standards for Consent</h3>
<p>The consent receipt is an ‘<em>end-of-process</em>’ artefact as it is
generated after some process or information regarding ‘consent’ has
already taken place or is disseminated. Given that ‘consent’ has seen
several standardisation efforts at various levels in the past and is the
topic of ongoing efforts to produce agreement, this section summarises
the most pertinent ones along with their implications on the design and
utilisation of consent receipts.</p>
<p>The current specification for Consent Receipt by Kantara Initiative
<span class="citation" data-cites="lizar_consent_2017"><a
href="#ref-lizar_consent_2017" role="doc-biblioref">[36]</a></span>
offers an introduction to the concept, and is only a starting point
towards an usable and practical receipt structure. The information
fields specified by this iteration of the specification lack the
necessary information required by recent changes in consenting
mechanisms, such as the inclusion of GDPR requirements, or the necessity
of ensuring receipts are verifiable.</p>
<p>To address these concerns, two new Working Groups<a href="#fn17"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>
are underway. One is the Advanced Notice &amp; Consent Receipt Working
Group<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> (ANCR-WG); another is the CRWeb
Project (Consent Receipts for the Web)<a href="#fn19"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>
which is a directed effort to bring Receipts to dynamic web scenarios
and able to cope with a range of requirements from static websites to
dynamic browser signalling for privacy preferences (discussed in Section
<a href="#sec:relatedwork-signals" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:relatedwork-signals">3.5</a>).</p>
<p>Perhaps the most impacting specification is the Interactive
Advertising Bureau’s (IAB) Transparency Control Framework (TCF) which is
behind the vast majority of "cookie banner", the latest being version
2<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>. TCF is a pseudo-standard or a
soft-standard, given that it is a specification developed by IAB without
any formal standardisation process and implemented under agreement by
advertising industry companies and utilised in consent implementations
by CMPs. It provides a structure for representing consent information
for pre-defined data categories, recipients, and purposes. We use this
framework, with software extensions to their APIs, in one of our
use-cases (see Section.<a href="#sec:usecases-2-cookiebanners"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:usecases-2-cookiebanners">5.2</a>). One should
remark that, at the time of writing and as previously said, the TCF
framework has been found to be in breach of the GDPR’s requirements in a
draft decision by the Belgian Data Protection Authority (see footnote.2)
- which may bring dramatic changes to consenting mechanisms in the near
future.</p>
<p>Of high relevance to this paper, the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) has produced the ISO/IEC 29184:2020<a href="#fn21"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a><span class="citation"
data-cites="ISO29184"><a href="#ref-ISO29184"
role="doc-biblioref">[37]</a></span> standard for online privacy notices
and consent, published recently in 2020. Of note is that while 29814
dictates the requirements for notices and requests for consent in terms
of information provision, methods, and processes therein, it also
specifically mentions machine-readable records of consent and cites the
Consent Receipt<span class="citation" data-cites="lizar_consent_2017"><a
href="#ref-lizar_consent_2017" role="doc-biblioref">[36]</a></span> as
an example of such a record. A comparison of 29184 and GDPR <span
class="citation" data-cites="pandit2021comparison"><a
href="#ref-pandit2021comparison" role="doc-biblioref">[38]</a></span>
requirements in terms of privacy notices and consent validity and
practices demonstrates that they are largely compatible in terms of
implementations. However, they differ in terms of conditions for
validity of consent (e.g. explicit consent under GDPR has stricter
requirements). This has implications on receipts generated under ISO/IEC
specifications in term of how they should be interpreted towards legal
compliance with laws such as the GDPR.</p>
<p>The finalisation and publication of 29184 in 2020 was followed by a
currently ongoing effort at standardising the technical specification
ISO/IEC 27560<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> for consent record information
structure. This is, technically. a Consent Receipt albeit in a format
(expected) to be simpler than what we here advocate given the lengthy
and consensus-based process at ISO. It is expected to provide a
standardised agreement on what information should be contained within a
record of consent and its provision as a consent receipt. Work is still
in early stages<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> but it is expected to produce a
stable document by 2023.</p>
<p>Other notable efforts at standardising consent include domain
specific activities regarding health data. The Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources (FHIR) series of standardised specifications
for exchanging electronic health records (EHR) was developed by the
Health Level Seven International (HL7) non-profit. It contain components
for expressing the consent<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> outlining the
specifics of data and its use <span class="citation"
data-cites="bialke_magic:_2018"><a href="#ref-bialke_magic:_2018"
role="doc-biblioref">[39]</a></span> within hospital, clinical,
medicinal, and other health-data specific settings. As such, it is an
interoperable record of consent within the health data or medical domain
with a high-degree of awareness amongst domain experts and has seen
successful uptake.</p>
<p>Similar to this effort, the Data Use Ontology<a href="#fn25"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>
(DUO) is a vocabulary outlining the permissions/restrictions regarding
data based on consent in the health and medical domains. It has been
approved for use as a standardised vocabulary<a href="#fn26"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>
by the Global Alliance for Genomics &amp; Health (GA4HH).</p>
<h3 id="sec:relatedwork-signals">Privacy Preference Signalling</h3>
<p>A ‘Privacy Signal’ or a ‘Privacy Preference Signal’ is a digital
signal to be interpreted as indicating a preference regarding the data
usage and sharing preferences of an user. Consent receipts may be
generated as an explicit representations and proof of the choices
conveyed through a privacy signal.</p>
<p>A recent survey paper outlines the history and salient features of
web-based privacy signals with commentary on the political and
economical challenges in achieving conformance and agreement over such
signals. It shows that the trend is towards laws explicitly codifying
requirements to respect such signals, with CCPA <span class="citation"
data-cites="CCPA"><a href="#ref-CCPA"
role="doc-biblioref">[40]</a></span> being an example of an enforceable
law explicitly suggesting use of a privacy signal; the proposed ePrivacy
regulation <span class="citation" data-cites="EU_ePR"><a
href="#ref-EU_ePR" role="doc-biblioref">[41]</a></span> by the EU also
containing clauses regarding the actionability of privacy signals.</p>
<h4 id="sec:relatedwork-signals-dnt">DNT and P3P)</h4>
<p>The "Do Not Track"<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> (DNT) is such a signal sent via
HTTP headers to indicate the user’s preference regarding tracking, and
includes mechanisms for sites to communicate whether and how they honour
a received preference and for tracking its status. DNT was largely
panned by service providers due to not being an explicit preference by
the user, with controversy over what the term ‘track’ was to be
interpreted as, and whether software, such as web browsers, should be
permitted to set it by default. As a result of these, the signal has
largely been relegated to being not supported by companies as well as
not considered actionable by law<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Other non-successful efforts involving privacy preferences and
consent include the Platform for Privacy Preferences Project<a
href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> (P3P) which specified a protocol
allowing websites to declare how they use information they collect about
web browser users and to match this with an user’s preferences as a way
of enabling users to exercise control. Developed and standardised by the
W3C over a number of years, P3P was eventually declared obsolete
following non-adoption by service providers, criticisms of it being
difficult to use and burdening users, and difficult in enforcement.
Efforts at Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to develop mechanisms
related to consent, such as RFC 5361 <a href="#fn30"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>,
were also not successful.</p>
<h4 id="sec:relatedwork-signals-gpc">GPC and ADPC</h4>
<p>More recently, the Global Privacy Control<a href="#fn31"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>
(GPC) is a similar (albeit potentially legally enforceable) signal based
on the California Consumer Protection Act’s <span class="citation"
data-cites="CCPA"><a href="#ref-CCPA"
role="doc-biblioref">[40]</a></span> (CCPA) do-not-sell obligation which
requires companies to not sell or share personal data with
third-parties. The GPC is a boolean signal, similar to DNT in
application, and has been authored and supported by several notable
service providers, including the web browser Firefox.</p>
<p>The Advanced Data Protection Signal<a href="#fn32"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>
(ADPC) is another privacy signal which specifies a mechanism by which
the expression of choices regarding consenting to specific purposes or
its withdrawal or exercising right to object can be automated using HTTP
headers.</p>
<h4 id="sec:relatedwork-signals-ios">Signals on iOS and Android</h4>
<p>Apart from web browsers, smartphone and device makers, most prominent
Apple and Google, have also expressed their intention to develop such
signals within their respective ecosystems. While Google is yet to
present its planned solution, Apple has made recent changes to its App
Store which requires apps and their developers to specify information
about data collected and its use which is then displayed in a ‘privacy
label’ on that app’s page within the App Store. Apple has also mandated
asking consent for tracking and profiling users <a href="#fn33"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>
through its ‘App Tracking Transparency’ framework which prohibits the
retrieval of device identifiers necessary to track advertising
engagement within apps and on device until the user has given their
consent.</p>
<h2 id="sec:buildingblocks">Building Blocks of Receipts for the Web</h2>
<p>One of the more promising aspects of Consent Receipts is that they
can be bootstrapped readily, in a simpler format, without requiring any
major changes to the current consenting practices. A minimal
implementation of a receipt could be as simple as generating and sending
it to the user using existing communication mechanisms such as through
apps, a browser extension or email. However, to fully realise the vision
of an accountable, transparent, and user-empowered Web, additional
developments are needed to implement the necessary processes associated
with utilisation of receipts and self-service points. These include
architectural and implementation modifications within the consent
interfaces to support receipts, semantic markup of content to annotate
it for detection and utilisation by user-agents to generate receipts,
and standardising to support interoperability between entities acting on
the receipt.</p>
<h3 id="sec:buildingblocks-structure">Structure of Receipts</h3>
<p>A key aspect is what information should be included in the receipt.
Its structure and data should stem from the following
considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>understanding what consenting is about e.g. which categories of
personal data;</p></li>
<li><p>jurisdictional laws and regulations which mandate provision of
information for ‘informed consent’ and define conditions for ‘valid
consent’; and</p></li>
<li><p>contextual information whose existence provides benefits to a
stakeholder - such as additional information on how to exercise their
rights.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, we focus on the first two categories of information
given their necessity to realise receipts. The third category requires
specific information and processes for concepts (e.g. for exercising
rights). These are dependent on the jurisdiction which provides that
right and the technological basis for exercising it. For these, we
discuss how receipts can assist in providing information about such
concepts and accessing them without requiring additional accounts or
identifying information.</p>
<p>From the above, we broadly categorise information to be included
within the consent receipt as follows.</p>
<h4 id="sec:buildingblocks-structure-identifier">Globally unique
identifier of the receipt</h4>
<p>If one wishes to make the receipt have bearer token properties,
receipts should have a global identifier that should not be tied to any
central point. Generating such identifiers locally is nowadays common
practice with high likelihood of uniqueness e.g. as universally unique
identifier<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> (UUID). Here the term
<em>global</em> can be replaced with a similar concept that refers to
the uniqueness of an identifier within a given context - such as
specific to a service, company, or even for an individual. UUID-3 and
UUID-5 both provide a way to generate namespace-based identifiers,
whereas UUID-4 The primary requirement it represents is that the receipt
should be uniquely identifiable (by all involved parties) within that
context.</p>
<p>Even though the prevalence of mechanisms such as UUID may be
sufficient to generate unique IDs, certain areas of application, such as
where sensitive information is involved or which has potential for
detrimental impacts on individuals, may require guarantees that the
identifiers generated are collision-free. Such sensitive areas may
choose to develop their own identification mechanisms.</p>
<h4 id="sec:buildingblocks-structure-data">Personal data, its
Processing, and Purposes</h4>
<p>The receipt should contain the (types or categories of) personal data
involved and the purposes it will be collected, used, stored, shared,
and otherwise processed for, including the source, duration, and
location of personal data and its relevant processing activities. Where
such personal data is considered to be of a sensitive or a special
nature, this could be reflected in the receipt so as to indicate a
higher requirement for privacy and data protection.</p>
<p>In addition, laws such as the GDPR specify provision of additional
information in the context consenting, such as when technologies include
automation or specific processes such as profiling - as part of the
informed consent process. This information must similarly be included in
the receipt. The consent receipt should not contain actual (instances
of) personal data to avoid the receipt itself becoming an avenue for
data misuse and risk, unless doing so is necessary.</p>
<h4 id="sec:buildingblocks-structure-controllers">Identity of
Responsible Entities i.e. Data Controllers</h4>
<p>Depending on jurisdictional terminology and requirements, the
entities responsible for carrying out the specified processing of
personal data are required to be identified in the receipt. This is not
always straightforward as the distinction between responsibility of a
process and carrying it out might be interpreted as being distinct <a
href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>. Ultimately though, the identity of
an entity refers to a legal entity that must be specified for
accountability purposes. Here we do not distinguish between controller,
processor, joint controller, or other such terms given that they are
entirely defined within respective jurisdictional laws, and that the
commonality of such terms is the indication of <em>prima facie</em> the
responsible entities. Typically, a ‘processor’ is not specified within
this list given its reliance on being contracted by a controller, and
that, if needed, processors can be declared under a separate category of
recipients.</p>
<h4 id="sec:buildingblocks-structure-user">Identity of the User</h4>
<p>A consent must be associated with an individual (a "natural person"
as in GDPR) – also referred to as a user within the context of a service
or as a Data Subject or PII Principal within legal/formal terms.
Therefore the receipt must embed some notion of identification (and not
quite <em>identity</em>) through which the information can be attributed
to the individual and ownership can be established. Typically, this
could be a known identifier, such as email address or specific accounts,
or an ad-hoc, unique, perhaps secure, identifier created specifically to
refer to the individual by the receipt-issuing entity, such as an
internal identifier assigned to the individual. In our vision, we see
<em>possession</em> of a receipt, if secure, as sufficient means for
proof-of-ownership of the personal data and, hence, entitled to act on
it – such as request deletion or correction.</p>
<p>While having an identifiable field could benefit authentication and
verification processes in some cases, for privacy and security reasons
it is ideal if no personal data of the data subject is part of the
receipt. This is especially important for identifiers that are shared
across other processes and which may lead to detrimental impacts to the
individual in the form of data leaks or to the controller in the form of
legal obligations and data breaches.</p>
<h4 id="sec:buildingblocks-structure-notice">Context of Notice and
Choice of Consent</h4>
<p>A receipt must capture the consent interaction which includes the
surrounding information and processes. Typically, this involves the
provision of some information in the form of a notice, which then also
acts as the request for consent (e.g. a consent dialogue on a website
using HTML/JavaScript). While the ‘consent’ information may only be
limited to the fields related to personal data, purposes, entities, and
so on, the context of <em>consenting</em> also involves the environments
within which that interaction took place and the artefacts involved
therein <span class="citation" data-cites="jesus_towards_2020"><a
href="#ref-jesus_towards_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[17]</a></span>. For
example, it is straightforward to mislead the user into accepting terms
by carefully using malicious JavaScript and hidden HTML controls.</p>
<p>Therefore, where possible and feasible, a receipt should include
information or links to the privacy notice and the methods by which
consent was requested or obtained or otherwise interacted with. This
constitutes the ‘context’ of a consent interaction, and is important
when determining the validity of consenting mechanisms and given consent
for specific requirements within a privacy law. For example, the
requirements for consent to be freely given under GDPR are inherently
tied to the context in which that consent is interacted with.</p>
<p>Similarly, the context is also important in the sense that the
current practices for how a notice is displayed and what choices it
offers is rife with dark patterns which are manipulative and invalidate
the given consent. While a receipt may not feasibly capture the entire
environment, it can retain information such as a link to the notice and
request being shown for later audits, a concept ISO/IEC 29184
reinforces.</p>
<h4 id="sec:buildingblocks-structure-jurisdiction">Jurisdiction and
Jurisdictional Information</h4>
<p>The information to be represented within a receipt is heavily
influenced by the jurisdictional laws. Therefore to ensure accurate
interpretation of a receipt, the jurisdictions applicable for that
particular interaction might need to be represented alongside this
information. Examples of such information can simply denote a region,
such as ‘EU’ or to specific laws such as ‘GDPR’.</p>
<p>The ‘<em>applicability</em>’ of jurisdictions is a complex topic
based on the identities of entities involved, their geo-locations of
operations, political concepts such as citizenship, and the scope of
authorities as dictated by their governing laws. In practice, and
particularly in dynamic web environments, it may not be possible to
authoritatively assert the applicable jurisdiction. Instead, the service
provider or controller can provide an acknowledgement of the
jurisdictional laws it adheres to, such as by stating that since the
user is within the EU they are governed by the GDPR.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, jurisdictional laws may require the
provision of additional and specific information related to the
applicability of other features such as rights or complaint procedures.
The receipt, given that it already specifies jurisdictional information,
can also additionally be used to provide such information to the user
for ease of access and to fulfil notice and information provision
obligations.</p>
<h4 id="sec:buildingblocks-structure-thirdparties">Third-Parties and
Data Recipients</h4>
<p>A major issue with the current practices surrounding consent is the
transparency and accountability related to data being shared, sold, or
transferred to third parties under the guise of consent <span
class="citation"
data-cites="kretschmer_cookie_2021 out-of-control-2021 santos_are_2020"><a
href="#ref-santos_are_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a>, <a
href="#ref-kretschmer_cookie_2021" role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a>, <a
href="#ref-out-of-control-2021" role="doc-biblioref">[42]</a></span>.
Even where a notice or dialogue specifies a list of such third parties,
this information is often too dense and unclear as to who they are and
what they do with the consented data <span class="citation"
data-cites="santos_are_2020 gray_dark_2021"><a
href="#ref-gray_dark_2021" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a>, <a
href="#ref-santos_are_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span>.</p>
<p>The receipt, being a provisioned digital record, can provide a
complete and useful list of such entities along with relevant
information such as their identities in the form of a specific legal
identity, their role within the consent interaction, their policies,
jurisdictions, contact information, and so on. Here we note that there
is an independent relationship between the third party and the user in
terms of the the consent choice or how that consent can withdrawn only
for that particular third party. Therefore it is preferable for
accountability and record-keeping purposes if each third-party also
provided its own receipt back to the user.</p>
<h4 id="sec:buildingblocks-structure-lifecycle">Lifecycle
Management</h4>
<p>Because it is expected that the relationship between the user and
service changes over time, as governed by the interactions regarding
consent (e.g. request, give or refuse, withdraw), the receipt should
indicate the current state of consent. For example, a request to
withdraw a given consent can be exercised at any moment which requires
establishing the previous context and/or a way to reference it. Receipts
can do this. In return, the new interaction regarding withdrawal or
revocation can itself lead to producing new receipts which reference
earlier receipts for provenance and linking of information. In this
sense, receipts can become the central element of a transactional
protocol that lives across time, just like TCP/IP is for a network
session.</p>
<p>Implementation of the notion of lifecycle can also permit users to
track how their consent was initiated and used, and what options and
limitations exist or apply over it. For example, a consent can have an
expiry timestamp during which it is ‘valid’, unless terminated or
revoked). This permits both service providers and users to periodically
review their permissions and manage consent processes accordingly - such
as to ‘refresh’ (often a requirement of GDPR) or ‘re-affirm’ consent
based on time or events associated with the lifecycle.</p>
<p>In addition, there may be a need to represent states which are
typically not provided or acknowledged through the use of receipts, such
as when consent is refused to be provided. In this case, the use of
states and depicting it within a lifecycle offers several advantages,
especially for users, to demonstrate that a particular interaction
resulted in the prohibition of personal data collection and usage rather
than a permission as could be assumed or claimed by the service
provider. It also assists in cases where a user is requested to or wants
to change their initial decision.</p>
<h4 id="sec:buildingblocks-structure-audit">Auditability and
Verifiability</h4>
<p>The receipts are intended to be an authoritative artefact to
establish consent and as such to be a useful and actionable
documentation of interactions. Therefore, they must be protected for
non-repudiation, auditability, and should be verifiable by design. This
points to needing use of cryptographic schemes and secure network
protocols when creating the receipts. Greatly simplified, the core of
the threat model for the use of receipts is an involved entity or party
denying ever having issued the receipt or dispute its particulars. Thus,
receipts face two challenges: (a) how to verify the receipt is
associated with the entities involved; and (b) how to ensure the receipt
is authentic and both copies (user and service) match and were the
agreed on at the time of consenting. Jesus <span class="citation"
data-cites="jesus_towards_2020"><a href="#ref-jesus_towards_2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[17]</a></span> offers an in-depth technical
discussion and technical approach on this topic.</p>
<h4 id="sec:buildingblocks-structure-ssp">Self-Service Points</h4>
<p>We argue that, for the sake of transparency, auditability and
usability, receipts should come with (what we call) <em>self-service
points</em>. This means receipts are generated with information about an
endpoint (such as a URL/URI) for accessing features or services related
to Personal Data, either relevant or additional to the receipt. All
pertinent information necessary to access and interact with it in a
self-sufficient capacity could be available using just the receipt.
Examples of information relevant to self-service points could be the
what is already present in a receipt, such as signatures, or additional
information added specifically for the purposes of utilising such
services, such as identifiers.</p>
<p>In practice, we envision such self-service points, similar to control
panels, to be simple webpages that, on uploading the receipt, the user
has access to personal data, can inspect any operations on it (including
sharing) and make requests. Furthermore, and apart from convenience,
self-service points can enable new ways to manage personal data (e.g.
through agents) and enable exercising of rights and features without the
need for additional, often sensitive, information for identity
verification, which is a barrier to their effective utilisation today

<h3 id="sec:buildingblocks-architecture">Architecture of a Web with
Receipts</h3>
<p>In order to support consent receipts, the web and internet-based
applications (e.g. mobile apps) need to support the essential mechanisms
associated with receipt generation, utilisation, and verification.
Figure <a href="#fig:arch" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:arch">1</a> illustrates a simplified architectural
overview of the different components, functionalities, and relationships
involved in utilising consent receipts on a personal device. Through
this simplification, we hope to illustrate the applicability towards the
wider web-based privacy and data protection landscape.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/049-arch.png" id="fig:arch"
alt="Architecture of a Web with Consent Receipts" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Architecture of a Web with Consent
Receipts</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The diagram shows four key entities. The first one, central to this
paper, is the user and their (personal) device. Second is the online
service (provider) that collects personal information from the user and
holds responsibility for its usage and processing. Other than these two,
the figure also shows the other two key stakeholders representing third
parties and watchdogs. The third parties, who might be each a service
provider on their own, obtain personal data from the (primary) service
provider either directly (i.e. data is shared or transmitted by the
service provider) or indirectly (i.e. enabled by service provider to
obtain data from the user). The second category of stakeholders
represents the wider community of watchdogs who have an interest in the
investigation of practices, and consist of entities typically acting as
regulators, authorities, consumer protection organisations, and
NGOs.</p>
<p>On the user side, the user-agent or application used to support
consent receipts needs two new components. First, it needs a special
storage mechanism to collect, store and manage receipts. We anticipate
that, should consent receipts become common, a single user could collect
many receipts per day based on their interactions through the web.
Therefore, for efficiency and friction-less usage, the storage mechanism
needs implementation of a supported component within the environment
which enables interactions with other entities necessitating a receipt.
Typically, this would be web browsers for websites and the smartphone’s
operating system for its applications. In our implementation (see
Section <a href="#sec:usecases" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:usecases">5</a>), we targeted a web browser through
development of an extension that collects receipts and stores them in a
searchable database.</p>
<p>The second component on the user side is a secure transactional
protocol. As discussed before, a receipt will be of little use if one
cannot trust its contents. All entities or parties need to validate and
commit to the contents in the receipt. For example, the underlying
privacy notice needs to be signed by both to represent its provision and
acknowledgement, For this a digest of their signatures could be stored
within the receipt. We point to existing external work that discusses
and demonstrates its implementation and feasibility <span
class="citation" data-cites="jesus_towards_2020 gritzalis_i_2019"><a
href="#ref-jesus_towards_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[17]</a>, <a
href="#ref-gritzalis_i_2019" role="doc-biblioref">[44]</a></span>.</p>
<p>On the service provider side, a similar component must exist in order
to run the secure protocol that can sign and verify receipts. Given that
the service provider may be dealing with a lot of receipts, this
necessitates a solution that can function potentially at scale.
Therefore, the ‘wallet’ used to store and retrieve receipts may be
functionally different for service providers from that of the users
depending on integration with existing technologies and frameworks used.
It is important to note that even where a service provider may decide to
store information in a different form from that contained within a
receipt, the intention of the receipt is to be able to act as an
verifiable claim between the service provider and the user. Therefore as
long as the service provider can produce the receipt from its stored
information, and can match and verify it against a receipt claimed by
the user, this is sufficient for the intended functioning of
receipts.</p>
<p>In terms of identities, the users should not need to present an
official identity (e.g., passport) state-accredited form of identity to
produce a receipt; the service provider, however, must provide some form
of identity, even if a SSL certificate or ownership of a domain
name.</p>
<p>Finally, as illustrated in the figure, and not necessarily a required
component but rather a feature of consent receipts, we envision that
service providers will offer a “self-service point” as discussed
previously. Using the receipts, and strictly not needing anything else,
users could independently manage their personal data to the extent to
the law (e.g., withdraw consent or request data deletion) or the extent
the service provider is capable or comfortable with.</p>
<h3 id="sec:buildingblocks-extensions">Extensions to the Web</h3>
<p>Supporting receipts involves information associated with the service
provider’s practices, which currently is provided to the user via
notices or consent dialogues. There is a glaring lack of ways for
specifying such information at two important levels: first, the HTML -
e.g. tags for indicating notice or policy; and second, the semantic
level - e.g. schema.org<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> tags to specify the contents within
a notice, consent request, or a privacy policy. The use of automated
signals, such as DNT and GPC, are sufficient, in some cases, to indicate
choice but are weak by themselves for use as evidence without some form
of ‘record’ indicating they were applied by the user, and conformed to
by the service provider.</p>
<p>While this paper and section substantially focuses on the web as in
websites, it is important to note that the approach and argument applies
equally to personal devices. Such devices, in particular smartphones,
are platforms significantly controlled by manufacturers. Restriction and
features related to data collection through use of APIs typically lack
the means to request and record consent, even more so in a
human-friendly way. Apple’s recent efforts in providing clear
privacy-oriented labels in their App Store, and the requirement for
consent, seem to be an effective push in this direction <span
class="citation" data-cites="iOS_ATT_opt-in_2021"><a
href="#ref-iOS_ATT_opt-in_2021" role="doc-biblioref">[45]</a></span>,
though it still faces the issue that there is no way to track where,
when, and for what was consent given<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In order to implement receipts, collective changes are required
across the web and app platforms, ideally by way of standards
development and their adoption. Given the widespread prevalence of
consent interactions on the web, it is rather surprising to not have any
mechanisms through which it can be made easier for end-users to interact
with or for service providers to request and manage information. In the
following paragraphs, we outline directions for implementations and
their practicality in terms of development and adoption for improving
the web ecosystem towards better information and consent practices.</p>
<h4 id="sec:buildingblocks-extensions-annotations">Declarative
information on webpages</h4>
<p>HTML is effectively a machine-readable language through which the web
browser (as an user agent) can graphically display information and means
for interaction. Aligned efforts, such as schema.org, provide the means
to embed additional contextual semantic information so as to assist
machine-agents (such as search engines) with understanding the content
on a web page and enabling smarter features such as recommendations and
summaries. This mechanism for annotating webpages can be extended (as
described in Section <a href="#sec:buildingblocks"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:buildingblocks">4</a>) to
describe information and processes associated with consent – e.g.,
privacy notices, terms &amp; conditions, or identities of service
providers. While it is a challenge to represent this information in a
jurisdiction-agnostic way, and to keep the web as open and global as
possible, the existence of ISO/IEC standards and their use of common
vocabularies as representative of global agreement on terminology
demonstrates the possibility and feasibility of such as an approach.</p>
<p>The placement of annotations within a webpage could be at a global
level, by using the HTML <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>) tags so as to
indicate its applicability to the entire website or domain, or declared
locally within a particular HTML element (e.g.
<code>&lt;section&gt;</code> to indicate separation from other matters.
Through this, a consent dialogue can contain machine-readable
annotations to accompany the human-readable text, and also enable
automation in their interactions regarding consent.</p>
<p>The machine-readable information declared in this way can be easily
parsed and interpreted by user-agents such as the browser and utilised
in mechanisms such as generating the receipt or using accessibility
features. In addition, it can also help mitigate manipulative practices
of dark patterns by generating a notice entirely at the user-side, or to
incorporate user preferences in the design. To enable such developments,
it is critical for the web to develop dedicated elements to depict and
handle ‘notice’ and ‘consent’ as first-class processes on the web.</p>
<p>Additionally, annotations provided on a webpage also permit declaring
existence and support for receipt-aligned protocols and services such as
use of ‘wallet’ and ‘self-service’ endpoints that can also utilise the
machine-readable information. This can permit further feature-rich
interactions by having user-agents assist users in finding required
information, such as where to access a privacy policy or contact the
service provider or exercise a particular right - without needing to
hunt for information in webpages.</p>
<h4 id="sec:buildingblocks-extensions-browsers">APIs and new headers
from browsers</h4>
<p>Through APIs, web browsers provide a permissions-based model for
websites to access resources such as camera, microphone, storage (e.g.
cookies), and location. The use of this abstraction enables browsers and
users to control and manage access to features at a local (i.e. specific
website) and global (i.e. all websites) levels and to later inspect and
change them through a settings or preference management interface. We
argue for creation and utilisation of similar APIs to manage notices,
consent, receipts, and other privacy related services.</p>
<p>Without a centrally defined common mechanism to generate, store, and
verify information, browser support becomes invaluable given their role
in identifying and using information declared within or by websites and
their service providers. In addition, browsers are also well placed to
identify and act in interactions taking place through HTTP signals (such
as DNT and GPC), and can follow up communications with third-parties for
privacy and receipt management in the background. Currently, we have
fairly robust methods for authenticating identities of entities on the
web through cryptographic methods (e.g. the HTTPS protocol) which can be
repurposed to the context of receipts. This can be achieved by extending
Public Key Infrastructure and SSL certificate mechanisms to assert legal
identities for transparency, accountability, and data protection
obligations.</p>
<p>Similarly, existing data storage methods and APIs through which
browsers store preferences for websites, such as whether to permit
access to location, can be extended to provide minimal functionality for
storing preferences and receipts. Through this, users and websites can
identify if the user has indicated their preference regarding consent
previously on the website. Users can also change their initial decision
while the website can decide to provide further interaction, such as a
related notice, as a follow-up to the previous context. The mechanisms
for such receipt handling mechanisms in browsers, their utilisation by
websites, and the capabilities it provides to users needs further
exploration.</p>
<h4 id="sec:buildingblocks-semantics">Semantic Vocabulary for
Interoperable Information</h4>
<p>A standard for a receipt only indicates the fields or structure
utilised to provide information. In order to enable auditability and
transparency of information, and ensure its interoperability from
service to users to third parties, some degree of semantics is
necessary. For example, where two service providers indicate their
purpose as ‘<em>Marketing</em>’, there is ambiguity and uncertainty as
to what it specifically refers to. Therefore, semantic vocabularies
which permit machine-readable extensiblity along with interoperability
are an important aspect of declaring such information which can conform
to legal requirements and be used for exchanging information through
receipts.</p>
<p>In addition to interoperability, semantic vocabularies are also
necessary to achieve extension or specialisation of a concept to a
particular context, domain, or use-case. For example, the use of
‘<em>Marketing</em>’ as a purpose may be sufficient at a broad level,
but a service provider or a user may wish to have more granular and
specific expression such as ‘<em>Advertising</em>’ or the even more
specific description of ‘<em>Advertising about New Products</em>’. When
dealing with consent and permissions, it is vastly useful to be able to
connect the three concepts of ‘<em>Marketing</em>’,
‘<em>Advertising</em>’, and ‘<em>Advertising about New Products</em>’ in
a hierarchical fashion. This would enable handling them at arbitrary
levels of granularity. Such hierarchies can assist in better
user-management of privacy preferences such as when consent is requested
for specific purposes (e.g. specific types of advertisements) and agents
can match or compare these with user preferences that are declared at a
broad level (e.g. no consent to any type of marketing). While the use of
semantics for preference management is not novel, the possibilities it
enables for interpreting what personal data processing the information
within a receipt <em>entails</em> is a particularly interesting approach
for further exploration.</p>
<p>Existing work, as described in Section <a
href="#sec:relatedwork-representations" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:relatedwork-representations">3.2</a>, has provided a
variety of semantic vocabularies and approaches for indicating
information related to consent. We suggest mechanisms such as DPV <span
class="citation" data-cites="pandit_creating_2019"><a
href="#ref-pandit_creating_2019" role="doc-biblioref">[33]</a></span>
which provide concepts based on legal requirements, are comprehensive,
and represent a community agreement to the extent it is possible.
Further work is needed to demonstrate its utilisation for (a) generating
and using receipts, and (b) declaring annotations on webpages to markup
relevant information.</p>
<h2 id="sec:usecases">Use-Case Implementations</h2>
<p>This section reports on the experience of implementing consent
receipts across three common use-cases and demonstrating their
feasibility and practicality by serving as ‘<em>proof-of-concept</em>’
for each respective implementation.</p>
<p>The first use-case concerns websites where users enter some
information via a form and indicate their preference for use of that
information, such as for marketing. In such situations, the user
interacts and expresses their choices regarding data usage and
collection through the form and information it contains, as offered
(directly) by the service provider. We show how the service provider can
support and issue receipts for this scenario through the overall
architecture consisting of: a secure protocol, embedding semantics in
the website’s HTML, collection and generation of receipts, and
management of the lifecycle of the consent.</p>
<p>The second case concerns websites where users interact with a cookie
or consent dialogue provided by a Consent Management Platform (CMP),
which in turn offers a uniform interface and information based on the
IAB’s TCF standard across websites implementing that CMP’s solutions.
Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of receipts generated from
interactions with consent/cookie dialogues by relying on the fact that
the vast majority of consent banners found on the web are provided by
CMPs and are based on the TCF v2.0 specification. For this
implementation, we used the interface provided by CMP Usercentrics’<a
href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> and created a browser extension
("addon") that utilises JavaScript injections to extend the CMP’s
consent-handling code so that whenever the user makes a choice via the
consent/cookie dialogue, a receipt is generated and stored in the
background.</p>
<p>We note that this use-case, in practice, covers the browser
signalling approaches such as "Do Not Track" since signalling is much
simpler and, technically, unidirectional. When the browser automatically
sends the signal, a receipt could be automatically generated partially
using the techniques in the first use-case.</p>
<p>In our third implementation, we address the difficulties in
interactions and expression of choices with IoT devices, such as the
smart assistant Alexa, which only provides interactions via voice
commands and does not have a visual interface (on device). To give a
simple example, the user has to put extra effort in finding and reading
the privacy notice and in a different device.</p>
<p>Our scenario consists of a user who requests Alexa to find when their
garbage bin will be collected next. For this, Alexa requires the user’s
consent<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> to collect the required information
(i.e. user’s address) and to use it to check with the waste collection
companies for their schedule by invoking a cloud-based application,
after which it confirms with the user and books an appointment for bin
collection. In the background, Alexa then generates and sends a consent
receipt to the user by email as a record of this interaction.</p>
<h3 id="sec:usecases-1-forms">Consent Interactions via Forms on
Websites</h3>
<p>The first use-case addresses the lifecycle of consent on websites
where the user provides information through a form, such as when
creating an account or accessing a service. This use-case is based on
the single moment of interaction where the user makes a choice regarding
consent, such as through clicking a checkbox. After this consenting
moment, common methods of providing options to change this choice is to
visit account preference or settings and perform similarly interactions
- conditional upon the user having an account with the service.</p>
<p>Through our implementation, we seek to enrich this scenario with the
use of consent receipts so as to provide the user with a record of their
choice and to permit taking that record (i.e. store on a medium
controlled by the user) with them after they leave the website. For
this, we envision the browser, as the user-agent, natively supporting
the consent receipt mechanisms and assisting the user in the receipt
generation and management procedures. We implemented the required
behaviour through a browser extension that handles receipt management on
behalf of the user.</p>
<h4 id="approach-and-implementation">Approach and Implementation</h4>
<p>The process of generating a receipt is shown in the signalling
diagram shown in figure <a href="#fig:signallingconsent"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:signallingconsent">2</a>
as: (i) the user visits a website; (ii) interacts and gives their
consent; and (iii) is provided with a receipt. The browser extension
checks for consent interactions (e.g. by looking for ‘<em>Agree</em>’
button clicks) and once encountered checks if the website natively
supports receipts (e.g. by looking for metadata declaring support for
using a custom protocol). In both these instances, we assumed the
identifiability of consent interactions and declarative support for
consent receipts through ad-hoc mechanisms such as click-detection and
metadata declarations as described in Section.<a
href="#sec:buildingblocks" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:buildingblocks">4</a>. However, we found that no
such mechanisms exist within the state of the art to identify or
indicate a consent interaction taking place or a way for websites to
indicate information or processes associated with consent. This reflects
a critical lack of required infrastructure within the web ecosystem,
which we have discussed in the earlier Section.<a
href="#sec:buildingblocks" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:buildingblocks">4</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/049-signalling-accept_consent.png"
id="fig:signallingconsent"
alt="Signalling diagram for generating receipts on consent given." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Signalling diagram for generating
receipts on consent given.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Upon discovering that the website supports consent receipts, and
after the user has given their consent, the extension engages with the
website’s server (representing the service provider) through a
‘<em>special protocol</em>’ based on requirements for implementing
secure receipts (for details, reader is directed to <span
class="citation" data-cites="jesus_towards_2020"><a
href="#ref-jesus_towards_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[17]</a></span>) to
retrieve the required information and securely negotiate the consent
receipt generation. In essence, the protocol assures that cryptographic
information is exchanged that allows the local generation of signed
receipts with the same factual information. This information includes
details such as the privacy policy, nature of consent, method of data
collection (HTML and JavaScript, in this case), and other pertinent
details as discussed in Section <a href="#sec:buildingblocks"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:buildingblocks">4</a>. The
receipts are thus made unforgeable and non-repudiable. After this step,
the actual receipts are generated, and for the user, stored locally by
the browser extension (as shown in Figure <a
href="#fig:extension-receipt" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:extension-receipt">3</a>).</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/049-extension-receipts.png" id="fig:extension-receipt"
alt="Browser extension generating a receipt for recording given consent" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Browser extension generating a receipt
for recording given consent</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Our implementation supports other possibilities as well. First, the
user could reject or refuse to provide consent, such as when the user
reads the linked privacy policy and decides not to accept it due to
their various data sharing concerns <span class="citation"
data-cites="obar_biggest_2020"><a href="#ref-obar_biggest_2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[15]</a></span>. On refusal to consent, a similar
sequence of actions is triggered with the only difference being that the
receipt now records that consent was not given or was refused. It is
important to note that a service provider may not actively support
receipts showing the user has refused to consent, whether due to lack of
legal motivation or deliberate choice. However, despite these setbacks,
the receipt showing refusal to consent is a powerful artefact given that
it can be used to prove the prohibition expressed by the user to process
their personal data, and thereby challenge any illegal activities
carried out by the service provider based on assumption or disregard of
consent choices. Alternative mechanisms to ensure the receipt is still a
verifiable artefact when the service provider does not participate is
the use of a trusted third-party that signs the receipt in the role of a
‘<em>witness</em>’ similar to the legal concepts of notary and claims
<span class="citation" data-cites="j_pandit_role_2021"><a

<p>We also considered scenarios associated with the user interacting
within the context of that given consent, such as withdrawing it, or
re-consenting or refreshing it. To explore such ‘<em>secondary</em>’ and
subsequent interactions, we considered the situation where conditions
associated with the given consent have changed (e.g. some additional
data is needed) and where the notice for such changes if provided when
the user revisits the same website again. We addressed this case by
requiring the website to annotate the webpage or consent elements with
timestamps indicating the last effective change necessitating an
acknowledgement or interaction from the user. The browser extension then
reads this timestamp and compares it with the information within stored
receipts to determine whether the receipt has been generated prior to
these changes, and if so, then whether the changes require notifying the
user. In cases where the user is required to make a consent interaction
again, a similar process to the first consent interaction is triggered
by the website or add-on and a new receipt, superseding the previous
one, is generated (as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:extension-reconsent"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:extension-reconsent">4</a>).</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Use of receipts on subsequent consent
requests following changes to the privacy policy</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For addressing the requirement of declaring required information as
metadata within the webpage or consent dialogues, we utilised the
existing HTML guidelines for declaring custom metadata<a href="#fn40"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> –
see Listing <a href="#fig:html-tag" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:html-tag">[fig:html-tag]</a>). In the
<code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element of the HTML, we declare
<code>&lt;meta name="pisp"&gt;</code> representing Privacy Information
Service Point. Through this, the website or webpage informs the browser
(extension) of, among other elements, the URL of the server to run the
consent protocol, locations of privacy policy and JavaScript of the
forms collecting the consent, the date of the most recent privacy
policy, and so on. All these details are added (in the form of
cryptographic digests) to the receipt. Through this we also addressed
the issue of identifying the appropriate element for consent
interactions by requiring the website to declare the element used to
submit (e.g. ‘Agree’) a consent choice and used it to register an
<code>on-click</code> event handled by the extension to execute the
receipt generation and handling protocol upon its execution.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; 
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt; 
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; 
  &lt;meta name="pisp" content="ws://0.0.0.0:3100"&gt; 
  &lt;meta name="lastPolicyUpdateDate" content="2020-12-20"&gt; 
  &lt;script src="paecg.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script&gt; 
    var paecg=new PaECG(
      ’Submit’:’Accept’,
      [’fname’,’lname’,’email’], 
      [ ’http://0.0.0.0/js/one.js’, ’http://0.0.0.0/js/two.js’ ], 
      [ ’http://0.0.0.0/policy/one.html’, ’http://0.0.0.0/policy/two.html’ ]); 
    paecg.setup(); 
  &lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The use of HTML tag can also be helpful towards declarative
transparency related to third-parties which are related to the consent
interaction but not in control of the webpage i.e. they do not own or
operate the website but receive consent from it. Here, the service
provider, through its website, can indicate such Third Parties through
the use of annotations and metadata as discussed earlier in Section <a
href="#sec:buildingblocks" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:buildingblocks">4</a>. The extension can then
utilise this information to communicate with the third-parties, identify
whether they support receipts, and request receipts from those parties
in the background. In cases the third-parties do not actively support
receipts, the user-agent can generate a receipt solely on the user-side
so as to keep a record of the interaction or forewarn the user prior to
their choice about the lack of receipt availability. Should the Web
embrace this practice, we expect the level of transparency to
dramatically increase. Even if users still do not read the entirety of
their privacy policies, the number of receipts collected and the
richness of their information will provide an incomparable degree of
awareness, traceability, and accountability.</p>
<p>In our development of the browser extension, we envisioned further
support for additional and typical user functionality such as
downloading receipts and managing it through a dashboard, using receipt
information for creating interactive visualisations for understanding
privacy and data sharing practices, searching/sorting through receipts,
and importing/exporting receipts from other devices or accounts. This
was based on our observation that the core feature of generating
receipts from a webpage and storing it through the browser (extension)
user-agent represented functionality that can be practically invisible
and unobtrusive to the user.</p>
<h4 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h4>
<p>We note that the protocol needs about 10 round-trips in terms of
communication between the user-agent and the service provider’s server.
In our case, the size of consent receipt was small (1 kilobyte), and the
process that handled the protocol and communication was executed in
parallel to user activities. In other words, this is a background
process that minimally affect usability on the main website. The total
time for finishing these activities was less than 1 second. Through
this, we found receipts to be efficiently handled in the background in a
manner that produced no disruptions to the user’s actions or
interactions in the foreground. Considering the generation of receipts
is an infrequent activity, we do not expect any usability hurdle in
their usage. For additional evaluation metrics, see <span
class="citation" data-cites="jesus_towards_2020"><a
href="#ref-jesus_towards_2020" role="doc-biblioref">[17]</a></span>.</p>
<h3 id="sec:usecases-2-cookiebanners">Consent Management Platforms</h3>
<p>The second scenario consists of consent/cookie banners typically
served by Third parties as a Consent Management Platforms (CMP). These
organisations dominantly follow the guidelines (and implementation) of
the IAB TCF v2.0 framework for consent.</p>
<p>We used a commercially available platform of a well-known CMP,
Usercentrics and extended their functionality with consent receipts. A
simple webpage was created that displayed a familiar cookie banner as
shown in Figure <a href="#fig:testcookiebanner"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:testcookiebanner">5</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/049-simple-cookie-banner.png" id="fig:testcookiebanner"
alt="Test cookie banner." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Test cookie banner.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This represents a practical and typical situation on the web, where
service providers utilise CMPs to handle consent interactions by
deploying their dialogues and banners on their websites. Given that some
CMPs already implement a form of consent receipt to record the events
associated with consent (see Section <a href="#sec:relatedwork-receipts"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:relatedwork-receipts">3.3</a>), our implementation
demonstrates further use of such mechanisms to generate the receipts on
the user-side and with cryptographic guarantees to make them actionable
artefacts.</p>
<h4 id="approach-and-implementation-1">Approach and Implementation</h4>
<p>Similar to the previous use-case, we utilised a browser extension to
handle consent and receipts with the following modifications made to the
consent management mechanisms (see Figure <a href="#fig:cookiebanners"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:cookiebanners">6</a>):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>User visits a website and is presented with a consent/cookie
dialogue provided by the CMP, which utilises the IAB TCF v2.0 framework
through a script loaded and executed locally;</p></li>
<li><p>The user accepts or declines using the options provided in the
consent dialogue. The CMP code sends the choice expressed by the user
and its related information to the CMP or service provider (as
configured by the service provider);</p></li>
<li><p>The server (CMP or service provider) sends a confirmation to the
local CMP code, and a consent receipt is generated (on server or
locally) which is then sent to the respective server(s) and user’s
browser for storage;</p></li>
<li><p>The extension on the browser detects the generated receipt and
stores it locally (see Figure <a href="#fig:cookiereceiptswallet"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:cookiereceiptswallet">7</a>). It further sends a
confirmation of reception of receipt to the server(s) for CMP and/or
service provider.</p></li>
</ol>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Browser extension to store

</figure>
<p>In these interactions, we note that we deliberately ignored the key
function of IAB’s framework which is centred on federated data sharing
through the use of its TCF specification for implementing real-time
bidding for web advertisements, which enables the collection of a vast
amount of personal information that involves several third-parties <span
class="citation"
data-cites="vealeAdtechRealTimeBidding2021 techcrunch_iab_dataleak_2019"><a
href="#ref-techcrunch_iab_dataleak_2019" role="doc-biblioref">[25]</a>,
<a href="#ref-vealeAdtechRealTimeBidding2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[47]</a></span>. Instead, we chose to focus our
work on the component that manages consent, i.e. the role of CMP as a
data processor or mediator in the process of receipt generation.</p>
<p>Similar to the experience in first use-case implementation, we found
the browser extension handles receipts in the background with no
disruption to the user. The difference in the information and
communication processes was minor in terms of time and processing
requirements, and we found an additional duration of approximately 500ms
(discounting round-trip times) was needed for the completion of receipt
generation and storage process.</p>
<h4 id="evaluation-1">Evaluation</h4>
<p>Similarly to the previous case, the impact on usability is minimal
since any existing latency will be due to the Consent Management
transactions themselves and the actual process of generating the receipt
runs in the background. We ran both client (Firefox browser) and
webserver on the same laptop (mid-range machine: core i5, 16GB RAM) so
to minimise network latency. We repeated measurements <span
class="math inline">50</span> times and calculated averages.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/049-cmp-eval.png" id="fig:cmp-eval"
alt="Integration of receipts with cookie banners." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Integration of receipts with cookie
banners.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As Figure <a href="#fig:cmp-eval" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:cmp-eval">8</a> shows, the overall process runs in
under 1 sec (average <span class="math inline">717</span>ms with a max
of <span class="math inline">1562</span>ms). Additional functions such
as storage or generation of the receipt are under <span
class="math inline">3</span>ms. To note that this process is
embedded</p>
<h3 id="sec:usecases-3-alexa">Amazon Alexa Voice-activated Home
Assistant</h3>
<p>In this last use-case for receipts, we demonstrate how they can be
used in IoT devices with user interface constraints. Specifically, we
implemented receipts for the Amazon Alexa voice-assistant. Figure <a
href="#fig:alexareceipts" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:alexareceipts">9</a> shows the overall architecture
of our implementation. The top part of the figure shows the software
development in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the bottom shows how we
extended the functionality in our own server in order to support
receipts. An application for Amazon Alexa relies on the third-party
extension mechanism called ‘Skills’. To simplify, one configures the
trigger words in a newly created Alexa skill. If the device recognises
the trigger words, it sends a request for further processing to the
configured server, typically executed in an Amazon AWS where
pre-configured custom code is hosted and run.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">User interface in Alexa.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Our test application consisted of booking garbage collection from a
City Council. As shown in Figure <a href="#fig:alexainterface"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:alexainterface">10</a>-top
(transcripts of spoken messages), the user would start the Alexa
application by saying “open” and name the application (in our case, a
City Council in England). The voice assistant accepts the request but
asks the user to first accept the Privacy Policy and personal data
sharing settings. Note that these permissions are not intended to be for
Amazon directly, but instead allow Amazon to share personal data with a
third-party.</p>
<p>The user has to use a computer to enable this setting as shown in
Figure <a href="#fig:alexainterface" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:alexainterface">10</a>-middle at least because
Alexa, it seems, will not accept authentication using voice. Once
third-party sharing has been enabled, the original voice-request can now
be completed. Figure <a href="#fig:alexainterface"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:alexainterface">10</a>-bottom shows the original
request and Alexa contacting the third-party provider. In the process,
the application supporting this skill for Alexa will generate a consent
receipt that is sent by email to the user. After this, the garbage
collection is now scheduled and the user receives a confirmation.</p>
<h2 id="sec:conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>This paper introduced, characterised and outlined the usefulness and
benefits of ‘consent receipts’ to assist users, service providers, and
authorities regarding the transparency and auditability of consent. We
argued that consent receipts have the potential to bring a different
paradigm to personal data on the Web by providing an unobtrusive and
intuitive way for recording their interactions similar to grocery
receipts. We demonstrated the feasibility and simplicity of generating
consent receipts through three use-cases covering different but widely
relevant scenarios: accepting requests on a website, consenting through
CMPs based on IAB TCF framework, and interactions with the Amazon Alexa
voice-assistant.</p>
<p>Our implementation outlines the technical practicalities involved and
shows that the onus of effort in creating and providing receipts is
mostly on the service providers and only marginally on the user. This
works not only towards reducing the burden on users for managing their
privacy interactions, but also provides a way for service providers to
document and maintain consent records for compliance.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="practicality-of-consent-receipts">Practicality of Consent
Receipts</h3>
<p>This work raises a number of questions regarding the legality,
structure, and implementation of consent receipts across platforms and
jurisdictions. We outline a few that also serve as avenues for future
work involving receipts. First, it is important to look at these from an
inter-disciplinary perspective given that requirements for managing
consent are not limited to the technical and legal communities, but also
involves usability (as HCI), security, ethics and business models.</p>
<p>For receipts to be utilised as a supporting document in the
settlement of dispute and as evidence of malpractice, it is important to
have support<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> from the authorities regarding
their legal effectiveness. The recent clarification of GPC as an
enforceable mechanism and the upcoming (and ongoing) changes to privacy
and data protection laws across both USA and EU provide opportunities
for achieving this. Other issues in this also include specifying
international data transfers, assuring the identity of the entities such
as recipients, use of receipts in exercising rights, and codifying data
collection and sharing practices.</p>
<p>Second, the implementations we demonstrated can be considered
prototypes and early iterations. Even though we found the software
components and processes intuitive and easy to run, this needs to be
confirmed through more rigorous tests that involve both scale and
functionality and are carried out in more scenarios and
devices/platforms. Many other research questions are also relevant and
encourage more attention and research from the community. Issues such as
handling non-supporting websites is an important hurdle to cross for
receipts. For this, we find the use of third-party services that manage
receipts or act as notaries/witnesses an interesting solution to pursue.
Another relevant issue is the study of assurances offered by receipts,
and how feasible these can be through time where legal requirements
change and companies are merged or bought.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="further-development-of-consent-receipts">Further Development of
Consent Receipts</h3>
<p>The future research and work regarding consent receipts is promising
given that we might see the push for CMPs and websites to utilise the
ISO/IEC 29184:2020 <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO29184"><a
href="#ref-ISO29184" role="doc-biblioref">[37]</a></span> standard for
notice and consent. ISO/IEC 29184 provides the motivation to produce a
machine-readable receipt, while the ongoing effort and involvement of
nations and authorities in developing ISO/IEC 27560 <span
class="citation" data-cites="ISO27560"><a href="#ref-ISO27560"
role="doc-biblioref">[48]</a></span> as a specification for consent
records points towards its eventual coming on the horizon.</p>
<p>Based on these, future work also consists of analysing these as well
as other existing standards and relevant research in terms of
information and processes to create a harmonised specification for the
development and implementation of consent receipts. Additionally,
receipts need to further enhanced in terms of security of information,
actors, and the identification and mitigation of threat models. This
needs to be a smooth and transparent process for ease of use by the
users, similar to the way digital certificates are utilised on the web
for secure communication, and where problematic cases are highlighted
with large warnings.</p>
<p>Consent receipts that store personal data, especially of sensitive
nature, need further work that investigates how such information should
be secured in terms of its storage and communication. For this, receipts
in their entirety, or the information within them can be obfuscated or
protected through measures that utilise anonymisation or encryption with
strong cryptographic guarantees. Doing so can permit safer sharing of
the receipt with another party, such as for verification or
demonstration purposes, or assist in publishing it to the public, for
example as proof of consent to public data usage.</p>
<p>The above exercises are necessary for the eventual adoption and
acceptance of consent receipts socially as well as within software and
for it to become a method for ensuring and demonstrating legal and
social accountability. In this, is is important to demonstrate
sufficiency regarding security guarantees it provides, as well as the
interoperability and commonality of information based on adherence to
ISO/IEC standards.</p>
<p>We remain optimistic that receipts, as a concept, will be a point of
contention and eventual adoption, regardless of laws becoming
increasingly pragmatic and pro-consumer or as an industry-wide code of
conduct.</p>

<li id="fn35" role="doc-endnote"><p>For example, in GDPR, the
’Controller’ is defined as the entity that determines the processing of
personal data, which could result in an entity that has no access to
personal data being declared as its Controller if it has sufficient
control of the means through which it is processed. Therefore, merely
mentioning which entities have access to the data may not be sufficient
to determine responsibility and accountability.<a href="#fnref35"

<li id="fn37" role="doc-endnote"><p>While the iOS Settings provides an
overview of tracking permissions given or requested by apps, and enables
the user to toggle them collectively as well as individually, we argue
that this setting is only restricted to ‘tracking’, which is not
sufficiently defined or explored in terms of legal enforceability or the
ability of the user to indicate or enforce such a consent outside of the
device<a href="#fnref37" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn39" role="doc-endnote"><p>It can be argued that this scenario
should utilise the legal basis of a contract or legitimate interest
rather than consent based on the necessity of requiring an address to
provide the garbage collection service. However, we focus on the
principle of ‘consent’ as in assenting and the generation of a consent
receipt for recording it.<a href="#fnref39" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn41" role="doc-endnote"><p>Support can be in the form of
guidelines encouraging adoption, codes of conduct requiring records of
consent, encouragement to utilise standards, and comments on validity or
usefulness of receipts through case law.<a href="#fnref41"
