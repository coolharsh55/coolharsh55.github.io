<p>Morning tantrums weren&rsquo;t new,<br/>
Atleast not for my dearest dad;<br/>
This time i wanted a new watch,<br/>
And he really didn&rsquo;t want me sad.</p>
<p>So at breakfast he got me one,<br/>
My first watch, it had a golden shine;<br/>
It felt wonderful there, on my wrist,<br/>
Except, it didn&rsquo;t show the time.</p>
<p>He was laughin heartily,<br/>
I knew he was so happy;<br/>
After all i had a new watch,<br/>
And i wasn&rsquo;t being crappy.</p>
<p>Cheerfuly he ushered me out to play,<br/>
While mom piped to be back by nine;<br/>
I had no problems with that, Except<br/>
My watch didn&rsquo;t show the time</p>
<p>We all played hide &amp; seek,<br/>
And i hid in the hollow old tree;<br/>
Everyone had their turn finished,<br/>
But no one could find me&hellip;</p>
<p>All during play, i forgot about home,<br/>
I had to be back by nine;<br/>
I could have gone earlier,<br/>
But my watch didn&rsquo;t show me the time.</p>
<p>Sheepishly i entered the front door,<br/>
Mom was waiting with stern looks;<br/>
Had she found about my homework,<br/>
That i had a few incomplete books?</p>
<p>&rdquo;Why was i so late? &rdquo;<br/>
She asked that of me;<br/>
How could i tell her,<br/>
I was hiding up a tree.</p>
<p>All this trouble due to the watch,<br/>
Was it even worth a dime?<br/>
Sure, it looked beautifull and all,<br/>
But did it show me the time?</p>
<p>Suddenly mom snapped forward<br/>
I felt upon me, a growing tangle;<br/>
But she held my hand and asked,<br/>
&rdquo;What are you doing with my bangle? &rdquo;</p>
<p>Words falied me, not a sound escaped,<br/>
But all i managed was a funny mime;<br/>
It was one of my mom&rsquo;s bangle&rsquo;s,<br/>
Not a watch that didn&rsquo;t show the time</p>
<p>Later i was cross with dad,<br/>
And on the little joke he played;<br/>
So he bought me a real watch,<br/>
And kisses on his cheeks i sprayed.</p>
