        <p>I remember the first time we talked,<br>
A short walk, I had just met you.<br>
And you encouraged me to do well,<br>
Said, "You should never slow down or give-up".<br>
And though you said many things,<br>
With that heartful smile &amp; laugh of yours,<br>
I could feel the wisdom in it,<br>
And I took it all to heart.</p>
<p>As time passed, and I saw you if only a few times,<br>
I witness you as a leader, a teacher, a colleague,<br>
But you always were a friend to one and all,<br>
In each you cared with all your heart.<br>
And I realised one day I looked up to you,<br>
To become like you, a good person loved by all.</p>
<p>It's rare to find someone who smiles, who laughs,<br>
Whom you can always rely on, and trust, and look up to.<br>
And to find them one day just... gone...<br>
It leaves a dull ache in the still sobbing heart.<br>
But your memories shall always be fond ones,<br>
For you always had your smiles, mirrored in us.</p>
<p>Oh the stories we shall tell,<br>
To each other, to anyone who will hear;<br>
"Have you heard the legend of Shay?<br>
He ran, he sang, he danced, he drank;<br>
And he lived in the land of Bray."</p>
<p>You chased your dreams, and caught them too.<br>
You smiled and laughed and lived your life.<br>
Oh how greatly we miss you!</p>
<p>You were kind, gentle, loving.<br>
You were strong, firm, caring.<br>
To many you were a friend,<br>
A bright presence in the gloomy gray.<br>
To us  you remain, Shay,<br>
As fond memories we keep in our hearts.</p>
