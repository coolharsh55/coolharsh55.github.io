        <p>This is the story of a girl<br/>
With hair soft and sweet<br/>
Whose eyes shone with a twinkle<br/>
Her laugh of pearly white teeth</p>
<p>
She was thin and fair<br/>
With spare height<br/>
Her walk was graceful<br/>
A lovely delight</p>
<p>Everything was normal for her<br/>
Until she fell in love with a boy<br/>
It was an honest addiction<br/>
Like her first childhood toy</p>
<p>Her life started on paths<br/>
That were wavy and turned<br/>
Her heart awoke with a fire<br/>
That sizzled and burned</p>
<p>At first she didn&rsquo;t understand what<br/>
And how would he make a difference<br/>
But still she was wooed by him<br/>
His boyish charms and persistence</p>
<p>Soon she stopped being his buddy<br/>
And became his bestest friend<br/>
Her love was pure and sweet<br/>
Apparently without any ends</p>
<p>They would lie awake at nights<br/>
Just to talk to each other<br/>
She would hide her life&rsquo;s love<br/>
From her father, mother and brother</p>
<p>Life always brought her closer<br/>
Into an joyful bliss<br/>
She was yearning to meet<br/>
To get a hug and an kiss</p>
<p>Soon destiny fulfilled her desire<br/>
Cause she went on a date<br/>
Already nervous, she perspired<br/>
Because she had been late</p>
<p>He had bought her<br/>
Roses the color of blood<br/>
Seeing them she smiled<br/>
Her heart beat a thud</p>
<p>He asked her if she would be his<br/>
And she just couldn&rsquo;t answer a no<br/>
She hugged him tightly and kissed<br/>
Till it was time for her to go</p>
<p>She was madly in love<br/>
More than she let him know<br/>
Awakened, her heart beat faster<br/>
And emotions began to flow</p>
<p>Back home, all her thoughts and dreams<br/>
Were cherished memoirs of them together<br/>
Early in the morning she simply concluded<br/>
They could not live without each other</p>
<p>She laid awake all night<br/>
Talking over phone<br/>
With the morning&rsquo;s first light<br/>
She was again alone</p>
<p>Thus passed the months of September-October<br/>
And she was still going strong<br/>
It was her wildest dream and an intuition<br/>
That nothing would go wrong</p>
<p>With hope in her heart she entered November<br/>
The month that was cursed black<br/>
She never knew that by the end of it<br/>
Her love and life would just slack</p>
<p>Mad in her love<br/>
She broke many more rules<br/>
She gifted him on her birthday<br/>
Something very hip and cool</p>
<p>On her birthday<br/>
She wanted him for a date<br/>
She stood o&rsquo;er cursing<br/>
Cause he was late</p>
<p>Soon she cooled down<br/>
And took him to shopping mall<br/>
Hand-in-hand she ignored<br/>
Others who were handsome &amp; tall</p>
<p>Suddenly she insisted<br/>
For being to his place<br/>
She started arguing<br/>
Who would win the race?</p>
<p>Finally he succumbed<br/>
And took her to his home<br/>
His friends greeted warmly<br/>
And left the two alone</p>
<p>Lust finally erupted in her<br/>
And she was closer than skin and fur<br/>
Everything else around her<br/>
Was quickly turning into a rapid blur</p>
<p>He was naughty<br/>
He was also nice<br/>
The day brought in their relation<br/>
A little bit of sexy spice</p>
<p>Soon it was time for her to go<br/>
Her dad was waiting<br/>
She didn&rsquo;t want him to think that<br/>
She was out mating</p>
<p>But she was really surprised<br/>
When her dad didn&rsquo;t shout at all<br/>
She knew she had escaped<br/>
From a very big fall</p>
<p>Up continued her<br/>
Torrid love affair<br/>
She didn&rsquo;t meet much<br/>
She had no secret lair</p>
<p>He took her for a movie<br/>
That was all and all blue<br/>
The people who came there<br/>
Were very very few</p>
<p>That day he gave her<br/>
His life&rsquo;s treasure, his dairy<br/>
For him, she was the loveliest<br/>
An angel, and a fairy</p>
<p>But fate decided to curse her<br/>
And shower her with thorns<br/>
Back home, her mom tortured her<br/>
With questions and scorns</p>
<p>She had read his secret book<br/>
And was up with rage<br/>
How dare he loves my daughter<br/>
Kill that boy in a animal cage</p>
<p>But still she went strong<br/>
And they kept loving each other<br/>
She hid her dear one<br/>
From her angry mother</p>
<p>Times were difficult<br/>
But still she went strong<br/>
It was her strong intuition<br/>
Nothing more would go wrong</p>
<p>Little did she know<br/>
Of what lay ahead<br/>
The games the devil<br/>
Was playing in his head</p>
<p>He was frustrated with fate<br/>
And he confused their love<br/>
She sobbed, she cried<br/>
She started to hate</p>
<p>She was in great pain<br/>
Crying half the day,<br/>
She wanted to kill,<br/>
To curse, to slay</p>
<p>But she knew deep down<br/>
What was happening<br/>
Inside her hearts arc<br/>
Her love was very deep</p>
<p>It had etched itself there<br/>
And left her a mask<br/>
She still loved him<br/>
Deeply and dearly</p>
<p>Soon the senses<br/>
In his head came back<br/>
He apologized<br/>
He had lost his track</p>
<p>She was careful<br/>
She took her time<br/>
He wanted to love her again<br/>
But she didn&rsquo;t give a dime</p>
<p>But her love overpowered her<br/>
And she forgave him<br/>
She renewed their love<br/>
And shared her dream</p>
<p>For everyone who like this story,<br/>
There&rsquo;s something she wants to tell<br/>
That nothing can separate them,<br/>
Not even the sound of the knell</p>
<p>He paid for his mistake,<br/>
All the timely dues,<br/>
&lsquo;what&rsquo;s next? &lsquo;, if you ask&hellip;<br/>
&ndash; their story continues! ! !</p>
