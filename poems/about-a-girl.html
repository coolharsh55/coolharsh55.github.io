        <section>
            <p style="text-align: center;">This is the story of a girl<br />
With hair soft and sweet<br />
Whose eyes shone with a twinkle<br />
Her laugh of pearly white teeth</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><br />
She was thin and fair<br />
With spare height<br />
Her walk was graceful<br />
A lovely delight</p>

<div>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Everything was normal for her<br />
Until she fell in love with a boy<br />
It was an honest addiction<br />
Like her first childhood toy</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Her life started on paths<br />
That were wavy and turned<br />
Her heart awoke with a fire<br />
That sizzled and burned</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">At first she didn&rsquo;t understand what<br />
And how would he make a difference<br />
But still she was wooed by him<br />
His boyish charms and persistence</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Soon she stopped being his buddy<br />
And became his bestest friend<br />
Her love was pure and sweet<br />
Apparently without any ends</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">They would lie awake at nights<br />
Just to talk to each other<br />
She would hide her life&rsquo;s love<br />
From her father, mother and brother</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Life always brought her closer<br />
Into an joyful bliss<br />
She was yearning to meet<br />
To get a hug and an kiss</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Soon destiny fulfilled her desire<br />
Cause she went on a date<br />
Already nervous, she perspired<br />
Because she had been late</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">He had bought her<br />
Roses the color of blood<br />
Seeing them she smiled<br />
Her heart beat a thud</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">He asked her if she would be his<br />
And she just couldn&rsquo;t answer a no<br />
She hugged him tightly and kissed<br />
Till it was time for her to go</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">She was madly in love<br />
More than she let him know<br />
Awakened, her heart beat faster<br />
And emotions began to flow</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Back home, all her thoughts and dreams<br />
Were cherished memoirs of them together<br />
Early in the morning she simply concluded<br />
They could not live without each other</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">She laid awake all night<br />
Talking over phone<br />
With the morning&rsquo;s first light<br />
She was again alone</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Thus passed the months of September-October<br />
And she was still going strong<br />
It was her wildest dream and an intuition<br />
That nothing would go wrong</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">With hope in her heart she entered November<br />
The month that was cursed black<br />
She never knew that by the end of it<br />
Her love and life would just slack</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Mad in her love<br />
She broke many more rules<br />
She gifted him on her birthday<br />
Something very hip and cool</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">On her birthday<br />
She wanted him for a date<br />
She stood o&rsquo;er cursing<br />
Cause he was late</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Soon she cooled down<br />
And took him to shopping mall<br />
Hand-in-hand she ignored<br />
Others who were handsome &amp; tall</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Suddenly she insisted<br />
For being to his place<br />
She started arguing<br />
Who would win the race?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Finally he succumbed<br />
And took her to his home<br />
His friends greeted warmly<br />
And left the two alone</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Lust finally erupted in her<br />
And she was closer than skin and fur<br />
Everything else around her<br />
Was quickly turning into a rapid blur</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">He was naughty<br />
He was also nice<br />
The day brought in their relation<br />
A little bit of sexy spice</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Soon it was time for her to go<br />
Her dad was waiting<br />
She didn&rsquo;t want him to think that<br />
She was out mating</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">But she was really surprised<br />
When her dad didn&rsquo;t shout at all<br />
She knew she had escaped<br />
From a very big fall</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Up continued her<br />
Torrid love affair<br />
She didn&rsquo;t meet much<br />
She had no secret lair</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">He took her for a movie<br />
That was all and all blue<br />
The people who came there<br />
Were very very few</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><br />
That day he gave her<br />
His life&rsquo;s treasure, his dairy<br />
For him, she was the loveliest<br />
An angel, and a fairy</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">But fate decided to curse her<br />
And shower her with thorns<br />
Back home, her mom tortured her<br />
With questions and scorns</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">She had read his secret book<br />
And was up with rage<br />
How dare he loves my daughter<br />
Kill that boy in a animal cage</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">But still she went strong<br />
And they kept loving each other<br />
She hid her dear one<br />
From her angry mother</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Times were difficult<br />
But still she went strong<br />
It was her strong intuition<br />
Nothing more would go wrong</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Little did she know<br />
Of what lay ahead<br />
The games the devil<br />
Was playing in his head</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">He was frustrated with fate<br />
And he confused their love<br />
She sobbed, she cried<br />
She started to hate</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">She was in great pain<br />
Crying half the day,<br />
She wanted to kill,<br />
To curse, to slay</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">But she knew deep down<br />
What was happening<br />
Inside her hearts arc<br />
Her love was very deep</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">It had etched itself there<br />
And left her a mask<br />
She still loved him<br />
Deeply and dearly</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Soon the senses<br />
In his head came back<br />
He apologized<br />
He had lost his track</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">She was careful<br />
She took her time<br />
He wanted to love her again<br />
But she didn&rsquo;t give a dime</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">But her love overpowered her<br />
And she forgave him<br />
She renewed their love<br />
And shared her dream</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">For everyone who like this story,<br />
There&rsquo;s something she wants to tell<br />
That nothing can separate them,<br />
Not even the sound of the knell</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">He paid for his mistake,<br />
All the timely dues,<br />
&lsquo;what&rsquo;s next? &lsquo;, if you ask&hellip;<br />
&ndash; their story continues! ! !</p>
