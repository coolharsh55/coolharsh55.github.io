            <p style="text-align: center;">&rdquo; Behold! I arrive with a spectacle,<br />
That is sure to shock and surprise!<br />
For I have been granted power great,<br />
If you do not believe, have a sight! &rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Said the madman in some delight,<br />
Dressed in old rags, patched and torn,<br />
That showed his body, skin and bone.<br />
&rdquo;Behold! &rdquo;, He shouted to the crowd, Alone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">And the words were pure magic,<br />
Oh, but this I can surely swear&hellip;<br />
For as soon as he uttered them,<br />
A giant crowd had gathered there!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">What spectacle this madman had? ? ?<br />
I wondered in a fascination strange,<br />
For I found myself running to him,<br />
Cutting to the crowd till closer range.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&rdquo; People&hellip; Men and Women alike&hellip;<br />
And even little children come here,<br />
I&rsquo;ll show you the never seen before&hellip;<br />
Unseen! But have no kind of fear! &rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">And so they flocked in numbers large,<br />
Like the rats to a playing Pied Piper&hellip;.<br />
How did I stuck myself in all of this? ? ?<br />
I&rsquo;m a grown up, not a child in a diaper!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">His voice broke the chain of thoughts,<br />
Shouting as he was with flaming desire.<br />
&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll show you two opposites, and together!<br />
I&rsquo;ll show you water, Water burning of Fire! &rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The crowd just kept gasping out loud,<br />
While he proceeded to prove his deed;<br />
Amidst silent whispers emerging, he said,<br />
&rdquo;Water, is the only thing I will now need&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">And so he poured the water,<br />
Into a bucket made of steel.<br />
As he held a burning matchstick,<br />
The crowd already began to reel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">It didn&rsquo;t take time,<br />
For the match to drop<br />
And the fire to erupt&hellip;<br />
Right from the buckets top!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The crowd went wild cheering,<br />
Many threw around their hats;<br />
All the time he just smiled,<br />
Like some crooked wily rat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I grew suspicious by the second,<br />
&rdquo;That&rsquo;s no magic&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;, I said&hellip;<br />
It&rsquo;s just a conman with his tricks,<br />
I tried to console myself and my dread.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&rdquo;AquaPyre! &rdquo; &rdquo;AquaPyre! &rdquo; &rdquo;AquaPyre! &rdquo;<br />
The crowd chanted roaringly&hellip;..<br />
For that&rsquo;s what he had called it,<br />
Water and Fire, together, surprisingly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">When finally the crowd grew quiet,<br />
And the madman too, went home;<br />
I set out on my own investigation,<br />
&rdquo;Light on the matter MUST be shone&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">There was no questions about the water,<br />
It was real, the same that I drank;<br />
Then what could be the secret of it,<br />
My ferocious little mind began to think&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I reached the scene of the spectacle,<br />
There was no one else around;<br />
There was just one thing, nothing else,<br />
The bucket, which i had already found.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">It looked normal,<br />
Like the one we use everyday,<br />
But something was wrong,<br />
My thoughts had begun to stray.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Something shined inside the bucket,<br />
A slimy substance, origins I am not sure;<br />
It smelled very familiar to me&hellip;<br />
Pungent! What my nose had to endure!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">It wasn&rsquo;t much,<br />
Just a slight residue;<br />
I just walked home,<br />
With this thing new.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">On my way back,<br />
I met my friendly neighbour;<br />
&rdquo;Ho! Hi! How&rsquo;dy do? &rdquo;<br />
He asked in his usual vigour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&rdquo;Just strolling by&hellip;&rdquo;, I answered,<br />
I shook his hand like a dunce,<br />
Forgetting about the slime on it,<br />
And passed onto him the substance!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&rdquo;Oh my! What&rsquo;s this? ? ? &rdquo;, he yelled,<br />
Pretty scared and surprised! ! !<br />
On calming down, he said, he knew,<br />
Just that it was slightly under priced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I saw the knowledge shining on my face,<br />
Like a full moon on a deep dark night;<br />
I asked him with surprising eagerness,<br />
Determined to win against the secret, a fight!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">He looked confused, and at me,<br />
&rdquo;It&rsquo;s just my job to know these things&rdquo;<br />
He told me, &rdquo;Cause I work at the hardware&rsquo;s;<br />
It&rsquo;s just combustion oil, worth a few shillings.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">At first, a dense fog,<br />
Obscurated my mind;<br />
But it cleared soon,<br />
When I did a full rewind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The madman dropped the match.<br />
And the water had caught fire!<br />
Now, oil is lighter than water,<br />
So it floated like a thin mire&hellip;!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">So, I went back home,<br />
And stopped being a Hound;<br />
Happy with the secret,<br />
That I myself found&hellip;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Till today, I kept quite,<br />
For the fear of being called a liar;<br />
But I chuckle to myself,<br />
Whenever someone mentions the miracle of<br />
AquaPyre! ! !</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
