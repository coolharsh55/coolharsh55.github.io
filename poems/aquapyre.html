        <p>&rdquo; Behold! I arrive with a spectacle,<br/>
That is sure to shock and surprise!<br/>
For I have been granted power great,<br/>
If you do not believe, have a sight! &rdquo;</p>
<p>Said the madman in some delight,<br/>
Dressed in old rags, patched and torn,<br/>
That showed his body, skin and bone.<br/>
&rdquo;Behold! &rdquo;, He shouted to the crowd, Alone.</p>
<p>And the words were pure magic,<br/>
Oh, but this I can surely swear&hellip;<br/>
For as soon as he uttered them,<br/>
A giant crowd had gathered there!</p>
<p>What spectacle this madman had? ? ?<br/>
I wondered in a fascination strange,<br/>
For I found myself running to him,<br/>
Cutting to the crowd till closer range.</p>
<p>&rdquo; People&hellip; Men and Women alike&hellip;<br/>
And even little children come here,<br/>
I&rsquo;ll show you the never seen before&hellip;<br/>
Unseen! But have no kind of fear! &rdquo;</p>
<p>And so they flocked in numbers large,<br/>
Like the rats to a playing Pied Piper&hellip;.<br/>
How did I stuck myself in all of this? ? ?<br/>
I&rsquo;m a grown up, not a child in a diaper!</p>
<p>His voice broke the chain of thoughts,<br/>
Shouting as he was with flaming desire.<br/>
&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll show you two opposites, and together!<br/>
I&rsquo;ll show you water, Water burning of Fire! &rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd just kept gasping out loud,<br/>
While he proceeded to prove his deed;<br/>
Amidst silent whispers emerging, he said,<br/>
&rdquo;Water, is the only thing I will now need&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so he poured the water,<br/>
Into a bucket made of steel.<br/>
As he held a burning matchstick,<br/>
The crowd already began to reel.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take time,<br/>
For the match to drop<br/>
And the fire to erupt&hellip;<br/>
Right from the buckets top!</p>
<p>The crowd went wild cheering,<br/>
Many threw around their hats;<br/>
All the time he just smiled,<br/>
Like some crooked wily rat.</p>
<p>I grew suspicious by the second,<br/>
&rdquo;That&rsquo;s no magic&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;, I said&hellip;<br/>
It&rsquo;s just a conman with his tricks,<br/>
I tried to console myself and my dread.</p>
<p>&rdquo;AquaPyre! &rdquo; &rdquo;AquaPyre! &rdquo; &rdquo;AquaPyre! &rdquo;<br/>
The crowd chanted roaringly&hellip;..<br/>
For that&rsquo;s what he had called it,<br/>
Water and Fire, together, surprisingly.</p>
<p>When finally the crowd grew quiet,<br/>
And the madman too, went home;<br/>
I set out on my own investigation,<br/>
&rdquo;Light on the matter MUST be shone&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no questions about the water,<br/>
It was real, the same that I drank;<br/>
Then what could be the secret of it,<br/>
My ferocious little mind began to think&hellip;</p>
<p>I reached the scene of the spectacle,<br/>
There was no one else around;<br/>
There was just one thing, nothing else,<br/>
The bucket, which i had already found.</p>
<p>It looked normal,<br/>
Like the one we use everyday,<br/>
But something was wrong,<br/>
My thoughts had begun to stray.</p>
<p>Something shined inside the bucket,<br/>
A slimy substance, origins I am not sure;<br/>
It smelled very familiar to me&hellip;<br/>
Pungent! What my nose had to endure!</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t much,<br/>
Just a slight residue;<br/>
I just walked home,<br/>
With this thing new.</p>
<p>On my way back,<br/>
I met my friendly neighbour;<br/>
&rdquo;Ho! Hi! How&rsquo;dy do? &rdquo;<br/>
He asked in his usual vigour.</p>
<p>&rdquo;Just strolling by&hellip;&rdquo;, I answered,<br/>
I shook his hand like a dunce,<br/>
Forgetting about the slime on it,<br/>
And passed onto him the substance!</p>
<p>&rdquo;Oh my! What&rsquo;s this? ? ? &rdquo;, he yelled,<br/>
Pretty scared and surprised! ! !<br/>
On calming down, he said, he knew,<br/>
Just that it was slightly under priced.</p>
<p>I saw the knowledge shining on my face,<br/>
Like a full moon on a deep dark night;<br/>
I asked him with surprising eagerness,<br/>
Determined to win against the secret, a fight!</p>
<p>He looked confused, and at me,<br/>
&rdquo;It&rsquo;s just my job to know these things&rdquo;<br/>
He told me, &rdquo;Cause I work at the hardware&rsquo;s;<br/>
It&rsquo;s just combustion oil, worth a few shillings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first, a dense fog,<br/>
Obscurated my mind;<br/>
But it cleared soon,<br/>
When I did a full rewind.</p>
<p>The madman dropped the match.<br/>
And the water had caught fire!<br/>
Now, oil is lighter than water,<br/>
So it floated like a thin mire&hellip;!</p>
<p>So, I went back home,<br/>
And stopped being a Hound;<br/>
Happy with the secret,<br/>
That I myself found&hellip;.</p>
<p>Till today, I kept quite,<br/>
For the fear of being called a liar;<br/>
But I chuckle to myself,<br/>
Whenever someone mentions the miracle of<br/>
AquaPyre! ! !</p>
