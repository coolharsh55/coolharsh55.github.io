        <p>I met you but didn't see, <br>
I heard you but didn't listen, <br>
I was unaware, I was free,<br>
You were you, not yet with me, Claire. </p>
<p>An accident of fate, <br>
A risk we would never take, <br>
And yet we met, somehow,<br>
I never knew I missed you, dear Claire. </p>
<p>Opening doors and walking with me,<br>
Hand in hand, full of glee,<br>
Wiping my tears, making me smile,<br>
A lovely friend in my life, you Claire.</p>
<p>And when things were bright,<br>
And the skies had sunshine,<br>
And it seemed life was alright,<br>
Was it all your doing, oh Claire?</p>
<p>Lows after the highs,<br>
Dark clouds over the skies,<br>
Tears falling down as rain,<br>
There was so much pain, it hurt, Claire.</p>
<p>Caught with you, in this maelstrom,<br>
I rode along, wind whipped,<br>
Trying to keep you warm,<br>
I hope my light wasn’t cold, Claire.</p>
<p>And then you left, for home,<br>
Packed up in tears, <br>
Left me by myself and alone,<br>
I wish I could follow you, Claire.</p>
<p>It pains me so, to stay and not follow,<br>
To not comfort you when you need it,<br>
It makes me feel empty and hollow,<br>
But I’m a victim of the cruel world, Claire.</p>
<p>I hoped in those goodbyes,<br>
That you remember me fondly.<br>
When we’re not under the same skies,<br>
You would do that, wouldn’t you Claire?</p>
<p>I wish I could look in your eyes once more,<br>
To say I love you, even though I hadn’t said it ever before.<br>
But thus we leave our lives in the hands of fate,<br>
My flower, my star, my sunshine, my Claire</p>
