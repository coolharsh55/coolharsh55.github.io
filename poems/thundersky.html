<p>one-day i was sitting indoors<br/>
cause mom told not to go out<br/>
i think i knew the reason why<br/>
the clouds outside would shout</p>
while sitting near the window<br/>
i noticed the sky to be flared<br/>
then the sudden explosion happened<br/>
that was enough to be scared</p>
i know my brother noticed this<br/>
cause he had begun to taunt<br/>
and i had nothing inside me<br/>
no bravery or courage to flaunt</p>
i was really really scared<br/>
so much so, i could not move<br/>
my brother saw this opportunity<br/>
to tell tales of the demon groove</p>
he told me of a monster<br/>
whose roar was a shrieky voice<br/>
when he decided to abduct<br/>
the poor child had no choice</p>
he told of the thousand hands<br/>
that flew from sky to ground<br/>
and when they fell on the child<br/>
nothing of him could be found</p>
i felt my stomach wrench<br/>
just from hearing his story<br/>
i told him he was bluffing<br/>
in all his stupid glory</p>
as i went to look outside and<br/>
saw the truth in what he said<br/>
there was a demon outside<br/>
and maybe he wanted me dead</p>
faster than my legs could carry me<br/>
i ran to hide in the cot&rsquo;s underside<br/>
shivering coldly from head to toe<br/>
very scared as i was from the inside</p>
nothing could have brought me out<br/>
except the scolding&rsquo;s of my mother<br/>
in an angry march with a loud voice<br/>
&lsquo;&rsquo;to finish my food would i bother? ? ? &lsquo;&rsquo;</p>
Unwillingly and with glaring eyes<br/>
I finally slid out from below<br/>
She saw I was scared to my soul<br/>
With fear i must have turned yellow</p>
Taking me in her arms, in a tight embrace<br/>
She asked me what scared me so much<br/>
And when i told her of the demon outside<br/>
She simply said there&rsquo;s nothing as such!</p>
And when i dragged her to the window<br/>
To show her the bright flashes of light<br/>
Maybe she could drive the monster away<br/>
And everything again would be allright</p>
But to my dismay, she dragged me away<br/>
Towards my room, and all my books<br/>
She was searching something in urgency<br/>
Looking in all the corners, all the nooks</p>
Finally satisfied with her efforts<br/>
She gave me a book weighing a ton<br/>
She asked me to search for the demon<br/>
Said she wouldn&rsquo;t go till I was done</p>
So i searched and searched<br/>
All the while the book in my hands<br/>
It was the giant encyclopedia<br/>
Abnout the seven seas and the lands</p>
Irritated, she grabbed the book<br/>
Just so to turn a thousand pages<br/>
And shoved it back towards me<br/>
as I expected an article on mages</p>
But it was about the clouds<br/>
The sky and even the rain<br/>
And the demon was right there<br/>
Oh! how terrible a pain!</p>
She tried hard not to laugh<br/>
As i showed her the picture<br/>
Egging me to just read ahead<br/>
She went to make some mixture</p>
As i looked, slight glances at first<br/>
I also read the words alongside it<br/>
There was something written big<br/>
So coolI copied it down on a paper bit</p>
I went running to my brother<br/>
For he surely woudn&rsquo;t lie<br/>
He glanced at it just once,<br/>
And said &ndash; &lsquo;&rsquo;THUNDERSKY&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
