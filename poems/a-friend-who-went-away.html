        <p>I had a great new friend,<br />
Who knew me right away&hellip;..<br />
It seemed really funny to me,<br />
How she understood all i had to say.</p>
<p>I remember the time not long ago,<br />
When we laughed and fought,<br />
We were the best of friends,<br />
Or atleast that&rsquo;s what i thought.</p>
<p>I often wonder why happiness end&rsquo;s,<br />
What happens to break that tie;<br />
How can someone so close<br />
Just wave you off with a goodbye?</p>
<p>I know, i must have been lacking<br />
I know, i must have been wrong<br />
Maybe i wasn&rsquo;t the friend to you<br />
That you were to me all along.</p>
<p>The days thus pass<br />
At nights i yearn,<br />
From all that has happened<br />
I wish i could learn.<br />
That life is never what you desire<br />
It leaves you tasting flames of fire</p>
<p>Everyone is away, those who meant the world to me.<br />
All i have left of them are these memories&hellip;<br />
And i shall love them as i always have,<br />
Love them, and love their memories&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s becoming difficult for me, to hide behind this frown,<br />
When from the inside, i am on the verge of a breakdown.<br />
I try not to worry, since they&rsquo;re left in the past,<br />
But its hard, knowing in life, nothing will ever last.</p>
<p>You see your day, and see it through,<br />
Knowing what i&rsquo;m writing is all so true.<br />
Yet you ignore the meaning of all this<br />
Maybe thinking i am being childish,<br />
I&rsquo;ve tried to ignore, i&rsquo;ve tried to forget<br />
But all i see is the moments we&rsquo;ve met</p>
<p>Do you know what it feels like to be left behind?<br />
Losing everyone around you in so little time?<br />
I think you know, you had once felt the pain&hellip;<br />
Still, you want my joy to be washed away in the rain.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t ever forget the moments we&rsquo;ve had<br />
The day you left me, i felt so sad&hellip;<br />
A friend who went away, is a very sad thing,<br />
The angels weep instead of sing&hellip;&hellip;</p>
