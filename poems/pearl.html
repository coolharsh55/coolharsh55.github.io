<p>As i ate food, in the night<br/>
Mouth watering at the sight<br/>
Of the new exotic apple red<br/>
Pizza&rsquo;s and the garlic bread.</p>
<p>I wondered whether it was my whim<br/>
Or had the lights really flickered dim,<br/>
Did i smell a smell so enchanting<br/>
That it made my heart go dancing?</p>
<p>No sooner had i thought of this<br/>
That everything went around in bliss<br/>
I just caught the first sight of her<br/>
Heard her talk. But just a murmur</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long i sat staring<br/>
On my part it was some daring<br/>
At last she smiled at my despair<br/>
I almost fell out of my chair</p>
<p>She threw at me slight glances<br/>
That just had increased my chances<br/>
Maybe if i didn&rsquo;t do something stupid<br/>
We could be struck by love cupid</p>
<p>And so i decided to go and talk<br/>
Look my best with a manly walk<br/>
The sight of her made my toes curl<br/>
But she simply said her name was Pearl</p>
<p>I too smiled and said Hello<br/>
But saw that her teeth were yellow<br/>
It&rsquo;s okay i said to my mind<br/>
Maybe she is of different kind</p>
<p>I engaged her in some small talk<br/>
She suggested we do a short walk<br/>
So we walked and talked about titbits<br/>
To my dismay she knew nothing about it</p>
<p>I talked about food, wine and rum<br/>
But all the while she just stayed mum<br/>
I tried clothes, movies and even fashion<br/>
Maybe i was just another distraction</p>
<p>So i tried to talk about some books<br/>
Or how men could be good cooks<br/>
But she held her lips tight<br/>
All she could do was fight</p>
<p>I was tired of talking and of her<br/>
If we dated, what happened after<br/>
Maybe she was just another beauty without a brain<br/>
And so another one had gone down the drain</p>
