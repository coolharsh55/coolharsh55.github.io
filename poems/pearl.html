            <p style="text-align:center">As i ate food, in the night<br />
Mouth watering at the sight<br />
Of the new exotic apple red<br />
Pizza&rsquo;s and the garlic bread.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">I wondered whether it was my whim<br />
Or had the lights really flickered dim,<br />
Did i smell a smell so enchanting<br />
That it made my heart go dancing?</p>

<p style="text-align:center">No sooner had i thought of this<br />
That everything went around in bliss<br />
I just caught the first sight of her<br />
Heard her talk. But just a murmur</p>

<p style="text-align:center">I don&rsquo;t know how long i sat staring<br />
On my part it was some daring<br />
At last she smiled at my despair<br />
I almost fell out of my chair</p>

<p style="text-align:center">She threw at me slight glances<br />
That just had increased my chances<br />
Maybe if i didn&rsquo;t do something stupid<br />
We could be struck by love cupid</p>

<p style="text-align:center">And so i decided to go and talk<br />
Look my best with a manly walk<br />
The sight of her made my toes curl<br />
But she simply said her name was Pearl</p>

<p style="text-align:center">I too smiled and said Hello<br />
But saw that her teeth were yellow<br />
It&rsquo;s okay i said to my mind<br />
Maybe she is of different kind</p>

<p style="text-align:center">I engaged her in some small talk<br />
She suggested we do a short walk<br />
So we walked and talked about titbits<br />
To my dismay she knew nothing about it</p>

<p style="text-align:center">I talked about food, wine and rum<br />
But all the while she just stayed mum<br />
I tried clothes, movies and even fashion<br />
Maybe i was just another distraction</p>

<p style="text-align:center">So i tried to talk about some books<br />
Or how men could be good cooks<br />
But she held her lips tight<br />
All she could do was fight</p>

<p style="text-align:center">I was tired of talking and of her<br />
If we dated, what happened after<br />
Maybe she was just another beauty without a brain<br />
And so another one had gone down the drain</p>

<p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;</p>
