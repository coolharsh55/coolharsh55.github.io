<p>I was in the garden of eden,</p><p>With the love of my life, a maiden.</p><p>Oh, how happy I was to see her,</p><p>To embrace her, hug her, kiss her!</p><p><br></p><p>We sat down under a blossoming tree,</p><p>Careless in love, our spirits soared free;</p><p>The forbidden fruit hung over our heads,</p><p>Oh, what naive creatures were we!</p><p><br></p><p>Like a serpent slithering unawares,</p><p>The fallen fruit rolled over to our feet;</p><p>Ignorant we ate it without any cares,</p><p>And our souls were filled with conceit.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw the heavens part above me,</p><p>The sky opened up in a flare;</p><p>All the other creatures remained carefree,</p><p>Except us, for we became aware.</p><p><br></p><p>I uncovered the hidden truth,</p><p>Sins I had committed in my life;</p><p>Judge me, for I am a sinner,</p><p>For I had coveted another man's wife.</p><p><br></p><p>And yet, I desperately held on,</p><p>The last vestiges of my dream;</p><p>I chose eternal fire thereupon,</p><p>To hold on to the sins of my love.</p><p><br></p><p>Like the proverbial Adam and Eve,</p><p>I was cursed to forever grieve,</p><p>To always dream the lie of a fresh start,</p><p>Oh, how I despise and hate my heart!</p>
