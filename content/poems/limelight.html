description: the limelight of a (new) life

===
<p>Staggering first steps into a new world,</p>
<p>The feet small, with toes that curled;</p>
<p>Like puffed cotton, soft to the touch,</p>
<p>Cheeks that flushed as roses much;</p>
<p>Encouraging glances, within eyesight;</p>
<p>The centre of a vivid life in limelight.</p>
