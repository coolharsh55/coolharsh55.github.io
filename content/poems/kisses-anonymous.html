<p style="text-align: center;">I came home, half asleep, and still confused;<br />
Walked in with my shoes, manners excused.<br />
My eyelids meeting, glued shut at last;<br />
I went in to a haze, blurs coming in fast.<br />
Morning came in too early and too bright;<br />
Daggers piercing my body that were light.<br />
My body grew in a dull filling ache;<br />
Head throbbing, I dared not shake.<br />
The memories were amnesia, the symptoms synonymous;<br />
I had lipstick marks on my right cheek, a kiss anonymous.</p>
