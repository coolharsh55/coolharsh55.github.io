<h3 style="text-align: center;">part I</h3>

<p style="text-align: center;">I dont know what to do&hellip;<br />
options here so very few<br />
getting bored like hell on fire&hellip;<br />
nohing here satisfies my desire<br />
tired of sitting online the entire day&hellip;<br />
hoping that someone&rsquo;ll be there to say<br />
but nothing happens all day long<br />
at night i sleep<br />
singing the same old song</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">part II</h3>

<p style="text-align: center;">i now sit and meditate,<br />
no longer i quiver or hesitate;<br />
i reflect on the events of today,<br />
what good or bad i did in dismay;<br />
the routine gives me a peaceful serenity,<br />
it takes me close to wisdom and divinity;<br />
knowledge of living is abundant like the cod,<br />
this is just a little step towards realising what is god&hellip;</p>
