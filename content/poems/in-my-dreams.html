===
<p>Lost in the line,</p><p>Between dreams and reality...</p><p>Outside all of time,</p><p>Unchained, and free.</p><p><br></p><p>The memory of open eyes,</p><p>Unaware of truth and lies;</p><p>When I am my soul,</p><p>Complete, unadulterated, whole.</p><p><br></p><p>Reality becomes the sacrificial lamb,</p><p>Fantasies of every kind;</p><p>Just another tourist I am,</p><p>In the the consciousness of my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me be in peace in my dreams,</p><p>Where the world has no boundaries and no seams;</p><p>Of consciousness, God, and morality I do not care,</p><p>The world is a better place to live there.</p>
