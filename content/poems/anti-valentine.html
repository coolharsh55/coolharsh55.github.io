<p style="text-align:center">The sky is bright,<br />
The earth is pink;<br />
It may look pretty,<br />
But it does stink.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">People scrambling around,<br />
A large crowd of posers;<br />
Acting to please others,<br />
What a bunch of losers!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">We watch from across the table,<br />
This abhorrent display of vanity;<br />
We find solace in each other,<br />
Lost in this crowd we reek of sanity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Drawn together, not by attraction,<br />
But repulsion of the things around;<br />
People whispering to each other,<br />
Like white lies is their sweet sound.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">As we look each other in the eye,<br />
You smile gaily at me without a lie;<br />
I shuffle closer to prop on one knee,<br />
To ask you this in all my sincerity;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">For I&rsquo;m not yours, and you&rsquo;re not mine,<br />
My darling, will you be my Anti-Valentine?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;</p>
