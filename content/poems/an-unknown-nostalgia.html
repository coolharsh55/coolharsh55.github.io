<p><br></p>Eyes closed, I turn my face out to the wind,<div></div><div>The waves rock my feet, out in the open sea.</div><div>The land to my back, the horizon to the front,</div>Moving on, why does my heart not feel free?<div></div><br>To move forward, my heart flutters like a lamb,<br><div>What is holding me back, chains that I cannot see?</div><div>Even when I’ve gone away and come so far ahead,</div><div>Why do I feel I have been left behind, an absentee?</div><div><br></div><div>The clouds rush over my head</div><div>They flutter and wave to me</div><div>I know not what they try to say</div>To come with them, they plea<div><br></div><div>Why does my heart feel empty instead of full?</div>Does it not want me to go on this adventure?<div>Why can’t I enjoy the view when it is so beautiful?</div>Does the sadness ruin it, makes it obscure?<div><br></div>Possessions, treasure, money, and wealth<br><div>All I have brought with me, safe by my side.</div><div>And I have good food, and excellent health.</div><div>What do I fear losing then? I cannot decide.</div><div><br></div><div>The entire journey I yearned, but found little peace, </div><div>I had trouble sleeping, and some sleepless nights.</div><div>I walked in the night air, amidst the calm open sea,</div><div>Though I tried, the calmness would not get in me.</div><div><br></div><div>When I reached the port, I saw some flying geese,</div><div>How they kept together, in celebrations and in fights.</div><div>I saw the people who had come to receive dear ones,</div>I saw their eyes shine in joy with blessed little lights.<div><br></div><div>How I wished to see those lights shine for me,</div><div>To be the one who draws in such company!</div><div>To talk with such joy, as to make my heart free.</div><div>To ask where they’re going, and accompany.<br><div></div><div><br></div><div>This reminded me of companions back home.</div><div>Friends, yes, that was the answer to this mystery.</div><div>I could not turn and go back, but write a tome.</div><div>On how much I loved and missed them, a history.</div></div><div><br></div><div>I said thus to the passing songbirds,</div><div>“Keep me in your hearts if you will,</div><div>For I will cetainly come back one day.</div>I love you and us, together and apart.<div>Let us be this way, come what may"<br><div></div></div>
