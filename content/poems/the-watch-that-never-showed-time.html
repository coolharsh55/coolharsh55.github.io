<p style="text-align: center;">Morning tantrums weren&rsquo;t new,<br />
Atleast not for my dearest dad;<br />
This time i wanted a new watch,<br />
And he really didn&rsquo;t want me sad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">So at breakfast he got me one,<br />
My first watch, it had a golden shine;<br />
It felt wonderful there, on my wrist,<br />
Except, it didn&rsquo;t show the time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">He was laughin heartily,<br />
I knew he was so happy;<br />
After all i had a new watch,<br />
And i wasn&rsquo;t being crappy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Cheerfuly he ushered me out to play,<br />
While mom piped to be back by nine;<br />
I had no problems with that, Except<br />
My watch didn&rsquo;t show the time</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">We all played hide &amp; seek,<br />
And i hid in the hollow old tree;<br />
Everyone had their turn finished,<br />
But no one could find me&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">All during play, i forgot about home,<br />
I had to be back by nine;<br />
I could have gone earlier,<br />
But my watch didn&rsquo;t show me the time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Sheepishly i entered the front door,<br />
Mom was waiting with stern looks;<br />
Had she found about my homework,<br />
That i had a few incomplete books?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&rdquo;Why was i so late? &rdquo;<br />
She asked that of me;<br />
How could i tell her,<br />
I was hiding up a tree.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">All this trouble due to the watch,<br />
Was it even worth a dime?<br />
Sure, it looked beautifull and all,<br />
But did it show me the time?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Suddenly mom snapped forward<br />
I felt upon me, a growing tangle;<br />
But she held my hand and asked,<br />
&rdquo;What are you doing with my bangle? &rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Words falied me, not a sound escaped,<br />
But all i managed was a funny mime;<br />
It was one of my mom&rsquo;s bangle&rsquo;s,<br />
Not a watch that didn&rsquo;t show the time</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Later i was cross with dad,<br />
And on the little joke he played;<br />
So he bought me a real watch,<br />
And kisses on his cheeks i sprayed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
