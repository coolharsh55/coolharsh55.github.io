<p style="text-align: center;">Various dreams and nightmares<br />
I&rsquo;ve had throughout my life<br />
But nothing haunts me more<br />
Than the girl at midnight</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">A face so beautifull<br />
Shining in the moonlight<br />
Take a step towards her<br />
And she vanishes from sight</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Whether I&rsquo;m at home<br />
By the window, or the door<br />
She never fails to appear<br />
I wish I could see her more&hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">So many passions I&rsquo;ve had<br />
Of love, lust and some fright,<br />
But nothing ignites me such<br />
As the Girl at midnight&hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">To see her through the fog,<br />
Glowing like the full moon,<br />
I run along after her&hellip;<br />
Hoping to catch her soon</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Only to step on a boulder<br />
To fall down with a cry,<br />
To see her smile at me<br />
An expression so wry&hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I ask her for help<br />
But she runs far&hellip;<br />
Leaving me, the boulder<br />
and an horrible scar&hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The next time I see her<br />
Oh! It&rsquo;s been so late.<br />
What cruel things do<br />
When you believe in fate!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I cry out after her<br />
Beg her for her name<br />
I want to end this thing<br />
Or I would go insane&hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">She inches closer, towards me<br />
Or am I dreaming???<br />
The brush of her lips over mine;<br />
And my heart was reaming&hellip;.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">By the time I opened my eyes<br />
She had been long gone<br />
I could do nothing now<br />
Execpt write this song&hellip;</p>
