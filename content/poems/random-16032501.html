description: was thinking what would I think if in addiction

===
<p>Blurs; colors mixing and spreading all around me,</p>
<p>Swirls; birds without wings just trying to be free;</p>
<p>An identity lost in the silence of chaos,</p>
<p>Souls coming together in a seance.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This hunger that comes from within,</p>
<p>I feel it from every pore of my skin;</p>
<p>When the mind is lost and out of control,</p>
<p>The body fragile as crumbling charcoal;</p>
<p>This divine feeling of a leap and flying high,</p>
<p>The end of life as I wave off a good bye.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Alas, reality kicks in much too soon,</p>
<p>The harshness bursts my balloon;</p>
<p>Another escape is what I so desperately need,</p>
<p>Healing feels much better when I bleed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I feel the noise drive me mad,</p>
<p>I feel the soul rot and go bad;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve waited for eons now with time,</p>
<p>I can hear the ringing of the chime;</p>
<p>I need the substance that makes me feel divine,</p>
<p>It is my temple, It is my shrine.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Come, free me from this prison of pain,</p>
<p>Liberate me from my own brain;</p>
<p>The world is not worth one breath,</p>
<p>Come, help me unto my death.</p>
