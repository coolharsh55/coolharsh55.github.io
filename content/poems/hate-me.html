<p style="text-align: center;">hate me, i am not worthy of love,<br />
neither am i peaceloving dove;<br />
hate me, i am not worthy of trust,<br />
betrayal for me is a compulsory must;<br />
hate me, i am not worthy of being a friend,<br />
i am not one of the few who waits till the end;<br />
hate me, cause i cannot be loved or made a friend,<br />
make me your enemy, use me, or call me a fiend&hellip;</p>
