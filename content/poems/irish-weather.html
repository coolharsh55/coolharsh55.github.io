<blockquote>
<div>I was standing by the balcony, looking at the shower drenching the pavement in front of my home. The sun was shining brightly, and I was searching for signs of a rainbow. Suddenly, the rain turned into flakes of snow and the road became littered with patches of white. I stared in amazement in the change of weather. From a warm sunny outlook, to light rain, and then sudden snow.</div>

<p style="text-align: center;">Two minutes of sunshine,<br />
Five minutes of rain,<br />
Suddenly it starts snowing,<br />
This weather is insane!!!</p>
