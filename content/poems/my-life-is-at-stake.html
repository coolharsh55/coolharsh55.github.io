===
<p style="text-align: center;">fooled by destiny i made a mistake,<br />
i regret, my life is at stake.<br />
i knew not how much i stood to loose,<br />
i thought it would be easy, just to choose.<br />
now whenever i think of you,<br />
my eyes fill with tears.<br />
i&rsquo;m afraid of the day i loose you,<br />
that drowns me in fear.<br />
you know, i think, i still love you<br />
i remember everything<br />
together we&rsquo;ve spent these moments few<br />
my dreams are only about you<br />
my nightmares are about losing you<br />
we were almost like husband and wife,<br />
why did everything go wrong in life?<br />
i know it was my fault<br />
i wish to be struck by a lightning bolt<br />
i wish to get things back in order<br />
i&rsquo;m trying to think broader<br />
i have always loved and still love thee,<br />
my dear, will you forgive me?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">{please dont say no now,<br />
i cant bear that<br />
i stand to loose everything<br />
dont increase that<br />
i know i have made a mistake<br />
i regret, my life is at stake}</p>
