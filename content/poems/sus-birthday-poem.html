<p style="text-align: center;">It all began with a phone call<br />
When she called my friend<br />
Fawaz Nassar &ndash; the tall</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I changed my voice before talking to her<br />
But it was quite some time<br />
To see i wasn&rsquo;t the one she was after</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">A funny and surprised yell<br />
Who was i? ? ?<br />
She asked me to tell</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I said to her about me<br />
I was her friend&rsquo;s friend<br />
I didn&rsquo;t dream she would be my dee</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">A nonchalant question to state<br />
Would you be my brother?<br />
To answer i did not hesitate</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Of course, i could be<br />
If she wasn&rsquo;t serious<br />
She woudn&rsquo;t remain my dee</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">But two days you sent me it<br />
The rakhi that i tied to my heart<br />
The smile on my face that was lit</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Soon after that were flowing<br />
With the paper of emotions<br />
The happy wind in my face blowing</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Life coudn&rsquo;t be better<br />
Everyday stop our postman<br />
Hey, where&rsquo;s my letter?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Then came the book<br />
Beautifull as they were<br />
Letters in every nook</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Of course we coudn&rsquo;t write again<br />
Its great though that we started<br />
To leave it midway was a pain</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The first time we met<br />
In your college, as visitors<br />
The smile on your face was great</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The motions of your hand over mine<br />
The rakhi that you tied on my wrist<br />
The realation that felt divine</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The subsequent talks and meetings<br />
Those impromtu moments of time<br />
Like joy in life with a greeting</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Another gem in my life added<br />
A rare one at that<br />
Its now become friend-studded</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I credit you, fully for other flowers<br />
I dont know what to say<br />
She keeps me smiling for hours</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Oh, i promise to be there for you<br />
And i mean what i say<br />
Friends do these things few</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I also say that i care<br />
It probably means more<br />
I trust you to share</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Stupid poems cant be continued forever<br />
Even infinity has a limit<br />
Your dear brother &ndash; for ever</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
