<div>
<p>The dark night feels warm,<br />
In the comforts of my bed.<br />
Today has gone by in a swarm,<br />
Yet I think of dawn in my head.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Like whispering a few words,<br />
In the heart of dying embers.<br />
I think not of chirping birds,<br />
But a busy ants&#39; chambers.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">The marching of the feet,<br />
To the beating of drums.<br />
Counting the things to do,<br />
When tomorrow comes.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">The night has robbed me,<br />
I can no longer sleep.<br />
My thoughts now run free,<br />
Rivers that cut deep.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><br />
The melancholy sound that comes,<br />
Too late I realize it&#39;s my heart.<br />
I was too busy beating the drums,<br />
To see my dreams torn apart.</p>
</div>
