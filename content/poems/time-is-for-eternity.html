<p style="text-align: center;">time is for eternity<br />
but it does not wait for me<br />
i have fooled with it<br />
it makes me pay the fee<br />
i lay dead, in hope and despair<br />
that life may do wonders<br />
and make some repairs<br />
but i know its useless,<br />
that my hardships shall be fruitless<br />
theres no use of me toiling<br />
of banging my head and bloodboiling<br />
because time is for eternity<br />
but it does not wait for me&hellip;</p>
