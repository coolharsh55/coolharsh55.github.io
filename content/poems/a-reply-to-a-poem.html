<p style="text-align: center;">No one ever warned me<br />
About the hazards i face from you<br />
You could kill me with laughter<br />
And i woudnt have a clue!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Nothing could have prepared me<br />
For the sweetness that was you<br />
A person who could come so close<br />
Within the past weeks few</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">With you there&rsquo;s only happiness<br />
So much, that its maddening me<br />
There&rsquo;s sadness only when you<br />
Feel sad, and then i follow thee</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Yet, we have so many fights, and<br />
I dont understand how you bear me<br />
How you still manage to smile<br />
Still find something good to see</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">U love friendships, and u point it out<br />
Of some nicest people i have ever seen<br />
And yet u dont realise, your my friend too<br />
Just to have u, how lucky i&rsquo;ve been</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">To say i&rsquo;ll be there for you is no joke<br />
To lend a shoulder a true feat<br />
To have true friends is wonderfull<br />
Theres nothing friendship cannot beat</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">As i always have said, and still say to thee,<br />
You are an amazing person, you are, Gauri<br />
Dont change yourself, and remember me<br />
Laugh, smile a lot and always be free</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
