===
<p style="text-align: center;">alone i wait on this road, a road called life,<br />
i missed my chance to strike, when the time was rife.<br />
alone i travel on these dusty paths,<br />
dreaming all things i havent done;<br />
like playing football and doing maths,<br />
eating pizzas and exotic bunsl<br />
alone i walk in the realms of life,<br />
so long since i had a companion;<br />
oh god, bless me and send a friend,<br />
that we may have a joyfull reunion..</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">{but he is cruel and wont pay any heed<br />
for he had asked me to be a lotus,<br />
and i had grown like a weed&hellip;}</p>
