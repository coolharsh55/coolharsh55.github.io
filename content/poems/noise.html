description: too many things happening around us
headerimage: 
===
<p>This world, spinning on and on,
<br>Turbulent, violent, from dusk to dawn;
<br>The bubbling chaos of speech,
<br>Yet no one to hear me talk;
<br>Everyone wants to preach,
<br>But no one takes a walk;
<br>
<br>The slim silhouette in the glass,
<br>The fluttering of a butterfly;
<br>Promises of an imaginary class,
<br>Captured in the blink of an eye;
<br>Where my thoughts are not my own,
<br>Where every pauper aspires the throne;
<br>
<br>A feeling of silent strangling sweeps over,
<br>Nothing to see, no more grass, no clover;
<br>Buried in a white sea of light,
<br>Necks that are turned too tight;
<br>To see the degradations of the soul,
<br>Into slaves are turned bodies whole;
<br>
<br>Tell me,
<br>Who am I? What do I do?
<br>And why if you tell me I&rsquo;m happy,
<br>Do I not feel so too?
<br>
<br>Warmth enshrined in a thorn,
<br>Prick my hand, and then I mourn;
<br>This culture of imaginary money,
<br>Stale bread and stolen honey;
<br>
<br>Wars fought in the name of peace,
<br>Bombs explode, rationalities cease;
<br>The mind is numb from the shock,
<br>Tick-tock, tick-tock goes the clock;
<br>
<br>Captured in a world within a world,
<br>Like a nightmare within a dream;
<br>Where every action is judged by a social lever,
<br>Amongst all this noise, has love been lost forever?</p>
