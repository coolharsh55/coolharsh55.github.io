        <p>These are the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai">Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI</a> published by the European Commision. I found these guidelines to be very abstract, and thought of an exercise where we find other applicable terms that still work when we replace 'AI' with them.</p>
        <p><button id="replace" onclick="replaceTerm();">replace AI with</button>: <input id="term"></input> <a href="#content" onclick="replaceTerm('AI');">revert</a> <br/>

	        <p>Trustworthy <span class="term-AI">AI</span> should respect all applicable laws and regulations, as well as a series of requirements; specific assessment lists aim to help verify the application of each of the key requirements:</p>
	        <ul id="guidelines">
	            <li>Human agency and oversight: <span class="term-AI">AI</span> systems should enable equitable societies by supporting human agency and fundamental rights, and not decrease, limit or misguide human autonomy.</li>
	            <li>Robustness and safety: Trustworthy <span class="term-AI">AI</span> requires algorithms to be secure, reliable and robust enough to deal with errors or inconsistencies during all life cycle phases of <span class="term-AI">AI</span> systems.</li>
	            <li>Privacy and data governance: Citizens should have full control over their own data, while data concerning them will not be used to harm or discriminate against them.</li>
	            <li>Transparency: The traceability of <span class="term-AI">AI</span> systems should be ensured.</li>
	            <li>Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness: <span class="term-AI">AI</span> systems should consider the whole range of human abilities, skills and requirements, and ensure accessibility.</li>
	            <li>Societal and environmental well-being: <span class="term-AI">AI</span> systems should be used to enhance positive social change and enhance sustainability and ecological responsibility.</li>
	            <li>Accountability: Mechanisms should be put in place to ensure responsibility and accountability for <span class="term-AI">AI</span> systems and their outcomes.</li>
	        </ul>
