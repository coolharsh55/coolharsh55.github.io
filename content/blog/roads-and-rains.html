<p lang="en-US" style="text-align: center;"><em>The sky is cloudy and dark, its that time of the year again,</em></p>

<p lang="en-US" style="text-align: center;"><em>when patches of grey mysteriously disappear under rain.</em></p>

<p lang="en-US" style="text-align: center;"><em>And the people in cars bump, thump, fall over each other,</em></p>

<p lang="en-US" style="text-align: center;"><em>All the while splashing mud, but not moving much farther&hellip;</em></p>

<p lang="en-US" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="text-align: justify;">Yeah, I get it, it&rsquo;s monsoon time. And the roads are either full of shit or they are shit. Well, I guess the&nbsp;government&rsquo;s moon plan&nbsp;went for a toss, and we are back to being clueless about what&rsquo;s happening. So I decided to see for myself&nbsp;&nbsp;whether there was anything new this time around&hellip;</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="text-align: justify;">Well, for once, I decided to walk on foot, that being the obvious choice because of my deterrence towards not being stuck in mud or traffic. This way I could also cross roads easily. So I got outside, with an umbrella, an overall raincoat, and knee-high gumboots. Figured this will save me from any water related mishap (be it torrential rains, or torrential mud-splashing drivers). I open my umbrella, and start walking towards what I remember to be the direction to the market road. The very first foot I set outside the footpath results in me going 2feet deep inside some kind of pool-like structure.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="text-align: justify;">I somehow get outside it, to find myself standing in the middle of the road. Screaming horns from all sides alert me to their oncoming (dangerous) approach. Well, I have no idea why I&rsquo;m being screeched upon, and it is mighty difficult to walk with knee-high gumboots filled with water. So I try to snail my way out of the road. Meanwhile, a rickshaw pulls up near me (brave fellow, I think I might get a lift to the other side of the road). To my puzzled face, he carefully chose a few tasty words, which made my face beet-red. Asking (or not?) what I was doing in the middle of the road, and how was everyone supposed to move along. I looked towards the road, expecting to show him how&nbsp;&nbsp;there is a lane system on the road, when I suddenly I felt like being in the middle of a river(maybe a stream). So I just saved myself a few faces(I have many of them!) and hopped onto the rickshaw. He looked at me as if I were an enemy soldier who had hopped into his tank, asking for a lift&hellip;</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="text-align: justify;">So after analyzing his carefully maintained glare (I think for about 2min), I told him I wanted to go to the market. As soon as I jump in, he whizzes off like a rocket taking off. Before I could stabilize myself from the sudden shock in the forward direction, I feel another one pushing me towards the right. It was as if someone shot us that way. And then there was another one towards left. Again right, again left. I felt like being inside a rollercoaster made out of aluminum. Right, left, right, left, right, right, left, left&hellip; I looked up to see in glimpses the rickshaw making maneuvers like it was&hellip; strafing! THE RICKSHAW WAS STRAFING!!! After what seemed like an entire episode of well played quake, the rickshaw came to a halt, and so did my bouncing heart&hellip;</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="text-align: justify;">Well, so he did drop me off just before market, explaining painfully to me how the bridge to market was out-of-order for vehicles, and that I may cross it on foot as it would be easier than going all the other way. Frankly I think he just hit his strafe-limit. So I started off on foot towards what looked remotely like a partially submerged bridge to me&hellip;</p>
