description: Found a website that already does something similar to HDD-indexer
headerimage: 
===
<p>I found out about imdbnator.com - it's a nifty little website that reads
a folder containing movie files, parses them, and presents a neat index
of movie metadata from IMDb. That's exactly what HDD-indexer aims to do.
Or does. Whatever.</p>
<p>The point is, it's great that such a tool exists out there, doesn't
require any form of installation, and serves up a pretty list of movies
on disk. It even involves movie posters! As of now, HDD-indexer has only
the basic movie metadata such as title, release date, and a few ratings.
I do plan to eventually add more fields to it, but I think those are
secondary compared to finishing all the modules first. </p>
<p>Being aware of imdbnator.com has given me new aims and goals as to what
I want to do with HDD-indexer. I emailed the developer, looking to
collaborate or get some sort of help, but that didn't happen. The
developer (great guy) informed me that he has no plans to open source
his project any time soon. Upon persisting, he did give me a few tips,
tricks, and things to think about.</p>
<p>Levenshtein distance - using this to get the most appropriate movie
title based on filename. I had planned on using this anyhow. The idea
came to me when I was looking at the output of the metadata_by_title
functions that try to identify a movie based on its filename. It gave
various options for titles, and some of them were way off the mark. I
thought about using string similarity to get the closest match possible,
and assign that as the identified movie. This search led me to the
Levenshtein algorithm, which is the best candidate. It is fast, it is
simple, and can be used directly on the database (SQL queries) if need
be.</p>
<p>Offline database - here's where the tricky part comes in. As per the
suggestion, having an offline copy of the database allows much faster
search and resolutions. Sounds great, I know it works, and is a great
model for static servers. But HDD-indexer is a portable utility that
moves with the disk. So I need all that amount of data in a portable
database that can be easily loaded into the program. SQLite struggles
with huge amounts of data. So I'm in a pickle here as to how to go about
it. </p>
<p>I only need the database for READ access, since I'm not going to change
any information on it. All the writes and changes are going to be in
another database, which will be the user's database. This read-only
approach makes most sense because SQLite has a global write lock, which
means it locks the entire database when writing. Not good for
performance. Having a separate database with read-only access would
allow concurrent multiple threads to access it without any problems.
Only the primary keys referring to rows in this IMDb database could be
saved in memory, and then later written to the user database in a single
thread. </p>
<p>Integrating the database into Django seems to be possible. It supports
multiple databases which are separate and can adhere to different
models. It also supports a (great) tool called inspectdb, that creates
models based on existing database schemas. So theoretically, I can
construct the IMDb database, use inspectdb to create models for it, and
use these in HDD-indexer. The only thing that is uncertain over here is
the kind of performance it would return. </p>
<p>Integrating such an offline flow is great, because Internet over here
still seems like a luxury rather than a commodity. How well this
approach integrates with the online-metadata approach is something that
I should be able to understand well as I develop this later on. For now,
I'm more focused on the v0.3 release, which would introduce the Exporter
and Organizer modules. I'm particularly excited about the Organizer,
because it could (in theory) organize your entire movie collection like
iTunes does with the help of metadata. For starters, there will be basic
organization capabilities like release year and alphabetically. Later
on, I plan to organize using complex conditions such as genre, series,
and directors.</p>
