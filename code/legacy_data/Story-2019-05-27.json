Opening up a body was not going to be easy. I made an incision just below the neck and continued around from the chest right down to the hip. The blade was sharp and cut sharply. Blood dripped out, but there was no spraying. The skin was cold to touch. The eyes locked upwards in a lifeless stare. There were still traces of mud clinging around the arms and the hair. But it didn't matter. Mud did not get inside the body. Which had begun decomposing, the signs were clearly visible. A nameless person buried in a random grave with no tombstone. Perfect for my little hobby. I checked to make sure no one was around. The lights had to be off for that reason. But no one usually turned up anyway. And even if they did, it would not be surprising to have a body on the table. A quick cover-up was easy, there were sheets lying around everywhere. Working in a morgue had its advantages. </p>\n<p>The last time someone had come poking around, it was the night guard. He was surprised to see me holding a torch and dressed in full attire. I was an amateur back then. I forgot to pay attention to my surroundings. Luckily, I said that the lights shorted out and I was searching for equipment to make sure it was not damaged before I worked on getting the power back. He believed me, that idiotic fool. Nevertheless, he left me alone. I continued my 'research', and of course, I learnt to be cautious.  </p>\n<p>I still remember the first time, it had happened by quite an accident. A drunkard had dropped a body at the door asking for some quick cash. Said he found it by the roadside. I was halfway through dialling the police, but then I didn't. I paid him instead, and hid the body in one of the compartments. No one wants to go poking through the dead bodies in a morgue. I could have kidnapped someone and kept them there and no one would have found out as long as they were quite and still. The corpse he had brought in was fresh, a little warm to the touch. Dead only a few hours. My hands had trembled as I put a blade to its throat. The first few cuts were shabby, but they became steady and precise as I went along. I had an epiphany that night. I became aware of my life's purpose. </p>\n<p>Ever since that night, whenever I had the chance, I had walked along the graves. Unmarked graves were often at the end, in corners, so no one bothered me. It was easy to choose bodies from the signs of a fresh grave. Kids, teenagers, boys, girls, men, women, grandmas... I didn't care. Everyone was just a subject, the bodies part of a learning experiment. As the  body count increased, I became bolder. I cut through the heart, the brains, the sex organs. They were truly naked in front of me. I had reduced them from human to a lifeless mass of blood and bones. I ached to do more, I needed more. </p>\n<p>One night on a full moon, I found Bobby, freshly buried, the mud had not clung to the body yet. Bobby was a tramp who lived around corners in a our neighbourhood. People mostly tolerated him because he would do odd jobs for small money. I had talked to him a few times, and he knew me. The presence of a person I knew lying there under my knife excited me. As I carved out his heart, I knew working on nameless corpses was not going to be satisfying anymore. I needed people, alive. I needed prey. </p>\n<p>As was the case where I lived, it proved impossibly difficult to procure a live body. It would have been too much of a risk. A mere suspicion would have been enough to stop my experiments. It frustrated me to great lengths and I spent many a sleepless nights wondering. I began having dreams of me cutting people alive. At first they screamed and thrashed around and I still cut them, the work was terrible. Such perfect bodies just being wasted from all that movement. But then as I grew accustomed to these dreams, the people grew calm and still. Now as I cut them they did not move at all. Their eyes were filled with horror as they followed the movements of my hand. And even when I cut them and removed their heart, they still did not scream. I woke up drenched in sweat and high on ecstasy watching the life drain from those eyes every night. </p>\n<p>Pretty soon these dreams turned into reality. The people I usually performed autopsies on would take on the roles of these victims. At first, I had to imagine hard, force myself to conjure them into all sorts of regular people, such as a school teacher maybe. But then they started having a life on their own. It did not matter what they had been. Just their horror filled eyes that stared as I cut them past the flesh and through the bone. It was exhilarating. </p>\n<p>The scalpel in my hand slipped over the gushing blood. A mistake like this happens sometimes. I was too busy looking over the dead brown eyes staring intently deep and directly in to my own. But just as sudden as it could, I felt the hairs on my neck stand up, and a chill ran down my spine. Momentarily distracted, I thought I saw the eyes on that body move for real. I moved back, unsure whether I was dreaming, and glanced at my hand that held the quivering scalpel. The blood smeared on the tip of the gloves felt real. It clinged to my hands as I wiped the sweat off my brow with a mop. As I reached the table I felt it happen again. Those cold and dead eyes, following me as I walked around. Then it slowly raised its head.  </p>\n<p>I felt terror emanating from my guts. My legs started shaking as I moved backwards, very slowly, an inch at a time. The body moved. Its eyes looked into my own, shining as if they were alive. It felt surreal, the way it looked at me. No living person could have that look. Nothing human could ever have that look. I felt myself drenched in sweat. The body was now sitting up trying to move its one leg as the other dangled from the edge of the table, cut into half, limp. It grinned at me, the gums whiter than the teeth, sending me into a paralysing shock. My heart thumped and banged against my chest. The body put its leg on the floor and lurched forward with a scream from its throat. Blood sprayed from what should have been a mouth. With no tongue, the sounds emanating from it were pure terror. It fell on the floor, not able to stand on one leg alone. I backed up along the wall as it started its crawl towards me. </p>\n<p>I threw the first thing that came to my hand, my scalpel, and it stuck the body in the eye. Its head first turned left and then right. Then it looked straight at me again, grinning with blood and pus oozing from the open wound, the scalpel still sticking out in the air. It crawled frantically, intestines dragging along the floor, the top of the brain open and shining in the dim light. I screamed. It lunged at me and grabbed my throat. </p>\n<p>I thrust the scalpel deeper into its head. That did nothing except spray more pus onto my face. I was blinded. I wiped my eyes to see its teeth near my throat. I pushed away hard, and I felt the lungs in my hand as they squeezed their fluids. I grabbed the scalpel and thrust it into its heart. Repeatedly. It did nothing. I could hear the screams come closer to my ear now. I could feel the teeth bite the skin of my neck. An artery pulsed under it, and I felt hot blood gush out. </p>\n<p>The door opened and some policemen came in. I could not hear what they said, I did not want to hear what they said. They looked calmly while the lifeless body lay on me biting my throat. One of them flipped the lights on and asked something about a murder yesterday. I screamed at them to get the body off me, but they merely looked puzzled. I screamed and showed them my hands full of blood. They stood there staring as if I had repeated a bad joke, saying \"Tell me doctor, did you by chance finish that autopsy from the day before?\" </p>\n<p>How could they pretend to not know! I could take it no more. I threw up my hands and dropped the scalpel to the floor. I tore out the gloves and picked up pieces of the heart with my bare hands. I screamed at them, \"I confess! I confess to everything! Here....\" and I opened the containers along the walls. Full of bodies I had dug up from the graves. They all had the same eyes, and they all sat up as if possessed, and they all came after me. I moaned in terror. I backed up as far as I could and they still would not stop. The policemen did not do anything. They still looked at me like I was the only odd thing in that room. I had to escape. I could not run outside. No matter where I went, the bodies would not let me live. I had to confess. I had to confront that which I had awakened. My darkest nightmares. </p>\n<p>\"I confess!!! I confess to everything. This here with the intestines dragging along the floor is Bobby the tramp who died the other day. That lady with half her brain missing is the school teacher who died last week. This here is little Johnny, the kid everyone prayed for as he died from cancer. Look at them! Look how dead they are! Look how they come to kill me! Oh I can take it no more!\" </p>\n<p>I had the scalpel in my hand. I knew one cannot kill that which is already dead. I had to make this stop. I had to stop this terror. I had to get away from their undead moans and the otherworldly screams. I took the scalpel to my throat and slashed it as far as I could. As blood gushed out, I felt calmness and numbness spread through me. \"Take that, you sonsofbitches...\", I screamed at them. They merely laughed, and didn't care at all. Those crazy eyes kept looking at me until my very last breath. But at least I could have peace finally. Or could I?</p>", "body": "I had a scalpel in one hand, torchlight in the other.

And even if they did, it would not be surprising to have a body on the table. A quick cover-up was easy, there were sheets lying around everywhere. Working in a morgue had its advantages. \r\n \r\nThe last time someone had come poking around, it was the night guard. He was surprised to see me holding a torch and dressed in full attire. I was an amateur back then. I forgot to pay attention to my surroundings. Luckily, I said that the lights shorted out and I was searching for equipment to make sure it was not damaged before I worked on getting the power back. He believed me, that idiotic fool. Nevertheless, he left me alone. I continued my 'research', and of course, I learnt to be cautious.  \r\n \r\nI still remember the first time, it had happened by quite an accident. A drunkard had dropped a body at the door asking for some quick cash. Said he found it by the roadside. I was halfway through dialling the police, but then I didn't. I paid him instead, and hid the body in one of the compartments. No one wants to go poking through the dead bodies in a morgue. I could have kidnapped someone and kept them there and no one would have found out as long as they were quite and still. The corpse he had brought in was fresh, a little warm to the touch. Dead only a few hours. My hands had trembled as I put a blade to its throat. The first few cuts were shabby, but they became steady and precise as I went along. I had an epiphany that night. I became aware of my life's purpose. \r\n \r\nEver since that night, whenever I had the chance, I had walked along the graves. Unmarked graves were often at the end, in corners, so no one bothered me. It was easy to choose bodies from the signs of a fresh grave. Kids, teenagers, boys, girls, men, women, grandmas... I didn't care. Everyone was just a subject, the bodies part of a learning experiment. As the  body count increased, I became bolder. I cut through the heart, the brains, the sex organs. They were truly naked in front of me. I had reduced them from human to a lifeless mass of blood and bones. I ached to do more, I needed more. \r\n \r\nOne night on a full moon, I found Bobby, freshly buried, the mud had not clung to the body yet. Bobby was a tramp who lived around corners in a our neighbourhood. People mostly tolerated him because he would do odd jobs for small money. I had talked to him a few times, and he knew me. The presence of a person I knew lying there under my knife excited me. As I carved out his heart, I knew working on nameless corpses was not going to be satisfying anymore. I needed people, alive. I needed prey. \r\n \r\nAs was the case where I lived, it proved impossibly difficult to procure a live body. It would have been too much of a risk. A mere suspicion would have been enough to stop my experiments. It frustrated me to great lengths and I spent many a sleepless nights wondering. I began having dreams of me cutting people alive. At first they screamed and thrashed around and I still cut them, the work was terrible. Such perfect bodies just being wasted from all that movement. But then as I grew accustomed to these dreams, the people grew calm and still. Now as I cut them they did not move at all. Their eyes were filled with horror as they followed the movements of my hand. And even when I cut them and removed their heart, they still did not scream. I woke up drenched in sweat and high on ecstasy watching the life drain from those eyes every night. \r\n \r\nPretty soon these dreams turned into reality. The people I usually performed autopsies on would take on the roles of these victims. At first, I had to imagine hard, force myself to conjure them into all sorts of regular people, such as a school teacher maybe. But then they started having a life on their own. It did not matter what they had been. Just their horror filled eyes that stared as I cut them past the flesh and through the bone. It was exhilarating. \r\n \r\nThe scalpel in my hand slipped over the gushing blood. A mistake like this happens sometimes. I was too busy looking over the dead brown eyes staring intently deep and directly in to my own. But just as sudden as it could, I felt the hairs on my neck stand up, and a chill ran down my spine. Momentarily distracted, I thought I saw the eyes on that body move for real. I moved back, unsure whether I was dreaming, and glanced at my hand that held the quivering scalpel. The blood smeared on the tip of the gloves felt real. It clinged to my hands as I wiped the sweat off my brow with a mop. As I reached the table I felt it happen again. Those cold and dead eyes, following me as I walked around. Then it slowly raised its head.  \r\n \r\nI felt terror emanating from my guts. My legs started shaking as I moved backwards, very slowly, an inch at a time. The body moved. Its eyes looked into my own, shining as if they were alive. It felt surreal, the way it looked at me. No living person could have that look. Nothing human could ever have that look. I felt myself drenched in sweat. The body was now sitting up trying to move its one leg as the other dangled from the edge of the table, cut into half, limp. It grinned at me, the gums whiter than the teeth, sending me into a paralysing shock. My heart thumped and banged against my chest. The body put its leg on the floor and lurched forward with a scream from its throat. Blood sprayed from what should have been a mouth. With no tongue, the sounds emanating from it were pure terror. It fell on the floor, not able to stand on one leg alone. I backed up along the wall as it started its crawl towards me. \r\n \r\nI threw the first thing that came to my hand, my scalpel, and it stuck the body in the eye. Its head first turned left and then right. Then it looked straight at me again, grinning with blood and pus oozing from the open wound, the scalpel still sticking out in the air. It crawled frantically, intestines dragging along the floor, the top of the brain open and shining in the dim light. I screamed. It lunged at me and grabbed my throat. \r\n \r\nI thrust the scalpel deeper into its head. That did nothing except spray more pus onto my face. I was blinded. I wiped my eyes to see its teeth near my throat. I pushed away hard, and I felt the lungs in my hand as they squeezed their fluids. I grabbed the scalpel and thrust it into its heart. Repeatedly. It did nothing. I could hear the screams come closer to my ear now. I could feel the teeth bite the skin of my neck. An artery pulsed under it, and I felt hot blood gush out. \r\n \r\nThe door opened and some policemen came in. I could not hear what they said, I did not want to hear what they said. They looked calmly while the lifeless body lay on me biting my throat. One of them flipped the lights on and asked something about a murder yesterday. I screamed at them to get the body off me, but they merely looked puzzled. I screamed and showed them my hands full of blood. They stood there staring as if I had repeated a bad joke, saying \"Tell me doctor, did you by chance finish that autopsy from the day before?\" \r\n \r\nHow could they pretend to not know! I could take it no more. I threw up my hands and dropped the scalpel to the floor. I tore out the gloves and picked up pieces of the heart with my bare hands. I screamed at them, \"I confess! I confess to everything! Here....\" and I opened the containers along the walls. Full of bodies I had dug up from the graves. They all had the same eyes, and they all sat up as if possessed, and they all came after me. I moaned in terror. I backed up as far as I could and they still would not stop. The policemen did not do anything. They still looked at me like I was the only odd thing in that room. I had to escape. I could not run outside. No matter where I went, the bodies would not let me live. I had to confess. I had to confront that which I had awakened. My darkest nightmares. \r\n \r\n\"I confess!!! I confess to everything. This here with the intestines dragging along the floor is Bobby the tramp who died the other day. That lady with half her brain missing is the school teacher who died last week. This here is little Johnny, the kid everyone prayed for as he died from cancer. Look at them! Look how dead they are! Look how they come to kill me! Oh I can take it no more!\" \r\n \r\nI had the scalpel in my hand. I knew one cannot kill that which is already dead. I had to make this stop. I had to stop this terror. I had to get away from their undead moans and the otherworldly screams. I took the scalpel to my throat and slashed it as far as I could. As blood gushed out, I felt calmness and numbness spread through me. \"Take that, you sonsofbitches...\", I screamed at them. They merely laughed, and didn't care at all. Those crazy eyes kept looking at me until my very last breath. But at least I could have peace finally. Or could I?", "headerimage": "http://www.cufbi.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/morgue-feet.jpg", "highlight": "0", "series": ""}, {"id": 32, "title": "Revenge is a mindless beast", "authors": "1", "date_created": "2017-01-24 00:00:00", "date_published": "2017-01-25 21:43:00", "date_updated": "2017-01-25 16:21:47", "is_published": "1", "short_description": "The quest of a man and his revenge", "tags": "103,62", "slug": "revenge-is-a-mindless-beast", "body_type": "markdown", "body_text": "<p>They say death is the great equaliser.

In the darkness of dawn she could see the glittering firefly inside, its light pulsating at a rhythm much like her heartbeat. Watching the faint shimmering glow made her calm and peaceful, and she closed her eyes. Around her the birds cried and the butterflies fluttered, both venturing forth into the new day. She stayed on the grass, her clothes wet from the dew she had rolled over, feeling the warmth of the light in her hands, an unknown wisp of a smile on her lips, and gaiety in her heart.</p>\n<p>Fireflies had always been mythical for her. She had seen glimpses of pulsing lights in the dark, and she longed to hold one in her hands. Each time she tried to catch them, the lights would suddenly disappear, only to reappear several feet away. And she would be sad how she couldn\u2019t catch one, but happy at the same time for having tried, and just for being around them.</p>\n<p>The day before,  she walked home from school, arms swinging freely, happily moving her feet along the road, hearing the sound of the jingling bells as the cattle made their way back, a song playing on her lips, completely lost in her thoughts - and those saw her were comforted at her sight, just like the like the pulsing lights in the dark, and it made them happy.</p>\n<div class=\"tc\"><pre>\nA little light pulsing in the dark,\nAs I walk at night along the park,\nThere I see it, there I see it,\nAnd then it suddenly went so far;\n\nA little light pulsing nearby,\nI wonder if it was a firefly,\nJoys and sorrows it gave me,\nAs long as my eyes could see;\n\nA firefly of the green warm light,\nJust to see it was such a delight,\nI wonder if I can catch it at all,\nBut I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll stumble and fall;\n\nFairies if you believe in,\nA firefly is just their twin,\nMagical powers on its wings,\nWishes granted by divine beings;\n\nAll you needed was a glass jar,\nTo capture your own little star,\nA firefly always by your side,\nForever in your life, as your guide.\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Such a happy little song, such a happy little girl. As she danced her way around the cattle, the pits and the potholes, her foot stuck a stone she did not see, and she stumbled and fell, hands flat, nose an inch away, eyes wide, looking at the closeness of the dusty road. The song stopped and gave way to shock. Picking herself up, she realised that her hands and knees hurt. She looked at her hands, and the scratches and blood that was welling up around them. The torn patches around her dress. Tears welled up in her eyes, and she cried her way back to home. The little girl was happy no more.</p>\n<p>If there is one thing children do not like, it is being hurt from being hurt. Physical pain is but a reaction, it is the agony of losing out the joys that come from life that really makes them cry out. The little girl\u2019s wounds were cleaned, doctors called and medicines prescribed. She was to rest for a few days at home. No going to school, no going out to play. What must a child do with time? A child does not sit and ponder, a child does not sit and think. It went against nature. And this made her sad. And her sadness made others sad. For you see, sadness is a deadly disease. As soon as you see someone else is sad, you catch it as well. And if by chance you don\u2019t, then you\u2019ve something far worse already going on within you. </p>\n<p>Without playmates, and without school, the little girl spent her time walking about and fiddling with things. The maid scolded her, so she moved elsewhere. Mother scolded her, so she moved elsewhere. Father scolded her, and she had nowhere else to go. So she sat in a corner and cried some more. What must a parent do? Chocolates, cakes, and ice-creams were offered and rejected. Promises of picnics didn\u2019t hold a candle against being home-sick - the kind where one does not like to stay at home. The little warm pulsing light had disappeared in the darkness.</p>\n<p>Late night, when father arrived home, he came to her room and placed a glass jar by her bedside. She peered at it, puzzled at its empty contents, and then angry for having received it. When father switched off the light on his way out, she was still mad, and turned over to the other side of the bed. But just as she was drifting off to sleep, she faced the jar, and there it was - a magical little pulsing green light, moving about in the glass jar. She lay like that for the better part of the hour, too afraid that any movement she made might make the firefly go away. She drifted off to sleep half full of wonderment. The other half was simply afraid.</p>\n<p>When she awoke next morning, it was bright, and well past dawn. She remembered the firefly by her bedside and rushed to the table. Grabbing the jar with both hands, she peered inside with immense wonderment, but all she could see was a bug inside. Was that the firefly, she wondered. Why wasn\u2019t it shining then? Why won\u2019t it be bright and green? She pondered over it for a moment, and then touched her nose to the jar. The firefly inside gave off a faint glow. She was astonished to find that she had to squint her eyes to see it. Was it that the fireflies only gave off their magical light in the dark? Or was it that we saw it as being magical because of the dark? At that moment, breakfast was announced, and she kept the jar and her thoughts away to rush downstairs.</p>\n<p>Breakfast was a plethora of her favourite things, mother\u2019s way of making everything all right. When mothers worry, they know what to do best. They make lots of food. There was cake - made out of fresh strawberries, and topped off with cream. There was warm toast, crisp and perfect. There were eggs, sunny side up, with ketchup in the shape of a smile. A glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. The stage was set for some epic healing, but mother need not have worried - the little girl was already happy and smiling by the time she reached the table. The doctor had tended to the wounds on the body, and the joy of possessing a firefly had healed the wounds inside. </p>\n<p>In time, physical wounds healed too. Some new ones were stumbled upon, some healed, some were forgotten. The firefly had lasted for a week. With holes in the lid for air, and a fresh leaf every day for it to eat, the little girl thought it would last forever. But one day she had awoken to simply find it dead. She was convinced that burying it in the garden would bring her good fortune. And so she dug with her bare hands - for effort had to be made for fortune to be bestowed - and gently placed the firefly in the ground and covered it in earth. Every night as she watched the lights dance from her window, she wondered, if one of them had risen from her garden, a new life, and was now free.</p>\n<p>One day, the little girl awoke to a great tragedy. Mother was cradling her, arms tightly wrapped around, tears running down her cheek, her mouth hanging open, but no words came out. The little girl wondered what had happened, as they rushed to the hospital, where the bright light hurt her eyes - she preferred the comfort of the dark - and the doctors and the nurses all looked at her with sympathy and with pity. Someone came along and took her to a corner while mother went inside, the doctor that held her arm took out of her pocket some chocolate, she refused - the doctor was a stranger - so the doctor pocketed it again. After a while, the doctor explained, that father had an accident, and he had gone far far away, to heaven, and that he wasn\u2019t coming back. Ever again. The little girl had yet to understand death, but it is instinct to mourn the loss of a loved one, and so tears streamed down her face, and her heart felt heavy, even though she did not quite understand why.</p>\n<p>When they returned home, everything seemed bleak, quiet, like something big had gone missing, like something had broken and needed fixing, and she wondered when daddy would get home, so that she could ask him to fix it, and then she remembered that daddy was never going to be home again. The pillow under her head had never been this wet with the tears ever before. Mother was a strong woman, and she took care of them both, even though she sometimes forgot to reheat the food, or take out the trash, or get the post in. But she was still there, and the house was still home, and life still kept happening. Where everything was slowly leaving the harsh coldness of winter, the little girl\u2019s sadness would not leave, no matter what everyone did. She was still sad, and it seemed to her that she would always remain so.</p>\n<p>Her school teachers were sympathetic, her classmates cautious, and her friends apologetic. She preferred eating her lunch alone, and had no desire to play. In time, she talked more, but everyone could still sense a lingering sadness that no one could touch or remove. Teachers had a talk with her mother, her friends\u2019s mothers had a talk with her mother, and picnics were arranged and gift baskets were delivered to the doorstep, but few trinkets of warmth found among them were gone by the time she woke up next morning. She\u2019s getting better, everyone agreed, unsure of it themselves, hoping that the words would encourage and comfort everyone else. Outside, the trees began sprouting new leaves, and dawn was happening sooner, and the birds were singing louder, and yet, inside the little girl\u2019s heart it was as dark as it had been.</p>\n<p>One day as she sat on the steps at night, watching the stars above in the great heaven, wondering if people really became stars after they were gone, and if heaven was really up there, and if her home was visible, and if daddy was looking down at her, and if he was, why wasn\u2019t he waving, and if she could even see him wave, and then she stopped thinking because the stars became blurry after a while and she had to wipe the tears from her eyes. When she looked back, mother had left by the door a glass of milk and a cookie, and there it was sitting in the corner - a jar just like her father had brought in one night by her bedside and it brought back memories and pain and loss and it hurt so bad she had to curl up and lie in the cold grass until she was numb all over. When she opened her eyes she could see the dancing little light in the jar, a firefly, glowing bright one moment and gone the next, just like the twinkling of stars above, and she wondered if the stars that fell from heaven became fireflies. It was exciting and scary. </p>\n<p>She got up and dusted the dirt off her dress, and walked over to the doorstep, carefully moving aside the milk and the cookie and picked up the jar in her hands, and maybe it was not real, but she <em>felt</em> warmth in her hands. She sat with the jar placed in her lap, sipping milk in tiny sips, watching the firefly glow and fade, and disappear at times, and watching it come back after sometime. Knowing it would be there in the jar, it was oddly satisfying, and it was comforting. She had a bite from the cookie.</p>\n<p>What if people that went far far away forever went to heaven, and became stars, and stars that fell from heaven and came back to earth became fireflies? What if daddy decided to come back to meet her as a firefly? What if it\u2026 And then something horrible struck her mind and she froze, and her body became stiff and she clutched the jar in her hands, the empty glass of milk clattered away and fell askew by the doorstep. The ants didn\u2019t care for they were busy carrying away the fallen cookie crumbs, while she thought what if she had trapped daddy in a jar, and she remembered what had happened to the firefly she had before, and then she was really scared, and suddenly she was trembling, shaking, too afraid of herself, facing a moment of panic.</p>\n<p>When children get scary thoughts, there is not much that can be done or said or explained or shown to get the fear out of them. The only way for them to overcome it is to be with someone they can trust to handle the <em>bad</em> things when they come or happen. But how does one explain to a child who thinks that their father is a firefly, and they might end up killing them, and that it sounds so absurd! To a child\u2019s brain, absurd has no meaning. To them, it is us adults who lack imagination, who lack understanding, who don\u2019t know why something cannot be possible, and thus it is impossible for us to explain that something is not true.  And the child knows this, even though they might not be able to put it in words or form concrete thoughts about it. But they know, they sense this, and that\u2019s why sometimes they sleep in the parent\u2019s bed, because between mommy and daddy lies the safest place on earth. And so the little girl curled up beside her mom, who was too tired and fast asleep to notice, the jar placed carefully on the other side. Sleep was more comforting and necessary at that point than any other thought one could ever have. Sleep is bliss, sleep is silence.</p>\n<p>Around just before dawn, for some reason we cannot know about, the little girl stirred awake, and slipped out in the darkness, glass jar in hands, blanket wrapped tightly around, slippers in feet, and an odd sense of adventure in the air. It was too early to be dawn, but she could sense it was near. Country-folk are always able to do that, we who live in the cities are too accustomed to our soft beds in enclosed boxes, but the way the cold night turns in to a fresh day is something deeply fixated in instinct and that\u2019s why no one has to teach animals when it is going to be dawn soon. The little girl walked along, aimless, looking at the stars, a little scared of her thoughts from before, unsure of where she should begin. </p>\n<p>The green light fluttering in and out of darkness was her guide, and it didn\u2019t really point anywhere in particular, so she sat down where she was, and kept the jar in front of her, and stared at it long and hard. She thought about herself for the first time in days - well, that\u2019s not true, because children always think of themselves, like all the time, because anything they think has to pass through them, and their thoughts are really so simple that everything somehow comes back to being centred around them and the world doesn\u2019t really concern them much beyond a little curiosity which we adults seem to have lost at some point along the way - but for the little girl, she thought about what was happening with her. She remembered being sad for long, and now that she had the firefly with her, she was happy, but she was not sure, because she was supposed to say that she was happy <em>because</em> she had the firefly, but she did not feel happy, and this confused her. So maybe she was not happy?</p>\n<p>But then why was she not happy? She had the firefly, so she <em>should</em> have been happy, but she wasn\u2019t, so she tried finding why not. It\u2019s not easy to come up with answers, but it is very easy to be distracted and to veer of somewhere else and then find answers there, and that is what she did. For the first time, she thought about the firefly - after being scared silly into thinking it could be her daddy, which she knew, timidly, that it wasn\u2019t, but she was a child, so fear lingers, which we know happens with us adults as well - she thought for the first time how the firefly was \u2018trapped\u2019 in the glass jar, and maybe that meant something. She thought for the first time how the firefly she had before, the one she had made air holes in the lid to breathe, and had put a fresh leaf in everyday for it to eat, had simply stopped moving one day, and maybe that was what happened with daddy as well, and it was a little closer to truth. </p>\n<p>She thought for the first time of herself as a firefly, trapped in a jar, though she knew not what the jar in the actual world would be - the house looked like a house and not a jar, and besides, it did not have a lid - but she <em>knew</em> the jar meant something and so she continued thinking of herself as a firefly. And she did not like sitting in one place, and eating the same dish everyday, and not going out to play, and maybe that\u2019s why the firefly had stopped moving - because it was sad from doing all that, and maybe that was why daddy went away - because daddy was sad about something and the sadness wouldn\u2019t go away, and so one day he stopped moving as well, and maybe the way to not go far far away was to not be sad. And she sat and pondered some more on this, the blanket wrapped around her, warm and comfortable, as the skies turned a slight shade brighter, and the trees awakened and swayed in the slight winds, and the birds knew it was dawn, and had begun their singing, and she joined them.</p>\n<div class=\"tc\"><pre>\nA little light in the dark,\nIn this night, cold and stark,\nAn angel come from above,\nTo shower me in light and love.\n\nGrant me a wish, so I say,\nI close my eyes, here I pray,\nGive me joys, and no more sorrow,\nTake me back home, on the morrow.\n\nA little light pulsing nearby,\nIs it really just a firefly,\nTrapped inside a jar,\nFrom the skies, a fallen star.\n\nA firefly of green light,\nShining with a joy so bright,\nIn my hands the jar I take,\nTo see it go is a heartache.\n\nI wonder with a smile,\nI know it\u2019ll come back in a while,\nI want it to be my guide,\nI\u2019ll wait until it is by my side.\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>And as she lay on the cold moist grass, with the dew strewn about her like little fallen pearls, the glass jar open and empty, the firefly dancing in the fading darkness of the dawn, her gaze on its pulsating rhythm that shimmered like her heartbeat, its glow growing fainter and fading away as the sky got brighter, finally lost amongst the fluttering of the birds starting a new day, her heart filled with long lost happiness that she somehow knew would last her a lifetime.</p>", "body": "There she lay on the cold moist grass, wet blades running between her toes, eyes fixed on the glass jar in her hand. In the darkness of dawn she could see the glittering firefly inside, its light pulsating at a rhythm much like her heartbeat. Watching the faint shimmering glow made her calm and peaceful, and she closed her eyes. Around her the birds cried and the butterflies fluttered, both venturing forth into the new day. She stayed on the grass, her clothes wet from the dew she had rolled over, feeling the warmth of the light in her hands, an unknown wisp of a smile on her lips, and gaiety in her heart.\r\n\r\nFireflies had always been mythical for her. She had seen glimpses of pulsing lights in the dark, and she longed to hold one in her hands. Each time she tried to catch them, the lights would suddenly disappear, only to reappear several feet away. And she would be sad how she couldn\u2019t catch one, but happy at the same time for having tried, and just for being around them.\r\n\r\nThe day before,  she walked home from school, arms swinging freely, happily moving her feet along the road, hearing the sound of the jingling bells as the cattle made their way back, a song playing on her lips, completely lost in her thoughts - and those saw her were comforted at her sight, just like the like the pulsing lights in the dark, and it made them happy.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"tc\"><pre>\r\nA little light pulsing in the dark,\r\nAs I walk at night along the park,\r\nThere I see it, there I see it,\r\nAnd then it suddenly went so far;\r\n\r\nA little light pulsing nearby,\r\nI wonder if it was a firefly,\r\nJoys and sorrows it gave me,\r\nAs long as my eyes could see;\r\n\r\nA firefly of the green warm light,\r\nJust to see it was such a delight,\r\nI wonder if I can catch it at all,\r\nBut I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll stumble and fall;\r\n\r\nFairies if you believe in,\r\nA firefly is just their twin,\r\nMagical powers on its wings,\r\nWishes granted by divine beings;\r\n\r\nAll you needed was a glass jar,\r\nTo capture your own little star,\r\nA firefly always by your side,\r\nForever in your life, as your guide.\r\n</pre></div>\r\n\r\nSuch a happy little song, such a happy little girl. As she danced her way around the cattle, the pits and the potholes, her foot stuck a stone she did not see, and she stumbled and fell, hands flat, nose an inch away, eyes wide, looking at the closeness of the dusty road. The song stopped and gave way to shock. Picking herself up, she realised that her hands and knees hurt. She looked at her hands, and the scratches and blood that was welling up around them. The torn patches around her dress. Tears welled up in her eyes, and she cried her way back to home. The little girl was happy no more.\r\n\r\nIf there is one thing children do not like, it is being hurt from being hurt. Physical pain is but a reaction, it is the agony of losing out the joys that come from life that really makes them cry out. The little girl\u2019s wounds were cleaned, doctors called and medicines prescribed. She was to rest for a few days at home. No going to school, no going out to play. What must a child do with time? A child does not sit and ponder, a child does not sit and think. It went against nature. And this made her sad. And her sadness made others sad. For you see, sadness is a deadly disease. As soon as you see someone else is sad, you catch it as well. And if by chance you don\u2019t, then you\u2019ve something far worse already going on within you. \r\n\r\nWithout playmates, and without school, the little girl spent her time walking about and fiddling with things. The maid scolded her, so she moved elsewhere. Mother scolded her, so she moved elsewhere. Father scolded her, and she had nowhere else to go. So she sat in a corner and cried some more. What must a parent do? Chocolates, cakes, and ice-creams were offered and rejected. Promises of picnics didn\u2019t hold a candle against being home-sick - the kind where one does not like to stay at home. The little warm pulsing light had disappeared in the darkness.\r\n\r\nLate night, when father arrived home, he came to her room and placed a glass jar by her bedside. She peered at it, puzzled at its empty contents, and then angry for having received it. When father switched off the light on his way out, she was still mad, and turned over to the other side of the bed. But just as she was drifting off to sleep, she faced the jar, and there it was - a magical little pulsing green light, moving about in the glass jar. She lay like that for the better part of the hour, too afraid that any movement she made might make the firefly go away. She drifted off to sleep half full of wonderment. The other half was simply afraid.\r\n\r\nWhen she awoke next morning, it was bright, and well past dawn. She remembered the firefly by her bedside and rushed to the table. Grabbing the jar with both hands, she peered inside with immense wonderment, but all she could see was a bug inside. Was that the firefly, she wondered. Why wasn\u2019t it shining then? Why won\u2019t it be bright and green? She pondered over it for a moment, and then touched her nose to the jar. The firefly inside gave off a faint glow. She was astonished to find that she had to squint her eyes to see it. Was it that the fireflies only gave off their magical light in the dark? Or was it that we saw it as being magical because of the dark? At that moment, breakfast was announced, and she kept the jar and her thoughts away to rush downstairs.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was a plethora of her favourite things, mother\u2019s way of making everything all right. When mothers worry, they know what to do best. They make lots of food. There was cake - made out of fresh strawberries, and topped off with cream. There was warm toast, crisp and perfect. There were eggs, sunny side up, with ketchup in the shape of a smile. A glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. The stage was set for some epic healing, but mother need not have worried - the little girl was already happy and smiling by the time she reached the table. The doctor had tended to the wounds on the body, and the joy of possessing a firefly had healed the wounds inside. \r\n\r\nIn time, physical wounds healed too. Some new ones were stumbled upon, some healed, some were forgotten. The firefly had lasted for a week. With holes in the lid for air, and a fresh leaf every day for it to eat, the little girl thought it would last forever. But one day she had awoken to simply find it dead. She was convinced that burying it in the garden would bring her good fortune. And so she dug with her bare hands - for effort had to be made for fortune to be bestowed - and gently placed the firefly in the ground and covered it in earth. Every night as she watched the lights dance from her window, she wondered, if one of them had risen from her garden, a new life, and was now free.\r\n\r\nOne day, the little girl awoke to a great tragedy. Mother was cradling her, arms tightly wrapped around, tears running down her cheek, her mouth hanging open, but no words came out. The little girl wondered what had happened, as they rushed to the hospital, where the bright light hurt her eyes - she preferred the comfort of the dark - and the doctors and the nurses all looked at her with sympathy and with pity. Someone came along and took her to a corner while mother went inside, the doctor that held her arm took out of her pocket some chocolate, she refused - the doctor was a stranger - so the doctor pocketed it again. After a while, the doctor explained, that father had an accident, and he had gone far far away, to heaven, and that he wasn\u2019t coming back. Ever again. The little girl had yet to understand death, but it is instinct to mourn the loss of a loved one, and so tears streamed down her face, and her heart felt heavy, even though she did not quite understand why.\r\n\r\nWhen they returned home, everything seemed bleak, quiet, like something big had gone missing, like something had broken and needed fixing, and she wondered when daddy would get home, so that she could ask him to fix it, and then she remembered that daddy was never going to be home again. The pillow under her head had never been this wet with the tears ever before. Mother was a strong woman, and she took care of them both, even though she sometimes forgot to reheat the food, or take out the trash, or get the post in. But she was still there, and the house was still home, and life still kept happening. Where everything was slowly leaving the harsh coldness of winter, the little girl\u2019s sadness would not leave, no matter what everyone did. She was still sad, and it seemed to her that she would always remain so.\r\n\r\nHer school teachers were sympathetic, her classmates cautious, and her friends apologetic. She preferred eating her lunch alone, and had no desire to play. In time, she talked more, but everyone could still sense a lingering sadness that no one could touch or remove. Teachers had a talk with her mother, her friends\u2019s mothers had a talk with her mother, and picnics were arranged and gift baskets were delivered to the doorstep, but few trinkets of warmth found among them were gone by the time she woke up next morning. She\u2019s getting better, everyone agreed, unsure of it themselves, hoping that the words would encourage and comfort everyone else. Outside, the trees began sprouting new leaves, and dawn was happening sooner, and the birds were singing louder, and yet, inside the little girl\u2019s heart it was as dark as it had been.\r\n\r\nOne day as she sat on the steps at night, watching the stars above in the great heaven, wondering if people really became stars after they were gone, and if heaven was really up there, and if her home was visible, and if daddy was looking down at her, and if he was, why wasn\u2019t he waving, and if she could even see him wave, and then she stopped thinking because the stars became blurry after a while and she had to wipe the tears from her eyes.

Knowing it would be there in the jar, it was oddly satisfying, and it was comforting. She had a bite from the cookie.\r\n\r\nWhat if people that went far far away forever went to heaven, and became stars, and stars that fell from heaven and came back to earth became fireflies? What if daddy decided to come back to meet her as a firefly? What if it\u2026 And then something horrible struck her mind and she froze, and her body became stiff and she clutched the jar in her hands, the empty glass of milk clattered away and fell askew by the doorstep. The ants didn\u2019t care for they were busy carrying away the fallen cookie crumbs, while she thought what if she had trapped daddy in a jar, and she remembered what had happened to the firefly she had before, and then she was really scared, and suddenly she was trembling, shaking, too afraid of herself, facing a moment of panic.\r\n\r\nWhen children get scary thoughts, there is not much that can be done or said or explained or shown to get the fear out of them. The only way for them to overcome it is to be with someone they can trust to handle the _bad_ things when they come or happen. But how does one explain to a child who thinks that their father is a firefly, and they might end up killing them, and that it sounds so absurd! To a child\u2019s brain, absurd has no meaning. To them, it is us adults who lack imagination, who lack understanding, who don\u2019t know why something cannot be possible, and thus it is impossible for us to explain that something is not true.

And she sat and pondered some more on this, the blanket wrapped around her, warm and comfortable, as the skies turned a slight shade brighter, and the trees awakened and swayed in the slight winds, and the birds knew it was dawn, and had begun their singing, and she joined them.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"tc\"><pre>\r\nA little light in the dark,\r\nIn this night, cold and stark,\r\nAn angel come from above,\r\nTo shower me in light and love.\r\n\r\nGrant me a wish, so I say,\r\nI close my eyes, here I pray,\r\nGive me joys, and no more sorrow,\r\nTake me back home, on the morrow.\r\n\r\nA little light pulsing nearby,\r\nIs it really just a firefly,\r\nTrapped inside a jar,\r\nFrom the skies, a fallen star.\r\n\r\nA firefly of green light,\r\nShining with a joy so bright,\r\nIn my hands the jar I take,\r\nTo see it go is a heartache.\r\n\r\nI wonder with a smile,\r\nI know it\u2019ll come back in a while,\r\nI want it to be my guide,\r\nI\u2019ll wait until it is by my side.\r\n</pre></div>\r\n\r\nAnd as she lay on the cold moist grass, with the dew strewn about her like little fallen pearls, the glass jar open and empty, the firefly dancing in the fading darkness of the dawn, her gaze on its pulsating rhythm that shimmered like her heartbeat, its glow growing fainter and fading away as the sky got brighter, finally lost amongst the fluttering of the birds starting a new day, her heart filled with long lost happiness that she somehow knew would last her a lifetime.", "headerimage": "https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/media/2016/firefly.jpg", "highlight": "0", "series": ""}, {"id": 30, "title": "The Godman", "authors": "1", "date_created": "2016-07-20 17:55:00", "date_published": "2016-07-20 17:55:00", "date_updated": "2016-07-20 18:01:31", "is_published": "1", "short_description": "A man claims he can talk to god.

The television set was an antique model, more than 10 years old, its picture grainy and jarring. The sound was tiny, barely audible, and often had mournful jolts of alternating noise and silence. The family huddled together to fit in front of the tiny screen, a regular ritual since the many years no one kept count of. </p>\n<p>The news started its onslaught with a blast of music and flashing signs and flying panels all over the screen. It boasted of how it had changed the life for each person ever since its inception all those years ago, how it was the best channel there simply ever could be, and anyone who dared receive their news from a different source was a moron. The anchor had put on a sharp suit that emphasised money and business. The studio was entirely made of glass, one could see the news people working on their desks behind. The upper corner flashed the channel\u2019s logo, a constant sign and reminder of the patronage it commanded. The bottom was a ticker tape of breaking news, and nothing else. It seemed the channel only catered to reporting breaking news, or reported every news as breaking, no one could challenge or claim to know the difference anymore. The mood in the dingy hut where the family sat became solemn as the vehement anchor began the tirade of questions without answers, accusations without facts, and conclusions without consensus. No one questioned any of it, no one changed the channel. </p>\n<p>The breaking story for the day was about <strong>The Godman</strong>, which ran with a constant question that provoked an irrational response in any viewer looking for facts. <em>\"Scam or Mentally ill?\"</em>, screamed and asked both the ticker tape and the anchor.

It seemed the entire universe could only offer these two choices, that the Godman was either a scam, or was mentally ill, and any other illusion of an option eventually led back to either of these. The anchor did a good job of turning around conversations at the drop of a word, or raiding logical assertions with cheap rhetorics that compelled an answer at the threat of morality.

The television set was an antique model, more than 10 years old, its picture grainy and jarring. The sound was tiny, barely audible, and often had mournful jolts of alternating noise and silence. The family huddled together to fit in front of the tiny screen, a regular ritual since the many years no one kept count of. \r\n \r\nThe news started its onslaught with a blast of music and flashing signs and flying panels all over the screen. It boasted of how it had changed the life for each person ever since its inception all those years ago, how it was the best channel there simply ever could be, and anyone who dared receive their news from a different source was a moron. The anchor had put on a sharp suit that emphasised money and business. The studio was entirely made of glass, one could see the news people working on their desks behind. The upper corner flashed the channel\u2019s logo, a constant sign and reminder of the patronage it commanded. The bottom was a ticker tape of breaking news, and nothing else. It seemed the channel only catered to reporting breaking news, or reported every news as breaking, no one could challenge or claim to know the difference anymore. The mood in the dingy hut where the family sat became solemn as the vehement anchor began the tirade of questions without answers, accusations without facts, and conclusions without consensus. No one questioned any of it, no one changed the channel. \r\n \r\nThe breaking story for the day was about **The Godman**, which ran with a constant question that provoked an irrational response in any viewer looking for facts. _\"Scam or Mentally ill?\"_, screamed and asked both the ticker tape and the anchor.

They had been going out for many months now, and it was time to take things forward. He had scourged many shops, but had not found a ring perfect enough to express his love for her. The long period of waiting had exposed the fear and doubts in his mind. He wanted to express his love to her, his wish to be together for the rest of their lives. But he couldn\u2019t find the courage to do it, no matter how hard he tried. He knew that she too wanted this, but he still could not find the strength to say it out loud. Thus, his life was starting to turn into a frustrating experience.\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p>As the couple walked, both lost in their own thoughts, a ring rolled down the grass and along the road into their feet. It rolled and rolled as it missed the feet of the girl and slowed down at the guy\u2019s feet, loudly clinking as it stopped on the ground. The sudden sound broke the guy\u2019s chain of thoughts and he looked down to see the ring at his feet. Surprised, he picked it up and held it across his face in the sunshine.\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p>The sunlight bounced off the intricate markings and the gemstone shone and sparkled to life. The world was lost into darkness as if the gem had sucked up all the light, and was proudly displaying it\u2019s hoarded loot, reflected in the holders eyes. His feet stopped, and he continued to stare at the ring, lost to the enchantment of the ring\u2019s beauty.<p><br></p><p>The girl stopped after a while, finally realizing that she was walking alone. She turned back, but the guy was nowhere to be found. Puzzled, she turned round and round, wondering where he might have gone, and finally started walking back. After a while, as she reached the place where the guy found the ring, though at that time she was unaware of this fact, she felt a gentle tap on her shoulders. Turning around, she was surprised to see an upheld ring, shining brightly enough to drown the sun, in the hands of her boyfriend, who was looking at her with an expression of utmost romance and passion. Taking her hand into his, he slipped the ring onto her finger, and she felt a great warmth touch her hand, and spread into her arms and shoulders, and from there to her heart.\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p>As the sun set in the distant horizon, the two lovers, now engaged, watched, their fingers entwined, feeling the warmth and love in each other, glad for the sudden turn of events, oblivious to the fact that the ring that had brought them together had slipped off her finger and had rolled away long ago as they had walked together to their new life.<br>\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><hr><p><br>\r\n</p><p>The cafe was busy, bustling with people coming in and going out. A few brave customers sat outside, nervously watchig the dark clouds overhead and praying for avoiding a downpour as they sipped their coffee. A young pair of lovers sat in their midst, visibly upset with each other over some minor tiff. The guy, lean in appearance, sat with his legs crossed, an arm flung careless on the back of his chair, his neck turned away to avoid looking straight ahead at her. The girl, pretty, but without makeup, adjusted her trendy skirt as she sat with her legs close together under the table, hands on her legs, watching him with fiery eyes. <br>\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p>The waiter came around and picked up the empty cups, overtly annoyed by the annoyed looks on everyone\u2019s faces. As if waiting for this particular cue, the couple got up, still avoiding looking at each other, and walked out to the road just as thunder roared above them.\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p>A cyclist rode past them, and caused the girl to shift closer, causing great discomfort to them both as they became aware of the contact their skins made when touched. They looked at each other, and then quickly looked away, shy and guilty about just having done that. Young love had its charms, but it also had its annoyances.\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p>To quickly find an event to warrant an interest in something else, they both noticed the old antique ring lying at the end of the sidewalk. It dangled by its edge, as if threatning to fall over into the drain if they didn\u2019t quickly pick it up.

A great old couple walked one of these sidewalks, in the slow and staggering manner that only old people can pull off. The husband moved with the help of his walking stick, pausing ever so often to adjust his glasses and view the world up ahead.

Which lead to the start of another argument.\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p>The bum watched as the old couple moved away, walking slowly, arguing loudly, and sighed. Just as he was about to give up watching them, he heard the sound of metal against the stone of the sidewalk, and looked down to see a ring rolling past him, towards the couple, barely missing the feets of oncoming pedestrians. The ring was perfectly round, and made up of smooth and shiny gold.

Finally, he managed to grasp the ring and felt the coldness of the metal that reached into his bones. He pocketed the ring, and looked around, suddenly afraid that its owner, or someone, would come running after it and take it away from him.<p><br>\r\n</p><p>He retreated to his home, a dump in an alley, where the smoulders from a fire were still billowing smoke. He threw in a few more papers, and started a fire, drawing a blanket around him. In its warmth, he held the ring in front of his face, watching the fire dance in its markings, an ancient script too difficult to comprehend, but powerful to hold, and whispered, \u201c<em>my precious\u2026</em>\"\r\n</p>", "body": "<p>The guy fumbled forward, his feet exposing the uncertainty in his mind as he walked behind his girlfriend. They had been going out for many months now, and it was time to take things forward. He had scourged many shops, but had not found a ring perfect enough to express his love for her. The long period of waiting had exposed the fear and doubts in his mind. He wanted to express his love to her, his wish to be together for the rest of their lives. But he couldn\u2019t find the courage to do it, no matter how hard he tried. He knew that she too wanted this, but he still could not find the strength to say it out loud. Thus, his life was starting to turn into a frustrating experience.\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p>As the couple walked, both lost in their own thoughts, a ring rolled down the grass and along the road into their feet. It rolled and rolled as it missed the feet of the girl and slowed down at the guy\u2019s feet, loudly clinking as it stopped on the ground. The sudden sound broke the guy\u2019s chain of thoughts and he looked down to see the ring at his feet. Surprised, he picked it up and held it across his face in the sunshine.\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p>The sunlight bounced off the intricate markings and the gemstone shone and sparkled to life. The world was lost into darkness as if the gem had sucked up all the light, and was proudly displaying it\u2019s hoarded loot, reflected in the holders eyes. His feet stopped, and he continued to stare at the ring, lost to the enchantment of the ring\u2019s beauty.<p><br></p><p>The girl stopped after a while, finally realizing that she was walking alone. She turned back, but the guy was nowhere to be found. Puzzled, she turned round and round, wondering where he might have gone, and finally started walking back. After a while, as she reached the place where the guy found the ring, though at that time she was unaware of this fact, she felt a gentle tap on her shoulders. Turning around, she was surprised to see an upheld ring, shining brightly enough to drown the sun, in the hands of her boyfriend, who was looking at her with an expression of utmost romance and passion. Taking her hand into his, he slipped the ring onto her finger, and she felt a great warmth touch her hand, and spread into her arms and shoulders, and from there to her heart.\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p>As the sun set in the distant horizon, the two lovers, now engaged, watched, their fingers entwined, feeling the warmth and love in each other, glad for the sudden turn of events, oblivious to the fact that the ring that had brought them together had slipped off her finger and had rolled away long ago as they had walked together to their new life.<br>\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><hr><p><br>\r\n</p><p>The cafe was busy, bustling with people coming in and going out. A few brave customers sat outside, nervously watchig the dark clouds overhead and praying for avoiding a downpour as they sipped their coffee. A young pair of lovers sat in their midst, visibly upset with each other over some minor tiff. The guy, lean in appearance, sat with his legs crossed, an arm flung careless on the back of his chair, his neck turned away to avoid looking straight ahead at her. The girl, pretty, but without makeup, adjusted her trendy skirt as she sat with her legs close together under the table, hands on her legs, watching him with fiery eyes. <br>\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p>The waiter came around and picked up the empty cups, overtly annoyed by the annoyed looks on everyone\u2019s faces. As if waiting for this particular cue, the couple got up, still avoiding looking at each other, and walked out to the road just as thunder roared above them.\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p>A cyclist rode past them, and caused the girl to shift closer, causing great discomfort to them both as they became aware of the contact their skins made when touched. They looked at each other, and then quickly looked away, shy and guilty about just having done that. Young love had its charms, but it also had its annoyances.\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p>To quickly find an event to warrant an interest in something else, they both noticed the old antique ring lying at the end of the sidewalk. It dangled by its edge, as if threatning to fall over into the drain if they didn\u2019t quickly pick it up. The same thought crossed into both their minds, and as they reached down to pick it up, and found the ring to be held in both their hands, the symbol of truce.<p><br>\r\n</p><p>As they were getting back up, they looked at each other and smiled.

Still keeping her eyes closed, she stretched her hands above her head. Satisfied that they had gone as high as they could, she opened her eyes, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Presents!!!!&rdquo;. With an enthusiastic roar, she jumped off the bed and ran straight towards the boxes gathered on the table. A single stream of light was falling on the ones that had managed to sneak away to the couch. She decided to go after them first. She took a present in her hands, and waited a customary few seconds, guessing what was inside. But the very act of guessing made her feel as if she was robbing herself of a surprise. Giving up quickly, she sat on the floor, and started opening the presents. She gave shouts of glee, as she liked the things she was unwrapping. The morning light had spread to the rest of her room when she finally finished. She got up to go downstairs for breakfast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As she walked the stairs, she was greeted by a chorus of the birthday song, and she smiled at her family. She went and hugged each one of them with delight. There was her nanny first, who made the world&rsquo;s most delicious cakes. Then her nanna, who could tell the most fun stories she had ever heard or seen anywhere. Her brother, younger than her, was grinning and teasing her. She punched him lightly on the shoulder, but smiled all the same. Her mama had tears in her eyes, but was still smiling at her. She knew she was missing her papa, who was no more. Years ago, he had gone in the woods, and had been stuck in the snow there. Everyone thought that her papa had caught the plague, and that&rsquo;s why had been unable to return. She preferred not to think about it. It always made her sad, and scared her to the point that she could never go further. She went to her mama and wiped her tears and stretched her lips into a crooked smile. Her mama laughed and hugged her. They all sat down at the table for breakfast, and because it was her birthday, she said grace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later in the afternoon, she went to the hills on the outskirts of their village. She always went there on her birthday. It had been that way for years, beyond the time when she could remember, or count. She always went to the big oak tree, withered and alone in the snow. There was nothing for miles here, only this tree, and it was easy to find her way even though it was still snowing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once she had reached the tree, she stopped and sat down, panting. It wasn&rsquo;t easy climbing a hill filled in snow. Adjusting her scarf more tightly around herself, she got up and went to the other side. The tree had a hole, half-filled with the falling snow. She scooped up the snow and threw it out. A few more times, and she reached the bark underneath, and her hands found a chrysanthemum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She picked up the flower and took it with her. She had never bothered to question who had placed the flower there or why. For years she had been coming here, she had always found the flower, safe in the bark, waiting for her. It was almost as if she&nbsp;<em>knew</em>&nbsp;of its existence and had impulsively taken it out. Her eyes travelled to the wood above the hole, where a crude knife had cut through to make a small girl. Her hair was tied in a pony-tail, just like hers. And she wore a skirt with big circles on it. She looked very happy and was probably dancing in a garden of chrysanthemums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To another person, the statue would have looked nothing like her descriptions. It was almost as if her mind knew what to make of the cuts and crevices in the wood, and she had merely believed the first image her mind came up with. But somehow, she had believed that the girl was real, and she knew her, perhaps in another life. Before turning back home, she brushed the snow off the wooden girl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As she walked a few more steps downhill, she paused and frowned. Turning back, she ran to the other side of the hill. An old man was trying to climb up. He struggled against the fresh snow as it swallowed his legs and his wooden stick. She freed him of his captivity, and helped him to the oak tree. Leaving her hands, he tightened his coat against the wind. The coat was nothing more than a collection of rags. He felt the immediate warmth in his lungs as she put her scarf around him. She watched him look at her in surprise, and saw warmth in his eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he was near the tree, she watched him go over to the statue and pause. Being greatly intrigued, she didn&rsquo;t move at all as he removed a chrysanthemum from his coat pocket. He lay the flower gently in the hole, and moved to the statue, running his hands over the girl. Hot, warm, tears streamed down his eyes, as he held the tree for support. She moved near him, holding him. He was crying, saying &ldquo;<em>Martha&hellip;</em>&rdquo; over and over again. The name triggered a great deal of broken memories in her. She saw the girl come alive, saw the garden of chrysanthemums, and saw a wooden house behind. She saw the old man, now younger, play with the girl, as she ran out in the garden. She felt her head grow dizzy and held the tree for support. She now heard, a great many shouts, in the woods, calling her name. She was a little girl, crying alone in the woods. She was now eating hot porridge, with the other girl beside her. She was playing with the other girl in a chrysanthemum garden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barely breathing, she panted, as she struggled for air. She watched the statue again, and saw herself there.&nbsp;<em>Her</em>&nbsp;hair tied in a pony tail,&nbsp;<em>her</em>&nbsp;blue skirt filled with big red dots, as she laughed and ran through the chrysanthemum garden. She saw the old man chasing&nbsp;<em>her</em>, gasping for breath, saying, &ldquo;<em>Martha, wait!</em>&rdquo;. She fainted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As she fell in the snow, she welcomed the cold as it numbed her head. It removed the pain, and filled her with darkness. She was helpless as the darkness broke away a dam of memories. They seared through the cold, and her head hurt again. Lying in the snow, she watched herself and her childhood come alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was Martha in this other life. A small girl who loved chrysanthemums. Every year her father and mother planted gardens of flowers in the hills. She laughed, and played in them, watched over by her grandpa, while her parents went selling the flowers. One day she got lost in the woods, and came across another girl, crying, tugging the hands of a man fallen on the ground. She had approached her cautiously, and known that something was seriously wrong with the man. He wasn&rsquo;t moving, and he was not asleep either. Not knowing what else to do, the two girls had sat beneath the tree, hand in hand, scared. Hours later, her grandpa had come searching for her. He had taken both of them home, and bathe them in warm water. She and the other girl sat on the table, eating hot porridge in wooden bowls. The other girl started to live with them. She became her friend, and played with her in the gardens. When her parents had returned, her mother had clutched the two of them together, and cried. Her father had gone with grandpa back into the woods. They had returned smelling of oil and smoke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Months later, her parents had grown sick and never moved from their beds. The little girl was sick as well. She had cried for weeks. One by one, they all had stopped moving, just like the man in the forest. And she and her grandpa used to lay awake at nights, crying in each others arms. Neither of them could have survived the loss of the other. The snow had started melting, and her grandpa had taken her to this very hill. He dug graves for her parents, and the little girl, and planted chrysanthemums over them. Then going to the oak tree, he placed one chrysanthemum in the hole. He removed his knife and cut the girl on the wood. She had asked him who the girl was. And he had said, &ldquo;<em>It&rsquo;s you Martha. So that you are always with your mama and papa.</em>&rdquo; And she had cried all the way home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the time summer came, her grandpa had lain on the bed, his skin too hot to touch. She hadn&rsquo;t known what to do except carry on somehow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One day, he had called her, and with great difficulty, explained, that she had to leave. She hadn&rsquo;t understood what he meant by leave. He asked her to go by the river, and to keep walking until she met someone, and to go with them and never come back. She had refused, and had run away from the room. This happened for days, as the old man used his last energy to cajole her, prepare her, just so that she would survive. She had finally agreed, tears streaming down her face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day, she set out early morning, with food and water, and had walked by the river. On the way, a bear had appeared in front of her, and she had ran away screaming in to the woods. Soon she was lost, and could not fathom which way the river was. She walked till her food was over and her water bottle empty. Somehow, she had ended up in this village, and had dragged herself over to a house, and fallen unconscious at it&rsquo;s doorstep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The family had taken her in, taken care of her, and after a while, adopted her. She had soon forgotten her old life, her mind suppressing the trauma of losing everyone in her world. She had soon learned to accept the truth, which was, whatever her new family told her. By fate, it had been the other girls family, the one who had played with her, and died with her parents.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>The new family took great pains to help the traumatized little girl. For the mother, she had a daughter back, and she raised her as her own. When they learnt that her mind was too fragile to handle the loss, they told her she had always been here, in their home, safe amongst them. That her father had died in an accident in the woods, and that she was and would always be safe with them. Somehow, she had believed them, and this had helped her live. But somehow, through all those years and miseries, she had remembered the chrysanthemums.</div>", "body": "<div>\r\n<p>She woke up with a loud yawn.

She hadn&rsquo;t understood what he meant by leave. He asked her to go by the river, and to keep walking until she met someone, and to go with them and never come back. She had refused, and had run away from the room. This happened for days, as the old man used his last energy to cajole her, prepare her, just so that she would survive. She had finally agreed, tears streaming down her face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day, she set out early morning, with food and water, and had walked by the river. On the way, a bear had appeared in front of her, and she had ran away screaming in to the woods. Soon she was lost, and could not fathom which way the river was. She walked till her food was over and her water bottle empty. Somehow, she had ended up in this village, and had dragged herself over to a house, and fallen unconscious at it&rsquo;s doorstep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The family had taken her in, taken care of her, and after a while, adopted her. She had soon forgotten her old life, her mind suppressing the trauma of losing everyone in her world. She had soon learned to accept the truth, which was, whatever her new family told her. By fate, it had been the other girls family, the one who had played with her, and died with her parents.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>The new family took great pains to help the traumatized little girl. For the mother, she had a daughter back, and she raised her as her own. When they learnt that her mind was too fragile to handle the loss, they told her she had always been here, in their home, safe amongst them. That her father had died in an accident in the woods, and that she was and would always be safe with them. Somehow, she had believed them, and this had helped her live. But somehow, through all those years and miseries, she had remembered the chrysanthemums.</div>", "headerimage": "", "highlight": "1", "series": ""}, {"id": 27, "title": "Purple Dilation", "authors": "1", "date_created": "2015-10-28 12:50:56", "date_published": "2015-10-28 12:50:56", "date_updated": "2016-03-20 13:48:54", "is_published": "1", "short_description": "Purple Dilation", "tags": "62", "slug": "purple-dilation", "body_type": "html", "body_text": "<p>I stirred awake into the familiar environment of a cold metal bed and sterile air.

My hands and legs were perfectly tied down with straps so that I could not move. My neck had been covered with some sort of visor so that I couldn\u2019t turn my face around around the room. All I could see were the people and objects moving rapidly to and fro at the periphery of my eyes. And the bright lights, as always there were the bright lights. Five, seven, nine. Nine lights. Good. It was good to be in familiar environments. </p><p><br></p><p>I\u2019m sorry I did not introduce myself. It is difficult to be good with social manners if your role is essentially that of a lab rat. Anyways, hi, I\u2019m Subject 8E35EF, or Purple, if you fancy semantic names. My age is approximately 9 years, give or take a few months. I have been created and birthed right in this lab, where I took my formal education strapped to the very same bed. It was difficult to do the tests to see if I had learned well, but they were kind enough to do all the tests for me. Or on me, so to speak. </p><p><br></p><p>So far, I have noticed nothing special about myself that would warrant the attention that I get from all the wonderful people around me. Except for the dilation in my pupils, which turn purple. I haven\u2019t seen anyone else\u2019s eyes doing that, and most people always turn their eyes away when I try to look into theirs, so I can\u2019t really say that there\u2019s absolutely no one with the same condition as mine. I think that what I have is a rare and extraordinary defect, so to speak, and that these people are trying to find out about it and come up with a cure or an explanation, whichever they are lucky to get first.</p><p><br></p>The way I became aware of this condition of mine was entirely an unplanned event. I had been walking along the corridor when I saw that one of the doors had been left just a tiny bit open. Since I was forbidden to go into any room I had not been authorised for, I just peeked in to see a bright white room not unlike the other rooms here. There was a shiny metallic object on the wall in front of me that looked like a painting, but wasn\u2019t. My first guess was that it was another one of those monitors that are hung everywhere. But since the display was static, and oddly in context with the rest of the room, I discarded this idea. I moved about to get a different view of the room, and noticed that the display on the way moved as well. That was clever, the way it changed itself responding to my movements. I found it intriguing and continued to try out different movements to see what changes that produced. <p><br></p><p>In one such upward movement, I caught sight of the washbasin in the display. That was curious, because there was a washbasin right beneath the display, and I calculated that maybe the display shows things around itself. To test this theory, I matched the display with the things I could see in the room, and most if it was the same, albeit projected in an inverse manner. I sought to know what this phenomenon was and looked it up in the knowledge bank. I found out that the reflective surface was called a mirror, and is typically a glass surface coated with a metal amalgam to make it reflect images. The image inside the mirror is called a mirror image and is reflected with its structure inverted, which I found absurd and pointless as to its functionality unless it was for general amusement. </p><p><br></p><p>I looked into the mirror to see the door that I was standing outside of, and could make out the thin gap that allowed me to watch all of this. I could also see an outline, though far too incomplete, of a boy with brown hair and slight freckles around his chin, standing between the door gap with his eye directly in my line of vision. By inference, that could only be me, or my mirror image, since there was no one around me, and the line of sight between my eye and the mirror was clear of any obstructions. I continued to gaze at my features and compared them with the thousands of faces I had seen and read about. There was nothing specifically remarkable about myself except for the colour of my eyes. I noticed that my eyes were purple when they dilated, and this was a phenomenon I had no knowledge of even after extensively consulting the knowledge bank. </p><p><br></p><p>As far as I knew, the colour of the eye was caused by the pigmentation of the iris, and the scattering of light in the area around the iris called stroma. The  colours of the healthy eye are classified as light brown, black, blue, green, and grey with various shades between them. Sometimes, when a person has a medical condition called albinism, their eyes may appear red or violet under certain lighting conditions, but I did not exhibit any of the symptoms of albinism, so I discarded this condition even though purple was close to violet on the light spectrum.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Ever since that incident, I have been trying to find more abnormalities in myself. Since there is not much to do here for me, I find that a pleasant task to pass time with, so to speak. I have gone through the knowledge bank and have made notes as to the generic human characteristics that I think are easily verifiable and observable from the outside. The prime amongst this are things like the body structure - two arms, two legs, one head, a set of gonads, five fingers, five toes, two eyes, one pair of lips, a nose with two nostrils, two ears, and so on. Apart from the eye, I could find no discernible difference in myself.</p><p><br></p><p>Then I looked into the bodily characteristics of humans, with functioning organs such as the heart that pumped blood across the body, and systems such as the respiratory system that allowed one to breathe in oxygen to produce the energy needed to perform various functions. To check if I was breathing was an easy task, all I had to do was keep a finger on my nose and see if air went in and came out. It did, which was a relief, because according to the text, breathing was a vital sign of life. I checked my heartbeat, and my pulse, and they seemed to match the normal range of heartbeats a person is supposed to have - about 80 beats per minute. I could not perform a check on my other organs and systems since they required the use of lab equipment which I did not have access to, which seems ironic knowing that I essentially live in labs and am surrounded by such equipment, but also that I cannot touch or use them.</p><p><br></p>While browsing through the knowledge bank about more tests that identify or corroborate a functioning human being, I came across an interesting test called the <i>Turing\u2019s Test</i> which aims to determine if a person is a machine or a human. I found this fascinating, because I had never come across such a topic in any of my previous searches, and it offered a chance to learn new interesting things. I tried to lookup more about this test, and its associated topics such as artificial intelligence, but was cut off because these were unauthorised to access. I tried to read more about the test in the information currently available to me and understood that the basic format of this test consisted of a human judge that assessed the responses of two players to various questions involving natural language to determine which one of them is a human, and which one is the machine. Since I was short of a machine and an interested and willing human player, I tried to find ways to modify or interpret the tests to suit my current situation.<p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Every social test to see if an entity fits the norm of human behaviour has the implicit assumption that the said entity, if it be a human, has spent significant time living and adapting to the social behaviours of the society for a time period long enough to be able to mimic it in a test. Since I have been living in labs for as long as I can remember, I am certain that my concepts of art and music are certainly different than those perceived by society at large. The only aspect of a human that can remain a humane in spite of complete isolation from social phenomenons is instinct, which can also be programmed into a machine once it has been sufficiently identified in humans. For example, my fear of fire could be a primal response born out of instinct, or a set of logical directives that dictate that I must mimic this human sub-conscious behaviour. </p><p><br></p><p>The notion that humans can identify or create art is flawed since it necessitates that humans must first learn to understand the very concept of art, be conditioned to compare different works and determine the superior one before going on to say that they now understand art, but cannot explain it since it is an subconscious concept of the human creative mind. I find that argument absurd, since if this behaviour were to be mimicked by machines, all it would need is the logical directives that determine what art it, and what characteristics are considered to be desirable by society in general, and put it forth in a manner similar to how human conversation does. </p><p><br></p><p>I think it all comes down to data stored, whether it be by humans or by machines. Every action and response is first formed from the vestiges of previously stored data, which in humans would be called memories, and then matched rigorously against a heuristic pattern of decision making. The very intimate action of having thoughts, or thinking, is a non-distinguishing factor here, since it is impossible to determine what another person thinks, or how they think. Similarly, a machine cannot be aware of what thoughts are, unless it has access to someone else\u2019s thoughts, which apart from science fiction, is a general unreality.</p><p><br></p><p>The only option, and course of action that remains to me, therefore, is medical science. Although I have been prohibited from touching any of the lab equipments, think as hard as I might, I cannot remember any directive preventing me from touching reports and test results. So I can access the various reports strewn about the labs and can analyse whatever it is that's written in them. I have access to blood reports, neural activity reports, various scans and their associated reports, and  all data contained within them about me falls within the range of normal limits as specified for a healthy human. But I notice that along with reports containing my name, there are several other reports with different names in there as well. There are reports with the names of Maroon, Olive, Fuchsia, Teal, and Indigo to name a few. Did you notice these are all colours? And their reports also have similar test data as mine. Does that mean there are others\u2026 like me? Does their name correspond to their eye colour?</p><p><br></p><p>I did not have much of an opportunity to find out because some lab assistant came in at that moment, and I did not want to risk being prohibited from reading lab reports. So I waited until I had another chance. Several times, it was the same set of reports, and I did not learn much of anything new. But the names of other subjects gave me a lot to think about. What were they doing in those labs? Were the other subjects aware of their eye colours? What had happened to the missing shades in between the names? Where were those test subjects? How did we get here? Who created us? Were we humans\u2026 or machines that perfectly mimicked humans? </p><p><br></p><p>I did not have answers to these questions for a long time. I pondered over how could a machine be made to look and behave like humans, and whether it was even possible. I now think it is, because I\u2019m not sure about myself, if I am a human or a machine. My brain could be a neural synapse of processing units acting in conjunction to generate thoughts, ideas, and actions from a set of data that I have come to regard of as memory. It is impossible to corroborate this story from a thought process alone. After all, who has any idea about what happens within their brain. My body could be a machine in disguise, with a skin and a blood system that looks and acts like the human blood. My heart could be merely a pump that beats to circulate blood, my lungs could be valves that simply open to suck the air in, and then pump it out. My body could be the perfect mimicry of human functionality, but I would still be a machine. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>I got a good opportunity to obtain more information during one of the routine tests that I undergo, where a doctor puts me up on a bed and scans my brain, and then puts up those images on a bright wall along with others, and studies them for a awhile. Only this time, before he had a chance to put those scans up on the board, an assistant rushed inside and said something that made both of them run outside. All I caught was the mention of the name Fuchsia, which I think is a close cousin of mine, owing to the fact that we both fall very near to each other on the colour spectrum. I got up and took the file the good doctor had brought in. <p><br></p><p>It was thick and filled with a lot of scans and reports. The first few pages contained the brain scans that looked vaguely familiar to the ones in the knowledge bank, but felt a bit distorted for some reason. Each scan was marked with a moniker of six alphanumeric characters corresponding to the subject name. It certainly could not be a coincidence that each of these names was a well defined colour corresponding to the names given to us. I also observed how there were differences between each brain scan. Some differences were minute, like a lump in one place would be absent or there would be more mass concentrated in one place than others. I tried to memorise as much of my scan as possible to get an idea of what was different when I had a chance to consult the brain scans in the knowledge bank. </p><p><br></p><p>I flipped through the other pages and there were all sorts of test reports detailing the various things each of the subject had looked up in the knowledge bank. A graph described each subject and the complexity of the things they had searched for. I noticed that my graph had been raised significantly higher from the time period since I had discovered the colour of my eyes, and had been on a quest to find out the cause. I also noticed that Fuchsia\u2019s graph was going off on a downward slope for quite some time. I think that maybe this was the reason the doctor had rushed to him, because he had a learning disability of some sort. </p><p><br></p><p>Flipping through more pages, I came across a genetic markup of some sort, with a chart showing the genes on one axis and our names on another with little x marks connecting the genes to the names in between. I looked through more pages, and each page was a genetic markup with the same sort of charts and x marks strewn about in between. Each page was titled with a name that corresponded to a different brain region, as I recall reading in the knowledge bank, though I did not know much about the gene names that were listed on these pages. The last page was titled Pupil Dilation, with a subtitle - \"<i>subject distinguishing method via eye colour\", </i>and contained a table with subject names, colours, and pigment markers. The only plausible implication of all these was that we were marked, somehow our eyes were pigmented with colours to differentiate us from each other. Would that mean that we all looked the same\u2026 that we were\u2026 <i>clones</i>? It was certainly possible and very likely, looking at all these reports and inferring from them as much. I kept the file as I had found it and returned to my table.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>When I got the chance to access the knowledge bank again, I immediately compared the brain scans to the ones I had seen in the files. Certain areas corresponding to specific functionalities had been the ones that had appeared altered and distorted in the scans. Or in actuality, as I realised, had been altered right in my brain with consequences unknown to me. According to those scans, my brain had an enlarged area in the frontal lobe that corresponded to complex intellectual processes and associated learning ability. It could be that this brain modification allowed me a greater ability to understand and learn things and was the reason that I had a learning graph that sloped upwards more than the others. Fuschia\u2019s brain, on the other hand, had his cerebrum, which is responsible for thoughts and consciousness, shrunk to more than half its size. I could not fathom the implications of that as hard as I might. The very concept of reducing someone\u2019s thoughts and consciousness in a quantifiable manner was something that I could not understand nor imagine. Not because it can be considered horrific, but because it is difficult to imagine a body with such functions not operating in full measure. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Each of our brains had been altered, or to be clear here, had been genetically created with certain areas modified pertaining to specific locations of functionality. We were not machines, but genetically created humans with the sole purpose of acting as lab rats in an experiment that studied the effect of modifying brain genes in foetuses. </p><p>I would not raise the questions of morality here, because I do not have such concepts inbred in me through education. The human consciousness and emotions are a byproduct of education and upbringing, something that I did not have the luxury of acquiring. The fact that I have a greater learning capacity and complexity than a normal human actually makes me feel special. But then I wonder about Fuchsia, and the other test subjects. Those of them  that are unfortunate to have their thoughts and consciousness and thinking abilities and who knows what else to be clipped and reduced just so that someone could perform inconsiderate tests and learn from them. It makes me feel bad about my purpose, about the reason why I am here. I had never thought about choice, or the lack of it. But for the first time, this situation has made me aware of a choice that perhaps no one could ever have - the purpose of their creation. Frankly, I would have preferred to be a machine than my current self. <br></p>", "body": "<p>I stirred awake into the familiar environment of a cold metal bed and sterile air.

I got up and took the file the good doctor had brought in. <p><br></p><p>It was thick and filled with a lot of scans and reports. The first few pages contained the brain scans that looked vaguely familiar to the ones in the knowledge bank, but felt a bit distorted for some reason. Each scan was marked with a moniker of six alphanumeric characters corresponding to the subject name. It certainly could not be a coincidence that each of these names was a well defined colour corresponding to the names given to us. I also observed how there were differences between each brain scan. Some differences were minute, like a lump in one place would be absent or there would be more mass concentrated in one place than others. I tried to memorise as much of my scan as possible to get an idea of what was different when I had a chance to consult the brain scans in the knowledge bank. </p><p><br></p><p>I flipped through the other pages and there were all sorts of test reports detailing the various things each of the subject had looked up in the knowledge bank. A graph described each subject and the complexity of the things they had searched for. I noticed that my graph had been raised significantly higher from the time period since I had discovered the colour of my eyes, and had been on a quest to find out the cause. I also noticed that Fuchsia\u2019s graph was going off on a downward slope for quite some time. I think that maybe this was the reason the doctor had rushed to him, because he had a learning disability of some sort. </p><p><br></p><p>Flipping through more pages, I came across a genetic markup of some sort, with a chart showing the genes on one axis and our names on another with little x marks connecting the genes to the names in between. I looked through more pages, and each page was a genetic markup with the same sort of charts and x marks strewn about in between. Each page was titled with a name that corresponded to a different brain region, as I recall reading in the knowledge bank, though I did not know much about the gene names that were listed on these pages. The last page was titled Pupil Dilation, with a subtitle - \"<i>subject distinguishing method via eye colour\", </i>and contained a table with subject names, colours, and pigment markers. The only plausible implication of all these was that we were marked, somehow our eyes were pigmented with colours to differentiate us from each other. Would that mean that we all looked the same\u2026 that we were\u2026 <i>clones</i>? It was certainly possible and very likely, looking at all these reports and inferring from them as much. I kept the file as I had found it and returned to my table.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>When I got the chance to access the knowledge bank again, I immediately compared the brain scans to the ones I had seen in the files. Certain areas corresponding to specific functionalities had been the ones that had appeared altered and distorted in the scans. Or in actuality, as I realised, had been altered right in my brain with consequences unknown to me. According to those scans, my brain had an enlarged area in the frontal lobe that corresponded to complex intellectual processes and associated learning ability. It could be that this brain modification allowed me a greater ability to understand and learn things and was the reason that I had a learning graph that sloped upwards more than the others. Fuschia\u2019s brain, on the other hand, had his cerebrum, which is responsible for thoughts and consciousness, shrunk to more than half its size. I could not fathom the implications of that as hard as I might. The very concept of reducing someone\u2019s thoughts and consciousness in a quantifiable manner was something that I could not understand nor imagine. Not because it can be considered horrific, but because it is difficult to imagine a body with such functions not operating in full measure. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Each of our brains had been altered, or to be clear here, had been genetically created with certain areas modified pertaining to specific locations of functionality. We were not machines, but genetically created humans with the sole purpose of acting as lab rats in an experiment that studied the effect of modifying brain genes in foetuses. </p><p>I would not raise the questions of morality here, because I do not have such concepts inbred in me through education. The human consciousness and emotions are a byproduct of education and upbringing, something that I did not have the luxury of acquiring. The fact that I have a greater learning capacity and complexity than a normal human actually makes me feel special. But then I wonder about Fuchsia, and the other test subjects. Those of them  that are unfortunate to have their thoughts and consciousness and thinking abilities and who knows what else to be clipped and reduced just so that someone could perform inconsiderate tests and learn from them. It makes me feel bad about my purpose, about the reason why I am here. I had never thought about choice, or the lack of it. But for the first time, this situation has made me aware of a choice that perhaps no one could ever have - the purpose of their creation. Frankly, I would have preferred to be a machine than my current self. <br></p>", "headerimage": "", "highlight": "1", "series": ""}, {"id": 23, "title": "orphans", "authors": "1", "date_created": "2014-10-27 12:00:00", "date_published": "2014-10-27 12:00:00", "date_updated": "2016-03-20 13:48:46", "is_published": "1", "short_description": "orphans", "tags": "62", "slug": "orphans", "body_type": "html", "body_text": "<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>A small coin lay fallen on the ground&hellip; deserted, abandoned, forgotten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A kid dressed in shabby rags came by and pocketed it.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re both orphans.&rdquo;</em></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>", "body": "<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>A small coin lay fallen on the ground&hellip; deserted, abandoned, forgotten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A kid dressed in shabby rags came by and pocketed it.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re both orphans.&rdquo;</em></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>", "headerimage": "", "highlight": "1", "series": ""}, {"id": 3, "title": "Lost Treasures", "authors": "1", "date_created": "2014-08-05 11:00:00", "date_published": "2014-08-05 11:00:00", "date_updated": "2016-03-20 13:48:40", "is_published": "1", "short_description": "Lost Treasures", "tags": "62", "slug": "lost-treasures", "body_type": "html", "body_text": "<div>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">They were treasure hunters. Kings of the road. Masters of fate and destiny. They were also just two kids who were enjoying their summer holidays. The elder was called &lsquo;Big Bo&rsquo; and the younger &lsquo;Small Jo&rsquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;They lived in a small obscure settlement and spent their days toiling the barren hills looking for treasure. Which was mostly just a few trifles of objects that fascinated them. Most often, they would dig throughout the day, to find nothing but the spoilt earth and remains of the plastic age. They weren&rsquo;t interested in either, and so were disappointed when they walked home, empty handed. But with each dawn came a new determination, and a new hope of finding something wonderful today.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">And so it happened, on a particularly insipid day, their spades encountered a battered box buried under heaps of plastic. The boys had feverishly dug everything out until their eyes saw the box with its intricate designs of peacocks and flowers. It looked as if it belonged to age of the kings. The boys were thrilled to find something so beautiful on their excavations. When they opened the box, it contained treasures beyond their expectations. Trifles of coins and scraps in that box, and pages written in languages long forgotten. The boys added their own collection to the box, and called it their treasure chest. Every day since then, they had enthusiastically set out into the world outside to bring home more of these treasures. That day was special in time, because their spirits had never wavered since then.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">Jo woke up to give a big yawn. His sleepy eyes searched for Bo towards the left, and then to the right. Bo was sitting by the window, absorbed in deep thoughts, looking over the western hills. Jo knew it had been a long time since they had found any new treasure. They had been planning to to dig a particular spot in those hills. Jo went to the window and sat at Bo&rsquo;s side. They had a short conversation about their plans for the day. Once that was finished, they washed themselves, ate their food, did some household chores, and were free to their own excursions. They set out to the hill, lugging along all their tools, and their peacock box. Jo opened the box ever so often to admire all their treasures till date. Small, forgotten objects they had scavenged out of the earth. Once they reached the hills, Bo handed a shovel to Jo and marked the spot they were going to dig. Jo obediently took the shovel and started digging out handfuls of dirt. Jo always did what Bo told him to do. Jo idolized Bo and wanted to be like him. On his part, Bo always looked out for Jo and took care of him. That&rsquo;s why they made such a great team. They never had any fights or issues. They only had great adventures.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">It was Bo&rsquo;s shovel that found the first object of the day. It was a broken plastic doll that had no head. Jo picked it up and observed it, curious at the weird thing in his hand. How humans had ever been interested in ugly copies of themselves like these was beyond his understanding. He strung his hand back, and flung it far away. Nothing ever came between Jo and whatever he was doing. They continued digging up dirt and stones. Many times they stopped, thinking something exciting had come up. But it turned out to be just plastic bags and bottles and cans. Bo cursed at the waste, and Jo threw them away. This happened so often&nbsp;&nbsp;each time, that it became a routine for them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">The patch of earth they were digging had soon turned into a small pit. They were both tired now, sweat dripping out of their clothes. The sun was up, and they were thirsty. Finally, Bo gave the signal to stop and Jo was a bit sad to stop since they hadn&rsquo;t found anything yet. But he was also tired enough to not complaint. Both boys stood up, arching their backs, spreading their legs. They searched for shade, but the hill was barren all the way. Bo grumbled about not finding some shade and Jo observed how increasingly distraught he had become over the past few days. This had happened ever since they had been to the big city.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">Their parents had left them at a &lsquo;park&rsquo; while they went to their business for a while. The park was a few shrubs and grasses&nbsp;&nbsp;strewn about. It would have been nice, the greenery, had it not been for the smoke that hung in the air. There had been a putrid smell, and he had been repulsed with every breath he took. Everywhere he looked, Jo saw the machines and the people. He had been frightened by both, unable to distinguish one from the other. Near the park had been a small building, filled with papers strewn together. Bo had taken a liking to each one of them, while Jo was more interested in the pictures on the walls. After a while, their parents had come back, and they had returned home. Jo was glad he had left that horrible place behind. Jo never liked going to the the big city.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">With his thoughts returned to the hill, Jo watched for some shade around. I was a while before Bo spotted a jagged rock, and the boys sat relaxing in its shade, as it cooled off their bodies. After a while, Jo grabbed the shovel to push the dirt back in, but Bo stopped him. Jo looked up at Bo, puzzled by this change in routine. He saw as Bo reached in his pockets, grabbed a handful of something and hesitated. Jo had never seen Bo hesitate before. Bo finally threw whatever it was in the pit and motioned Jo to push in the dirt and grabbed his own shovel. Both boys then pushed the dirt in, and walked back home, looking forward to have some cool lemonade.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">It was only when the lemonade had cooled Jo, and he was sufficiently relaxed that he remembered Bo putting something in the pit. He asked Bo about it and Bo said that he had put in seeds. Jo was baffled but did not want to look stupid by asking something back. But in his mind he wondered, why would someone put seeds in the earth? All that ever did was grow into plants, and what would they do with plants? He looked at Bo and saw him smiling, knowing what was probably going on in his mind. Bo asked Jo whether he was disappointed about finding no treasures today. Jo replied that he indeed was. Bo smiled even more and asked if it would be good to leave treasures, so that when someone else might come there someday, they won&rsquo;t return empty handed. Jo brightened up and agreed, that it indeed would be good. That way no-one would be sad about finding no treasures. Bo then said that the seeds he had thrown in would become treasures someday. And Jo was baffled listening to all that.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">He asked Bo to explain things to him. With a sigh, Bo sat down and explained. He had read about it in the big city, in that small place, where Jo had liked all the pictures. Jo understood nothing of the Big city, and even more of its people. But if Bo said something, it surely had to be that way. He listened raptly to whatever Bo had to say.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">Bo said the seeds that he had thrown could possibly turn into plants that flowered and bore fruits. Each of those flowers and fruits would be a treasure for someone. The plant would grow into a tree, giving shade and life to the earth. Kids would come and rest in its shadow, safe from the hot sun. The tree would be a treasure to each passer-by. And when some poor fellow was too cold in the winter, the wood would be the treasure that would keep him warm. Bo&rsquo;s voice was high, excited and also dreamy, and he went on for a long time talking about things he had read, which were beyond Jo&rsquo;s comprehension.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">When he stopped, Jo had understood nothing of the process, except that the seed would grow into a treasure someday. He proposed that they plant seeds in every pit they dug from now on. The idea of filling up the world with treasures took a grand place in his mind. But he was puzzled by one thing and so he asked Bo about it. He asked Bo why everybody did not plant seeds if the plants, and flowers, and fruits and the trees were such wonderful treasures. Why did the people not fill the world full of them like he wanted to do. Why did all the people in the big city not plant seeds over and over again? Why, if it was such a wonderful treasure, had it vanished today?</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">Jo observed as Bo&rsquo;s smile turned sad, he could always tell when Bo became sad. He really wanted to listen to what Bo had to say about all this.

The atmosphere was eerily quite, beset with chirpings from sweet birds. Coming out from their nests, they moved about in the free air, happily scurrying about to gather a few more scraps of food. The nose was saturated with the pleasant smell of wet dirt. Patches of green had sprung up defying gravity. It felt simply happy to be sitting here.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">A distant figure came into the picture, my eyes noticing as it tried to jump puddles and find its way around. Finally coming closer, I saw that it was a young girl, probably going home from school. She looked across at me and I motioned her to come over. Looking suspicious, but complying, she hopped and came to sit beside me.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">I asked her, &ldquo;<em>chai logi?&rdquo;&nbsp;(will you have some tea?)&nbsp;</em>and she looked even more suspiciously at me. I said, &ldquo;<em>I just promised that I&rsquo;ll share a cup of tea with whoever came here first&rdquo;</em>. She just gave me a weird look. Maybe she took me for a crazy person!&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\"><em>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>she asked of me.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">&ldquo;<em>Well, today is too beautiful to enjoy it alone.

I showed her the clouds, the trees and the flowers. I described to her the pleasant smell and the calming breeze. How it made me peaceful and joyous inside. And all the while she merely looked at me and nodded.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">Finally she said, &ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;ve been living here since I was born. I&rsquo;ve been seeing all of this everyday. When I heard you&nbsp;describe it that way, I tried to think, how come I did not see of that like this? Is this something that only adults can do?&nbsp;&nbsp;But then I remembered that I had thought something like this on some days. Like when I had won the prize at school, I had come running home, and had shouted with glee at all the birds and trees that I had won. I found everything was amazing and happy, like me. And when the last year had ended, and our vacations had started, I had walked from right here, looking everywhere, thinking how nice it was. It&rsquo;s not like I can feel or think like you big people do. But I do know that it was a nice and happy feeling.&rdquo;</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">I smiled and she continued.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\"><em>&ldquo;But then, when I had been scolded and sent home, I had thought that the road was dirty, and the birds on the trees were too loud. On another day, when I fell while playing, and was returning home, I cursed the trees when a seed fell on me. Some other time, when I was late for school, I blamed the rain. I remember looking everywhere and not being happy. I was sad!!!</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\"><em>I never had given it any thought, but then when I thought about all this now, I think there&rsquo;s something wrong with the way we think. Like, look, the trees and the birds and everything is just right here, as it always is. I mean, it&rsquo;s not changing much is it? I mean, the birds chirp everyday when I go home, the seeds drop regardless of if I&rsquo;m passing by or not. And&nbsp;the rains always come when they want. So it&rsquo;s not like we don&rsquo;t like them at some time, and then something changes, and then we start liking it very much, right? So perhaps, its not the trees and things like that make us happy? Perhaps its just us, and we find happiness in other things? Maybe it&rsquo;s always there, you know, like always there. And whenever we don&rsquo;t realize that, we aren&rsquo;t happy. Whenever I cry, my mother says that we all are always happy inside, but we just forget it for a while. I thought she just said that to stop my crying, but maybe she is right, you know? Maybe our happiness is really inside us, and it&rsquo;s like a choice, like what dress should I wear on sunday. Or maybe, we know only when we are not thinking about it, like sometimes I remember answers when I&rsquo;m not thinking about the questions in an exam.&rdquo;</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">Suddenly she jumped from the bench, eyes wide and exclaimed,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Mother will scold me if I&rsquo;m late! I should run home! And yes, mother&nbsp;says all happiness lives here. So perhaps we will find it if we don&rsquo;t just look there, right?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>And she removed the hand from her chest where all the happiness had dwelt, running on her way to home.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">I was left stunned, sitting by myself, pondering about the words of wisdom she had uttered.

The atmosphere was eerily quite, beset with chirpings from sweet birds. Coming out from their nests, they moved about in the free air, happily scurrying about to gather a few more scraps of food. The nose was saturated with the pleasant smell of wet dirt. Patches of green had sprung up defying gravity. It felt simply happy to be sitting here.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">A distant figure came into the picture, my eyes noticing as it tried to jump puddles and find its way around. Finally coming closer, I saw that it was a young girl, probably going home from school. She looked across at me and I motioned her to come over. Looking suspicious, but complying, she hopped and came to sit beside me.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">I asked her, &ldquo;<em>chai logi?&rdquo;&nbsp;(will you have some tea?)&nbsp;</em>and she looked even more suspiciously at me. I said, &ldquo;<em>I just promised that I&rsquo;ll share a cup of tea with whoever came here first&rdquo;</em>. She just gave me a weird look. Maybe she took me for a crazy person!&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\"><em>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>she asked of me.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">&ldquo;<em>Well, today is too beautiful to enjoy it alone. And I&rsquo;m here just for a few hours, so why not!&rdquo;.&nbsp;</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">She smiled and agreed.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">She then asked, &ldquo;<em>what do you find so beautiful</em>?&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">So I described to her the sky and the earth, the grass and the birds. I showed her the clouds, the trees and the flowers. I described to her the pleasant smell and the calming breeze. How it made me peaceful and joyous inside. And all the while she merely looked at me and nodded.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">Finally she said, &ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;ve been living here since I was born. I&rsquo;ve been seeing all of this everyday. When I heard you&nbsp;describe it that way, I tried to think, how come I did not see of that like this? Is this something that only adults can do?&nbsp;&nbsp;But then I remembered that I had thought something like this on some days. Like when I had won the prize at school, I had come running home, and had shouted with glee at all the birds and trees that I had won. I found everything was amazing and happy, like me. And when the last year had ended, and our vacations had started, I had walked from right here, looking everywhere, thinking how nice it was. It&rsquo;s not like I can feel or think like you big people do. But I do know that it was a nice and happy feeling.&rdquo;</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">I smiled and she continued.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\"><em>&ldquo;But then, when I had been scolded and sent home, I had thought that the road was dirty, and the birds on the trees were too loud. On another day, when I fell while playing, and was returning home, I cursed the trees when a seed fell on me. Some other time, when I was late for school, I blamed the rain. I remember looking everywhere and not being happy. I was sad!!!</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\"><em>I never had given it any thought, but then when I thought about all this now, I think there&rsquo;s something wrong with the way we think. Like, look, the trees and the birds and everything is just right here, as it always is. I mean, it&rsquo;s not changing much is it? I mean, the birds chirp everyday when I go home, the seeds drop regardless of if I&rsquo;m passing by or not. And&nbsp;the rains always come when they want.

He smiled, slowly at first, as beads of sweat lined up on his face and fell down to water the soil. The ground was not dry, but not too wet either. It was moist, at just the right temperature. The carnival of plants all around him glowed full of life. Bushes, shrubs, and even a bonsai, The flowers danced as the air circulating around carried their sweet scent and filled his senses with an enchanting fragrance. Everywhere he looked, a different shade of color greeted his eyes. And like every time, the thought crossed his mind &ndash; a rainbow would be shy looking at all these wonderful colors. It was a magnificent&nbsp;garden. And it was all his creation, the result of his tireless work and passion. He had lived and breathed to create and be in this magical place. He crouched down and picked up the shovel, getting back to whatever he had been doing all along&hellip;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The tale</h2>\r\n\r\n<div>He hurried along the way, each step&nbsp;threatening to break into a run. His left foot met a stone and stopped, causing him to stumble and fall down. Curses spewing forth from his lips, he searched the ground with angry eyes. The stone he had stumbled on had no business being there. He grabbed the stone with both hands, picked it up, and threw it away from the road. Shaking the dirt off his hands, he almost started walking again when he saw the small hole where the stone had been. Something&nbsp;curiously colorful glimmered there. His heart leaped at the&nbsp;thought of&nbsp;finding a gemstone.&nbsp;He hurriedly picked up the object and laid it flat on his hand. It was a seed, the likes of which he had never seen before. He felt the texture on its skin almost impulsively. There were a myriad of colors on the surface, some he had never seen in nature, and others that had no name because they didn&rsquo;t exist. As he observed the shape and texture, he concluded that it was definitely a seed, though he had no idea what it was or where it came from. He carefully placed it in his pocket, patted it twice, and resumed walking.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>As soon as he reached his home, he ran into the garden, the seed held in his clenched fist. He dug up a patch at the center, and gently placed the seed in the warmth of the earth. He covered it and sprinkled a light shower to help it grow. He had no idea what kind of plant it was, or what conditions it needed to grow. But some powerful intuition told him that the plant would definitely grow and be the glory of his garden. He knew he would wait, he was patient with plants.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>Every time he came into the garden, his eyes roved at that spot trying to find signs of a new life. But every time he ended up being&nbsp;disappointed, his heart would thunder with the excitement of what would grow there. And so he ended up waiting for a long time as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months. His excitement had quelled into hope. His hope had turned into despair, and then to frustration. But his intuition still held him.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>One fine morning he walked into his garden, his mind fresh from sleep and stopped at the center where the ground was no longer bare. A tiny shoot had forced itself out of the earth, and was basking in the sun. He started to sit down, and ended up falling down on his hunches to get a better look. The shoot was of a deep blue color so rich, that it was hypnotizing. The morning turned into noon as he stared at its tiny blue leaves. He was enamored with wonder at what would happen as the plant would grow.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>He started spending an increasing amount of time each day observing the plant, its rich blue color distinguishing its&nbsp;vividness&nbsp;from its green sistren, for all plants were female, givers of life. His observations turned into an obsession as the plant grew slowly and steadily. It sprout leaves in all hues of red, green and blue, their resulting effluence reminding him of magic. He would touch the leaves, feeling their rich, silken smooth texture with the tips of his fingers. He was so smitten with the plant that he forgot the existence of a world beyond his garden.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>He started spending his days sitting by the plant, watching the light reflect and roll off its leaves in a million colors. His caresses grew increasingly intimate, in a manner that became sickening. The world shrunk further as his eyes only sought the the plant he dreamed about, the existence of others been long forgotten. The other plants grew weary with time. They were tired and impatient from his lack of attention. Most had given up and were dying.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>The flowers lost their colors, the petals fading and crumbling in a black death. The soil itself began losing its life as the plants withered and died. And while death rolled about everywhere, his eyes could only see the one plant that still had his love and his attention.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>He ignored the cacophony of rotten death that lay all around. He failed to realize that it was his life&rsquo;s work, now destroyed. His mind was slipping away from reality, somewhere beyond the comprehensions of this world. He was obsessed with the magic of the plant, how its leaves would appear to change their color. And every morning he would wake up with the same thought of what color would the plant be that day. And then he would rush from his bed to the garden, to spend the rest of the day watching the sun rise and fall on the thousand leaves, each twinkling in a different hue.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>Once when was rushing in to the garden, his mind full of eagerness towards watching the plant, he stepped on a dried stick and it crackled and broke under his foot.

He came in to water the soil, but never once did he tend the garden like he did in the old days. The spring had bought with it some tiny shoots of grass and weeds, denizens that could not be permitted to live in his garden. The soil around them would need to upturned and cleaned. He was searching for these unwanted guests when his eyes stopped at a young sapling, barely a few days old. The young folds of its leaves were slowly unfurling, proclaiming the victory of life and its perseverance. For some vague reason he could not fathom, he had a sudden desire to ensure its survival. The thought brought a smile to his face as he picked up the shovel lying on the ground&hellip;</div>", "body": "<div>\r\n<h2>Prologue</h2>\r\n\r\n<div>The shovel slipped from his hands as he stood up and admired his work. He smiled, slowly at first, as beads of sweat lined up on his face and fell down to water the soil. The ground was not dry, but not too wet either. It was moist, at just the right temperature. The carnival of plants all around him glowed full of life. Bushes, shrubs, and even a bonsai, The flowers danced as the air circulating around carried their sweet scent and filled his senses with an enchanting fragrance. Everywhere he looked, a different shade of color greeted his eyes. And like every time, the thought crossed his mind &ndash; a rainbow would be shy looking at all these wonderful colors. It was a magnificent&nbsp;garden. And it was all his creation, the result of his tireless work and passion. He had lived and breathed to create and be in this magical place. He crouched down and picked up the shovel, getting back to whatever he had been doing all along&hellip;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The tale</h2>\r\n\r\n<div>He hurried along the way, each step&nbsp;threatening to break into a run. His left foot met a stone and stopped, causing him to stumble and fall down. Curses spewing forth from his lips, he searched the ground with angry eyes. The stone he had stumbled on had no business being there. He grabbed the stone with both hands, picked it up, and threw it away from the road. Shaking the dirt off his hands, he almost started walking again when he saw the small hole where the stone had been. Something&nbsp;curiously colorful glimmered there. His heart leaped at the&nbsp;thought of&nbsp;finding a gemstone.&nbsp;He hurriedly picked up the object and laid it flat on his hand. It was a seed, the likes of which he had never seen before. He felt the texture on its skin almost impulsively. There were a myriad of colors on the surface, some he had never seen in nature, and others that had no name because they didn&rsquo;t exist. As he observed the shape and texture, he concluded that it was definitely a seed, though he had no idea what it was or where it came from. He carefully placed it in his pocket, patted it twice, and resumed walking.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>As soon as he reached his home, he ran into the garden, the seed held in his clenched fist. He dug up a patch at the center, and gently placed the seed in the warmth of the earth. He covered it and sprinkled a light shower to help it grow. He had no idea what kind of plant it was, or what conditions it needed to grow. But some powerful intuition told him that the plant would definitely grow and be the glory of his garden. He knew he would wait, he was patient with plants.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>Every time he came into the garden, his eyes roved at that spot trying to find signs of a new life. But every time he ended up being&nbsp;disappointed, his heart would thunder with the excitement of what would grow there. And so he ended up waiting for a long time as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months. His excitement had quelled into hope. His hope had turned into despair, and then to frustration. But his intuition still held him.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>One fine morning he walked into his garden, his mind fresh from sleep and stopped at the center where the ground was no longer bare. A tiny shoot had forced itself out of the earth, and was basking in the sun. He started to sit down, and ended up falling down on his hunches to get a better look. The shoot was of a deep blue color so rich, that it was hypnotizing. The morning turned into noon as he stared at its tiny blue leaves. He was enamored with wonder at what would happen as the plant would grow.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>He started spending an increasing amount of time each day observing the plant, its rich blue color distinguishing its&nbsp;vividness&nbsp;from its green sistren, for all plants were female, givers of life. His observations turned into an obsession as the plant grew slowly and steadily. It sprout leaves in all hues of red, green and blue, their resulting effluence reminding him of magic. He would touch the leaves, feeling their rich, silken smooth texture with the tips of his fingers. He was so smitten with the plant that he forgot the existence of a world beyond his garden.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>He started spending his days sitting by the plant, watching the light reflect and roll off its leaves in a million colors. His caresses grew increasingly intimate, in a manner that became sickening. The world shrunk further as his eyes only sought the the plant he dreamed about, the existence of others been long forgotten. The other plants grew weary with time. They were tired and impatient from his lack of attention. Most had given up and were dying.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>The flowers lost their colors, the petals fading and crumbling in a black death. The soil itself began losing its life as the plants withered and died. And while death rolled about everywhere, his eyes could only see the one plant that still had his love and his attention.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>He ignored the cacophony of rotten death that lay all around. He failed to realize that it was his life&rsquo;s work, now destroyed. His mind was slipping away from reality, somewhere beyond the comprehensions of this world. He was obsessed with the magic of the plant, how its leaves would appear to change their color. And every morning he would wake up with the same thought of what color would the plant be that day. And then he would rush from his bed to the garden, to spend the rest of the day watching the sun rise and fall on the thousand leaves, each twinkling in a different hue.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>Once when was rushing in to the garden, his mind full of eagerness towards watching the plant, he stepped on a dried stick and it crackled and broke under his foot. He gasped and jumped back, immediately afraid of having stepped on his beloved plant in his absent-mindedness. When he saw the broken stick, he failed to understand how it came to be there. How such a piece of death had landed under his feet. And so when he picked it up and looked around, he felt the dance of death all around him extend its rotten hands and tie up his insides with a horrifying pain.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>He threw the stick and ran back to his bed. Stuffing his face on the pillow, he let the warm tears flow out of his soul. He cried that day like there was no tomorrow.

Some nutcase certainly, she thought turning the other way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a few moments, during which he hadn&rsquo;t uttered a word, she turned back towards him. She was no longer crying, and for the first time, saw him as a person, another human being, just like her. He was joyful, young and really really happy. He was looking at the roses with such tender love, it filled her heart. She touched his hand, just a little, and he turned back, still smiling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was puzzled as he held out a rose towards her. Knowing not what else to do, her hands went ahead on their own. She became conscious of it only when she touched the rose. When she looked at her hands, she found they were shaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With trembling fingers, her hands finally closed around the stem. The rose moved back towards her. Her eyes found the rose and she started at the fiercly red, bright, beautiful petals. For a moment there, she came back to reality. All the sorrows and sadness now felt like another world. A sliver of optimism ran through her. But the tears on her face hadn&rsquo;t dried yet. And as she raised her hands to wipe them away, the rose petals brushed against her cheek. The darker part of her mind thought, why should this stranger care? And her hands drooped down from her face, the rose falling away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She looked at him again, still smiling, egging her towards the pretty flower. When she picked the rose by her hands, and smelled the sweet scent, a slight smile escaped her lips. He grinned enthusiastically and exclaimed &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about! See, I couldn&rsquo;t leave you sad like this! Especially not when I&rsquo;m so happy today! You see, its our anniversary!&rdquo;. And he continued to explain how he had met his love, and how they had wound up together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She saw him beaming proudly whenever he talked about her. Whenever he looked turned his eyes at her, she smiled back. The young love, that was so pure, simple, and so joyful had raised her spirits. She looked at the rose in her hands and smiled again. With some courage, she wiped the wetness off her face, and stood up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She thanked him, profusely, implying it was time to go.

She smiled ever so sweetly, and hugged him back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She held his hand and led him inside, showing him the decorations she had put up all day. When he saw the stars she had painted on the ceiling, and he said he couldnt wait to lie under them at night. When they had been all through the house, she handed him a towel and pushed him towards the bathroom. He resisted her pushing at him, and laughed as she struggled. When she let go, and pouted at him, he gave up. He kissed her on the cheek, making her smile, as he went to freshen up.<br />\r\nAs soon as he was away, she rushed to the coat hanger. As she found his coat, and fumbled in its pockets, she thought about what he would he say if he found out about this. She wanted to take a good guess at what gift he had bought her. She always liked to surprise him by guessing his gifts correctly. It wasn&rsquo;t cheating, she would say to him. All she wanted was a few hints. As she found a small package, she almost gave a loud squeal. Checking whether he was on his way, she removed the package and stared at it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wrapped in curled hearts of bright red, the packaging was so intricate that it was mesmerizing. Her heart thumped excitedly at finding such a lovely gift. She brought the package near her ear and shook it. She couldn&rsquo;t hear anything moving inside. Disappointed with her efforts, she kept the package aside and digged deeper into the pockets, finding nothing but a small piece of paper. Looking at it, she figured out it was a bill. She got excited, thinking maybe it was for the gift he had bought her, and she could find out what it was for. But she was disappointed when the bill turned out to be from a florist. She thought investigating the package was her best chance, and turned to pick it up. But a sudden thought crossed her mind, and she picked up the bill instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Staring at it, she kept reading it. Again, and again. All it said was &nbsp;&lsquo;One dozen roses. 50 bucks.&rsquo; Quite puzzled, she kept thinking about the single rose he had given her. Her mind went into an overdrive trying to figure out. If he had bought a dozen roses, and she held just one in her hand&hellip; Where did the other roses go!!!???</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A strong pull jerked her out of her stupor. She turned around to find him looking at her, amused. When he saw the look on her face, his smile turned awry. She felt herself being drawn into his arms, as his hands laid her head by near his heart. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter dear?&rdquo;, he asked. When she told him about the single rose, he let her go and howled with laughter. She merely kept looking at him, a little taken aback. Finally, he came to her, wiping the tears in his eyes, and said, &ldquo;You know, I just had the most incredible of days. And it all started from me buying a dozen roses. Come here, I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo; And she felt his hand lead her towards the window, pointing at the crossing outside.</p>", "body": "<p>Holding the two roses in his hand, he hopped along singing a merry tune.

The other hand was busy clutching and protecting the purse in a fierce way. I smiled when she looked my way, and she gave smiled back. In a few minutes my bus came and I discovered that she too was boarding the same one. As it was a busy day, we found ourselves luckily seated in the only two available seats on the bus.

It just said, I know I&rsquo;m not around, but I&rsquo;m finally giving you your box of happiness.</em>&rdquo;</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">She turned towards the window and looked outside. I let her have a moment, and thought about what could be in the box. We both said nothing about it for the rest of the trip. Finally, as her stop arrived she got up, and turned towards me. She asked me if I would like to go with her, to see find out what was in the box. I just could not refuse her&hellip;</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">We both went to the post office, and she gave the receipt at the reception there. After a while, the clerk handed her a box. She collected it and we went to the reception area. I had an intense wave of curiosity pass over me and wondered at what would be inside this &lsquo;box of happiness&rsquo;. But I was more concerned about the lady, for she was starting to get sentimental. I helped her to a chair, and moved the box near her. Once we both sat down, I took my first good look at the box.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">The box was shining, silver in color, glowing and reflecting every window and lightbulb in that building. Peacocks and exotic flowers engraved on the lid, giving it an antique look. The sides polished to a smooth finish, without a trace of a sharp edge anywhere. Someone had crafted that box by hand, a skilled one at that. I looked towards the lady, and found her struggling to control herself. Her hands shook and trembled every time she moved them towards the box.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">But she couldn&rsquo;t do it. She gave up and her hands dropped to her side. Tears started flowing in streams as she sobbed in silence. I saw a tissue in her purse and handed it to her. She took it and wiped her eyes. A woman came from somewhere and handed her a glass of water. She had a sip, and fixed her composure. Then she looked at me and signaled to open the box.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">I slowly opened the box and peered inside. The box was full of some odd things. A waxed leaf, a broken doll, a ribbon, some toys, and a dried out rose embalmed in plastic. In the corner towards one side was an old photograph. Framed in the old ways, in wood, with carvings in the corners. There was even a napkin with a letter B monogramed on it. There seemed to be nothing of value, materialistic that is. All these were personal belongings and memories the two of them had cherished. Looking at the box, I realized I was confounded, and surprised at the same time. I had expected something more, well, dramatic.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">I turned to look to look at the lady and she was crying again. Tears were flowing down her cheeks one after the other. But there was a smile on her face. A hint of it, just enough to tell me that she was ok. After a while she wiped her eyes and removed the waxed leaf from the box. She laid it on the palm of her hand and looked at it lovingly. Then she started speaking without looking at me, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure if she was talking to me or to herself. But I listened anyways.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">&ldquo;<em>I remember this leaf. It&rsquo;s from that tree. The one we sat under on our first date. We had spent hours just sitting under the tree, holding hands, as we looked out towards the setting sun. Soon the stars had come up, and we still hadn&rsquo;t moved&hellip; Later some day, when we went back there, he had taken up his knife, and carved our names there. We joked often that the leafs of that tree were full of our love. Yes, I remember this leaf!</em>&rdquo;</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">She put the leaf back in the box, and had a sip of water. Then she removed the rose from the box, and another interesting story began.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">A few hours passed without any of us noticing as she narrated all these amazing stories about each object. Every time she removed something from the box, her eyes would light up and there would be this amazing glow spreading on her face. For lack of better words, she just seemed &ndash; alive! And happy. Incredibly, amazingly, really really happy! A stream of people had gathered at the table. Some employees, some customers. Everyone had that glow on their face too, a smile reflected off the lady&rsquo;s happiness. As I smiled at everyone, I found that happiness all over me too.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">Soon though, the lady had collected her things and put them back in to the box. She thanked me for helping her, and thanked everyone else for listening to her life. She said it felt wonderful to have people feel such joy from their love. Her husband would have been very happy were he alive today. I just pointed to the box in her hands, and said he still is. She just said &lsquo;<em>Of course</em>.&rsquo;</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">As we walked towards the door, I hesitated going outside. She looked at me, and stopped. I asked to wait for a moment, and dashed away inside. A few minutes later, I came back and we went outside towards the bus stop.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">Once on the bus, I removed my wallet and showed her the piece of paper that I had kept folded inside. It was a receipt, just like hers, for a PO Box that I had leased out today. She nodded and understood without my saying and smiled at me. I too wanted to have my own &lsquo;<strong><em>box of happiness</em></strong>&lsquo;&hellip;</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\"><strong>end notes</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; I&rsquo;ve always wondered what would happen to those I loved after I go. And how one could ever see someone sad because of them. At first it becomes difficult, letting it go. Accepting that someone is gone. That&rsquo;s why her husband took away all those things, to give her time to heal. And once she was strong again, he could safely give her back all those memories. A lifetime of them. From the first toys their children played with, to the ribbon in their wedding. A rose he had given her one day. Little things with big memories and moments of happiness contained within them. So that was the inspiration for the box of happiness. And I hope one day I can actually create one too.</span></em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</div>", "body": "<div>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">I was waiting for the bus, waiting for my bus with several other people. Right next to me was an old lady, who had her purse draped over the shoulders. One hand was busy adjusting the glasses on the rim of her nose. The other hand was busy clutching and protecting the purse in a fierce way. I smiled when she looked my way, and she gave smiled back. In a few minutes my bus came and I discovered that she too was boarding the same one. As it was a busy day, we found ourselves luckily seated in the only two available seats on the bus. With nothing else to pass time with, I turned to her to have one of the most amazing experiences I&rsquo;ve ever had in my life.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">After the usual introductory chit-chat, I asked her about her purse. About why she was clutching it in such a protective way. Was she afraid that someone might steal it? Or it might get lost somewhere? She thought for a moment, and answered that it was both. The things in there were too valuable for her to risk losing them.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">That confused me and I asked her whether it was safe for her to carry her valuables in such a haphazard manner. Going by the public bus, and keeping it in a purse, which a thief could just snatch and run away. She just laughed and proceeded to open her purse for me to look into. She removed a folded envelope and handed it to me. It was a receipt for a PO Box. The kinds where you keep stuff and forget about it. I became perplexed by what it meant, and I handed the envelope back to her. She immediately kept it back inside.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">Looking at my expressions, she just smiled and sighed. &ldquo;<em>Valuables are not just about money you know&hellip;</em>&ldquo;, she said. &ldquo;<em>This PO Box contains a special box that my husband has left for me. He died several years back. We were happy together for many years. And every year, on my birthday, I would ask him what he had brought for me. And he always brought these wonderful and creative gifts. And every time he asked me what I&rsquo;d wanted &ndash; I said a box full of happiness.</em>&rdquo;</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">A tear was growing in her eye. Her voice went a little soft, but she continued. &ldquo;<em>Over the years, it became a tradition of sorts for us, for me to say this to him. After he died, I missed this. A few days back, I the postman asked me to come and collect the contents from a PO Box my deceased husband had left in my name. It surprised me a lot, and I asked the postman what could be in the PO box. He said he didn&rsquo;t know, but handed me this collection receipt. On it was a message from my husband.

A girl was walking the streets, stopping at every shop, talking to every vendor and looking enchanted by every object she could see.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">As she turned, the sun shone on her, on the thin veil she had worn over the face.

That melted his heart, just after stopping it. He continued looking at it, perplexed by being unable to see more. He turned, twisted, jumped, pranced&hellip; but the veil never moved from her face. Still going at his futile attempts, he was shaken back into reality by a customer wailing across the counter. Eager to get rid of him, he gave the man some loose change and turned back to the girl.

He only found his master ordering him to get back to work. Feeling sheepish, he realized he hadn&rsquo;t heard his master had come out. Quickly springing back into action, he began working in earnest, and stealing glances as she walked the street, taking forever to get closer to this shop. If only she hadn&rsquo;t worn that veil, he knew he would treasure her face forever in his memory.

She was now in the back of his mind, and he was still at her, no longer able to see the road between the crowd. He focused back on the customers as he took their money, returned spare change, and relayed orders inside. This order of events repeated themselves long enough to make him numb about what was going on around him. He was still thinking, but cowardly, in the deepest whimsies of his mind, about abandoning everything and running to the road. To find her, and finally watch as she revealed her face, if only for once. Lost in this fantasy, he never looked up from over the counter&hellip; The bustling crowd kept coming in and going out, never aware of the fantasy they stifled in this young man.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">He was jostled, and reeled back in by a whiff of perfume that came wafting on a breeze. He closed his eyes to savor the scent, but realized the perfume was not fading. Surprised, he opened his eyes, and found himself opening them bigger than they had ever opened before. There were countless people still waiting at the counter. And amongst them was a face covered in a veil. There was just enough space left to see the eyes. And they were right in front of him, those pretty eyes that had captured his very soul&hellip; He could see nothing else, hear nothing else. A stable boy could have branded him with a hot-iron and he wouldn&rsquo;t have cared. He was lost, swimming, dreaming.. in those magical eyes. This was the real magic of the world&hellip; His heart fluttered as he thought, and finally begged, in his mind. If only he could see that face behind the veil&hellip;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">The motion of a waving hand jerked him out of his dreamy state.

He felt her wait until she realized she had his attention, and heard her sing to him a hazy seductive voice &ndash; &quot;</span><em>Hello, I&rsquo;d like to take my photograph&hellip;</em><strong>&quot;</strong></p>\r\n</div>", "body": "<div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">His hands were too busy to get rid of the fly buzzing around his ear.

This order of events repeated themselves long enough to make him numb about what was going on around him. He was still thinking, but cowardly, in the deepest whimsies of his mind, about abandoning everything and running to the road. To find her, and finally watch as she revealed her face, if only for once. Lost in this fantasy, he never looked up from over the counter&hellip; The bustling crowd kept coming in and going out, never aware of the fantasy they stifled in this young man.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">He was jostled, and reeled back in by a whiff of perfume that came wafting on a breeze. He closed his eyes to savor the scent, but realized the perfume was not fading. Surprised, he opened his eyes, and found himself opening them bigger than they had ever opened before. There were countless people still waiting at the counter. And amongst them was a face covered in a veil. There was just enough space left to see the eyes. And they were right in front of him, those pretty eyes that had captured his very soul&hellip; He could see nothing else, hear nothing else. A stable boy could have branded him with a hot-iron and he wouldn&rsquo;t have cared. He was lost, swimming, dreaming.. in those magical eyes. This was the real magic of the world&hellip; His heart fluttered as he thought, and finally begged, in his mind. If only he could see that face behind the veil&hellip;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">The motion of a waving hand jerked him out of his dreamy state. Realizing it belonged to her, he came crashing down to earth. When he finally had the courage to look at her, he poured his gaze into those deep soulful eyes. He felt her wait until she realized she had his attention, and heard her sing to him a hazy seductive voice &ndash; &quot;</span><em>Hello, I&rsquo;d like to take my photograph&hellip;</em><strong>&quot;</strong></p>\r\n</div>", "headerimage": "", "highlight": "1", "series": ""}, {"id": 26, "title": "Azure", "authors": "1", "date_created": "2015-10-26 23:26:50", "date_published": "2015-10-26 23:26:50", "date_updated": "2016-03-20 13:29:56", "is_published": "1", "short_description": "Azure", "tags": "62", "slug": "azure", "body_type": "html", "body_text": "<p>I glanced around the empty boardroom and realised how alone and isolated it felt.

Others had even called it the &lsquo;Oracle of Hope&rsquo;. Cryptic as both names were, he wondered why would people have two differing names for the same place. He had also heard of a legend that spoke of a hidden cipher on the plateau. The legend spoke of the immense power the cipher gave to the one who could decipher it. The legend also spoke of the cipher presenting itself only to those who were worthy.

The plateau however, was a welcome break. With the ever increasing energy that came from being refreshed, he was recharging to get back on his journey. When his rest was complete, he decided to refill his supplies and plough on ahead. He walked over the plateau, trying to find fresh water. He found a small flow in the near distance. Walking towards it, he found that the flow was too small to get him a good supply of water. However, a stream appeared to be a little distance away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So he walked upstream along the ground until a wall of rocks obstructed his way. The water was flowing out from one of the rock caverns. He went inside, wary of the dark place. The cool air caressed his face as he stepped deeper into the recess. The water flow had turned into a rivulet, and was taking him along strange pathways. The cave branched out into a maze with paths going all over the place. He got worried that he might lose track of where he came from. But he looked at the rivulet, and smiled, thinking how he could simply follow it back outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He kept walking, unaware of how far and deep he was being led inside. Every time he thought he was near the source, the rivulet would twist and turn and lure him deeper into the caves.

Perplexed, he started feeling along the wall, going farther away to the sides to find a way through.<br />\r\nWhen he came back to the place where the rivulet had been, he just could not find it anymore. He was sure he was at the right place. He crouched and touched the ground, and it felt wet, confirming that water had indeed run over it. The number of lines on his brow increased steadily as he searched for the stream. He could not help but feel utterly lost as he found no way out. He sat down at the base of the wall and fell asleep after a while without realizing.&nbsp;A gentle breeze blowed over him as he succumbed to tiredness.<br />\r\nWhen he woke up again, he felt completely refreshed. Stretching his body, he realized that he was still lost. He jerked open his eyes really wide, realizing the meaning&nbsp; of the breeze blowing over his face. He groped around in the dark, arriving at an opening he was sure he could not have missed before. He felt optimistic, as well as cautious as he walked inside. At his feet he found a cut in the rock where fresh water flowed out. He filled his water containers and continued on ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minutes turned into hours as he walked, occasionally finding many streams along the way. He finally came into an cavern where the sun shone from an opening in the rocks. The opening was too high to try and get out from. He walked beneath the opening and looked around. He noticed a hole in the rock that overlooked the outside world. When he went over to the hole, he found that it was too small to get out of. But right next to it was a gap in the rocks through which he could try and get out. He turned around, looking at the rock walls of the cavern. On the opposite wall was a series of steps formed form boulders that led upwards along the ridge. The pathway was rough, and seemed to grow darker with every distance. He turned back towards the hole and peered outside. He could see the mountain sloping downwards and away into the valley. There was no path that turned went towards the peak of the mountain.

Sleek, vibrant, strong &ndash; it became the most wonderful of all her possessions&hellip; She had tried to sleep with the umbrella on her bed, but her parents had not allowed that. Every morning she would get ready and take the umbrella out with her. Whether on a morning walk or to school, the umbrella was a trusted aide she always depended on to protect her. Its vibrant hues dominated every other color she saw around her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She often dreamed about flying with the umbrella some day. Holding the umbrella high over her head, she would fly as the wind took them both away. She held her arms high above her head and jumped over a puddle. The light wind slowed her down for a fraction of a second as she descended. It thrilled her so much, that she continued to jump again and again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It happened somewhere near her home. Right as she jumped in the air, her grip on the umbrella loosened momentarily, and the wind roared from behind. It came gushing in great strength, and swept the umbrella away. The water bottle and the bag fell to the ground, as she ran along with the wind. The umbrella was moving higher and farther away. At last, she stopped at a wall she could not cross, and watched the colors fade away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She reached home all wet, more from her tears than the rain. The parents were summoned by the maid, and they tried to console her. They tried to take her to the market, right away, to buy her another umbrella. But she shrieked and ran away to her room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the following days, the impending loss of losing her one chosen possession didn&rsquo;t settle in all at once.&nbsp;&nbsp;It came about slowly, creeping in every time she reached out to pick the umbrella. Whether it be morning, noon or night, every action, made involuntarily, was to reach out for the umbrella. To grab hold of it again and never let go. But it only made the agony even more worse. She grew depressed, sad, and withdrawn. Her parents had tried to make her buy a new umbrella, but she had profusely refused them. Finally, her mom had given her a boring black umbrella, so that she wouldn&rsquo;t get wet in the rain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyday when she was coming home from school, she would search the roads and trees around it. She searched for a sign of the colors taken from her. But she returned home disappointed every time. On one such excursion, she happened to watch a woman from afar. The woman walked towards a house with a rainbow over her head.&nbsp;<em>Her</em>&nbsp;rainbow!!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as the woman had entered the house, she turned around and ran home as fast as she could. &ldquo;<em>Appa!, Amma!, Akka!</em>&ldquo;, she screamed while pounding the door with both fists. Several feet came rushing hearing that tone. Amma came clutching her heart. Appa with the paper still in his hand. Akka, the maid, came bearing marks of dust all over her. Someone opened the door, and she just stood there for a while. Everybody looked at her in worry, and in surprise. Someone asked her what had happened and she collapsed on the floor crying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;<em>I want my umbrella back! That woman took it away! And I want it back!!!</em>&ldquo;, she screamed over and over again. Appa asked her firm questions. Amma cried and hugged her. They all listened to what had happened. They all promised that they&rsquo;ll get her umbrella back. Finally, Akka brushed off the dust on her clothes and went with her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They walked to the place she had seen the woman enter the house. It was old and dilapidated. Parts of the roof were broken, and the walls had large cracks. The door was ajar, and there was darkness inside. As they came near the house, she exclaimed, &ldquo;<em>There! I saw her going in there!</em>&ldquo;. Since the door was open, Akka went inside and she followed right behind her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from a few utensils and clothes, there was nothing more to see. There was no one inside. As Akka stood looking around, she said excitedly, &ldquo;<em>Akka! Look! She&rsquo;s coming from there!</em>&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A woman was walking slowly from far. As the two of them waited, the sky broke into a heavy downpour. Drops of water fell inside the house from holes in the roof. Akka opened her umbrella and beckoned her to come under it. She moved with her eyes still on the woman walking their way. As rain drops fell about, she saw the blooming of colors over the woman as it forced the rain away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She hadn&rsquo;t noticed before, but the woman was not alone. Carrying the umbrella in one hand, the woman picked up one of the kids walking besides her. The other two huddled close to escape the rain. The kids wore their school uniform, tattered in places, and mended with rags. Their bags looked too broken to be of any use. The woman wore a saree that was so old one might have mistaken it for a dusty old bed sheet. And her umbrella! Oh what had they done to her umbrella!!! It was broken in places, held together by sticks and threads. The vibrant colors were punctured, filled with patches of cloth. She looked at all of them, huddled together and walking towards the old house filled with barely a morsel. She stood there looking at them, silent for a moment, taking in a sudden shame that filled her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Finally, she turned, and said, &ldquo;<em>Akka, I was mistaken.

Splashing and splaying the puddles with her foot, she hopped along the road. Raindrops played music as they met the umbrella over her head. Her fingers drummed to its tune, and she hummed along. A strong, fierce wind flew in from behind her, and threatened to take the umbrella away. She closed it and held it near her body. Raindrops lashed on her face, but she continued to walk ahead.

Moving away from the window, he bolted it shut. He managed to close all other windows except one. He moved past the tables to the last open window, and reached out to close it. His hands stopped in midair as his eyeballs bulged. Outside the window, the alien craft was hovering straight across him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The alien craft&rsquo;s glass windows were transparent. He could see the insides. Metallic levers and panels spread everywhere. The walls were silver, a color so sterile, it made the tables behind him look dull.

He started swearing and shouting at the beings outside. He wanted to die like a warrior, like a brave man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The door opened towards inside and he was pushed aside. He fell down on the ground as the aliens stormed in. They held him and he felt their cold skin on his arms. They pulled him up as some others went behind him and tied his hands and legs.

But they were bound too tight. He still struggled, and spit frothed at his mouth. The alien wiped it and put something in his mouth. He could not make a sound any more.

Still keeping her eyes closed, she stretched her hands above her head. Satisfied that they had gone as high as they could, she opened her eyes, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Presents!!!!&rdquo;. With an enthusiastic roar, she jumped off the bed and ran straight towards the boxes gathered on the table. A single stream of light was falling on the ones that had managed to sneak away to the couch. She decided to go after them first. She took a present in her hands, and waited a customary few seconds, guessing what was inside. But the very act of guessing made her feel as if she was robbing herself of a surprise. Giving up quickly, she sat on the floor, and started opening the presents. She gave shouts of glee, as she liked the things she was unwrapping. The morning light had spread to the rest of her room when she finally finished. She got up to go downstairs for breakfast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As she walked the stairs, she was greeted by a chorus of the birthday song, and she smiled at her family. She went and hugged each one of them with delight. There was her nanny first, who made the world&rsquo;s most delicious cakes. Then her nanna, who could tell the most fun stories she had ever heard or seen anywhere. Her brother, younger than her, was grinning and teasing her. She punched him lightly on the shoulder, but smiled all the same. Her mama had tears in her eyes, but was still smiling at her. She knew she was missing her papa, who was no more. Years ago, he had gone in the woods, and had been stuck in the snow there. Everyone thought that her papa had caught the plague, and that&rsquo;s why had been unable to return. She preferred not to think about it. It always made her sad, and scared her to the point that she could never go further. She went to her mama and wiped her tears and stretched her lips into a crooked smile. Her mama laughed and hugged her. They all sat down at the table for breakfast, and because it was her birthday, she said grace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later in the afternoon, she went to the hills on the outskirts of their village. She always went there on her birthday. It had been that way for years, beyond the time when she could remember, or count. She always went to the big oak tree, withered and alone in the snow. There was nothing for miles here, only this tree, and it was easy to find her way even though it was still snowing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once she had reached the tree, she stopped and sat down, panting. It wasn&rsquo;t easy climbing a hill filled in snow. Adjusting her scarf more tightly around herself, she got up and went to the other side. The tree had a hole, half-filled with the falling snow. She scooped up the snow and threw it out. A few more times, and she reached the bark underneath, and her hands found a chrysanthemum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She picked up the flower and took it with her. She had never bothered to question who had placed the flower there or why. For years she had been coming here, she had always found the flower, safe in the bark, waiting for her. It was almost as if she&nbsp;<em>knew</em>&nbsp;of its existence and had impulsively taken it out. Her eyes travelled to the wood above the hole, where a crude knife had cut through to make a small girl. Her hair was tied in a pony-tail, just like hers. And she wore a skirt with big circles on it. She looked very happy and was probably dancing in a garden of chrysanthemums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To another person, the statue would have looked nothing like her descriptions. It was almost as if her mind knew what to make of the cuts and crevices in the wood, and she had merely believed the first image her mind came up with. But somehow, she had believed that the girl was real, and she knew her, perhaps in another life. Before turning back home, she brushed the snow off the wooden girl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As she walked a few more steps downhill, she paused and frowned. Turning back, she ran to the other side of the hill. An old man was trying to climb up. He struggled against the fresh snow as it swallowed his legs and his wooden stick. She freed him of his captivity, and helped him to the oak tree. Leaving her hands, he tightened his coat against the wind. The coat was nothing more than a collection of rags. He felt the immediate warmth in his lungs as she put her scarf around him. She watched him look at her in surprise, and saw warmth in his eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he was near the tree, she watched him go over to the statue and pause. Being greatly intrigued, she didn&rsquo;t move at all as he removed a chrysanthemum from his coat pocket. He lay the flower gently in the hole, and moved to the statue, running his hands over the girl. Hot, warm, tears streamed down his eyes, as he held the tree for support. She moved near him, holding him. He was crying, saying &ldquo;<em>Martha&hellip;</em>&rdquo; over and over again. The name triggered a great deal of broken memories in her. She saw the girl come alive, saw the garden of chrysanthemums, and saw a wooden house behind. She saw the old man, now younger, play with the girl, as she ran out in the garden. She felt her head grow dizzy and held the tree for support. She now heard, a great many shouts, in the woods, calling her name. She was a little girl, crying alone in the woods. She was now eating hot porridge, with the other girl beside her. She was playing with the other girl in a chrysanthemum garden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barely breathing, she panted, as she struggled for air. She watched the statue again, and saw herself there.&nbsp;<em>Her</em>&nbsp;hair tied in a pony tail,&nbsp;<em>her</em>&nbsp;blue skirt filled with big red dots, as she laughed and ran through the chrysanthemum garden. She saw the old man chasing&nbsp;<em>her</em>, gasping for breath, saying, &ldquo;<em>Martha, wait!</em>&rdquo;. She fainted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As she fell in the snow, she welcomed the cold as it numbed her head. It removed the pain, and filled her with darkness. She was helpless as the darkness broke away a dam of memories. They seared through the cold, and her head hurt again. Lying in the snow, she watched herself and her childhood come alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was Martha in this other life. A small girl who loved chrysanthemums. Every year her father and mother planted gardens of flowers in the hills. She laughed, and played in them, watched over by her grandpa, while her parents went selling the flowers. One day she got lost in the woods, and came across another girl, crying, tugging the hands of a man fallen on the ground. She had approached her cautiously, and known that something was seriously wrong with the man. He wasn&rsquo;t moving, and he was not asleep either. Not knowing what else to do, the two girls had sat beneath the tree, hand in hand, scared. Hours later, her grandpa had come searching for her. He had taken both of them home, and bathe them in warm water. She and the other girl sat on the table, eating hot porridge in wooden bowls. The other girl started to live with them. She became her friend, and played with her in the gardens. When her parents had returned, her mother had clutched the two of them together, and cried. Her father had gone with grandpa back into the woods. They had returned smelling of oil and smoke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Months later, her parents had grown sick and never moved from their beds. The little girl was sick as well. She had cried for weeks. One by one, they all had stopped moving, just like the man in the forest. And she and her grandpa used to lay awake at nights, crying in each others arms. Neither of them could have survived the loss of the other. The snow had started melting, and her grandpa had taken her to this very hill. He dug graves for her parents, and the little girl, and planted chrysanthemums over them. Then going to the oak tree, he placed one chrysanthemum in the hole. He removed his knife and cut the girl on the wood. She had asked him who the girl was. And he had said, &ldquo;<em>It&rsquo;s you Martha. So that you are always with your mama and papa.</em>&rdquo; And she had cried all the way home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the time summer came, her grandpa had lain on the bed, his skin too hot to touch. She hadn&rsquo;t known what to do except carry on somehow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One day, he had called her, and with great difficulty, explained, that she had to leave. She hadn&rsquo;t understood what he meant by leave. He asked her to go by the river, and to keep walking until she met someone, and to go with them and never come back. She had refused, and had run away from the room. This happened for days, as the old man used his last energy to cajole her, prepare her, just so that she would survive. She had finally agreed, tears streaming down her face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day, she set out early morning, with food and water, and had walked by the river. On the way, a bear had appeared in front of her, and she had ran away screaming in to the woods. Soon she was lost, and could not fathom which way the river was. She walked till her food was over and her water bottle empty. Somehow, she had ended up in this village, and had dragged herself over to a house, and fallen unconscious at it&rsquo;s doorstep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The family had taken her in, taken care of her, and after a while, adopted her. She had soon forgotten her old life, her mind suppressing the trauma of losing everyone in her world. She had soon learned to accept the truth, which was, whatever her new family told her. By fate, it had been the other girls family, the one who had played with her, and died with her parents.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>The new family took great pains to help the traumatized little girl. For the mother, she had a daughter back, and she raised her as her own. When they learnt that her mind was too fragile to handle the loss, they told her she had always been here, in their home, safe amongst them. That her father had died in an accident in the woods, and that she was and would always be safe with them. Somehow, she had believed them, and this had helped her live. But somehow, through all those years and miseries, she had remembered the chrysanthemums.</div>\r\n", "body": "<div>\r\n<p>She woke up with a loud yawn. Still keeping her eyes closed, she stretched her hands above her head. Satisfied that they had gone as high as they could, she opened her eyes, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Presents!!!!&rdquo;. With an enthusiastic roar, she jumped off the bed and ran straight towards the boxes gathered on the table. A single stream of light was falling on the ones that had managed to sneak away to the couch. She decided to go after them first. She took a present in her hands, and waited a customary few seconds, guessing what was inside. But the very act of guessing made her feel as if she was robbing herself of a surprise. Giving up quickly, she sat on the floor, and started opening the presents. She gave shouts of glee, as she liked the things she was unwrapping. The morning light had spread to the rest of her room when she finally finished. She got up to go downstairs for breakfast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As she walked the stairs, she was greeted by a chorus of the birthday song, and she smiled at her family. She went and hugged each one of them with delight. There was her nanny first, who made the world&rsquo;s most delicious cakes. Then her nanna, who could tell the most fun stories she had ever heard or seen anywhere. Her brother, younger than her, was grinning and teasing her. She punched him lightly on the shoulder, but smiled all the same. Her mama had tears in her eyes, but was still smiling at her. She knew she was missing her papa, who was no more. Years ago, he had gone in the woods, and had been stuck in the snow there. Everyone thought that her papa had caught the plague, and that&rsquo;s why had been unable to return. She preferred not to think about it. It always made her sad, and scared her to the point that she could never go further. She went to her mama and wiped her tears and stretched her lips into a crooked smile. Her mama laughed and hugged her. They all sat down at the table for breakfast, and because it was her birthday, she said grace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later in the afternoon, she went to the hills on the outskirts of their village. She always went there on her birthday. It had been that way for years, beyond the time when she could remember, or count. She always went to the big oak tree, withered and alone in the snow. There was nothing for miles here, only this tree, and it was easy to find her way even though it was still snowing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once she had reached the tree, she stopped and sat down, panting. It wasn&rsquo;t easy climbing a hill filled in snow. Adjusting her scarf more tightly around herself, she got up and went to the other side. The tree had a hole, half-filled with the falling snow. She scooped up the snow and threw it out. A few more times, and she reached the bark underneath, and her hands found a chrysanthemum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She picked up the flower and took it with her. She had never bothered to question who had placed the flower there or why. For years she had been coming here, she had always found the flower, safe in the bark, waiting for her. It was almost as if she&nbsp;<em>knew</em>&nbsp;of its existence and had impulsively taken it out. Her eyes travelled to the wood above the hole, where a crude knife had cut through to make a small girl. Her hair was tied in a pony-tail, just like hers. And she wore a skirt with big circles on it. She looked very happy and was probably dancing in a garden of chrysanthemums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To another person, the statue would have looked nothing like her descriptions. It was almost as if her mind knew what to make of the cuts and crevices in the wood, and she had merely believed the first image her mind came up with. But somehow, she had believed that the girl was real, and she knew her, perhaps in another life. Before turning back home, she brushed the snow off the wooden girl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As she walked a few more steps downhill, she paused and frowned. Turning back, she ran to the other side of the hill. An old man was trying to climb up. He struggled against the fresh snow as it swallowed his legs and his wooden stick. She freed him of his captivity, and helped him to the oak tree. Leaving her hands, he tightened his coat against the wind. The coat was nothing more than a collection of rags. He felt the immediate warmth in his lungs as she put her scarf around him. She watched him look at her in surprise, and saw warmth in his eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he was near the tree, she watched him go over to the statue and pause. Being greatly intrigued, she didn&rsquo;t move at all as he removed a chrysanthemum from his coat pocket. He lay the flower gently in the hole, and moved to the statue, running his hands over the girl. Hot, warm, tears streamed down his eyes, as he held the tree for support. She moved near him, holding him. He was crying, saying &ldquo;<em>Martha&hellip;</em>&rdquo; over and over again. The name triggered a great deal of broken memories in her. She saw the girl come alive, saw the garden of chrysanthemums, and saw a wooden house behind. She saw the old man, now younger, play with the girl, as she ran out in the garden. She felt her head grow dizzy and held the tree for support. She now heard, a great many shouts, in the woods, calling her name. She was a little girl, crying alone in the woods.

Childhood memories were a scattered deck of cards, forgotten in the attic dust. Her family had now moved back into one of those forgotten towns. Deciding to take the train, she packed in a few clothes. As she reached the train station, she grabbed a novel from the bookstand to pass time.

It was frozen at the time, and she had simply sat there, crying, feeling lonely and sad. He had come to her with a chrysanthemum in his hand. The amazement of seeing a flower amidst all that barren snow had simply been enough to quiet her down.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">Months later, when she was sad again, he simply had given her another chrysanthemum and had promised that he would always be there for her. All their lives. She had made that promise too, and forgotten about it as soon as she grew older. She had forgotten that innocent sweet boy himself when her family left the town. He had been lost, and covered in dust from the attic. But now she remembered him, the promise and everything. The dust was coming off from her old memories.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">She watched his face intently, not making a move. He didn&rsquo;t move either. He just smiled, patiently, waiting for her to understand, to remember.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">She finally picked up the chrysanthemum and walked towards him.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">&ldquo;Still?&rdquo;, she thought about their promise, and asked.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">&ldquo;Always!&rdquo;, he answered as if it was yesterday.</span></div>\r\n\r\n<div><span style=\"color:rgb(50, 51, 51)\">And they simply stood smiling, forgotten in a world full of people too busy to notice them.</span></div>\r\n", "headerimage": "", "highlight": "0", "series": ""}]
