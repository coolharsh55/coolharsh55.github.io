And the starting of why this book suddenly became very interesting. I have lost track of how many times I have read, heard, seen someone say that happiness can only come from <em>giving</em> as in helping others and not being selfish. It was endearing to see someone say that happiness comes from solving problems, without any footnote or attached note 5 pages after that tries to scope what was said. No. Problems are problems, be what they may, and solving them is a cause of happiness. This is not an universal truth, but more of a motto to strive towards living everyday. In this respect, I agree with the author. Yes, happiness does indeed come from solving problems. (see next quote)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To be happy we need something to solve.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This quote directly relates to the source of happiness. Does it mean to become happy, we must create problems? But these problems should not be the sort of problems which make us unhappy, correct? Therefore, these are problems which challenge us and uplift us and make us better. Then completing them or solving them or overcoming them would make us happy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is therefore a form of action; it\u2019s an activity, not something that is passively bestowed upon you, not something that you magically discover in a top-ten article on the Huffington Post or from any specific</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><u>Hypothesis:</u> happiness is an action, and not passive. Therefore, it cannot be a feeling.</p>\n<p>If this is true, then happiness does not happen on its own. It becomes more of a reaction rather than a feeling that happens on its own. And what would this reaction be to? As said, happiness comes from solving. This does not state that this is the only source of happiness. But that happiness comes from the this particular action.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We like the idea that there\u2019s some form of ultimate happiness that can be attained. We like the idea that we can alleviate all of our suffering permanently. We like the idea that we can feel fulfilled and satisfied with our lives forever. But we cannot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This directly tackles the myth of the eternal happiness. Perpetuated by pretty much every approach covering the religious or sprirtiual domain. Feeling happy all the time would mean not feeling happy at all. Happiness is 'good' only because it is a comparitive pleasure. If it happened all the time, would we really be happy all the time?</p>\n<p>This also means that chasing happiness all the time is unfulfilling and unsatisfying. And therefore, it would be worth the time and effort to work towards happiness and enjoy it at moments of success rather than strive to have as much of it as possible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The true measurement of self-worth is not how a person feels about her positive experiences, but rather how she feels about her negative experiences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a powerful quote. Everyone can deal with their positive experiences, but how the negative ones are handled decides how life is played out. The negative experiences are what shape life. The positive experiences are pleasures and do not contribute as much. This does not mean that one should seek out negative experiences to better themselves or to grow, but rather, one must have the mindset to overcome negative experiences, which is what their measure of self-worth, and thereby, their inner-strength becomes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>construing everything in life so as to make yourself out to be constantly victimized requires just as much selfishness as the opposite.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This addresses the mindset that is constantly trying to think what is going wrong in life, or how things are not going well with you, or how you are the victim, and everything is someone else's fault. This will only makes someone powerless, and even happy experiences turn into not happy ones. Therefore, it is a waste of time to wallow in self-pity and blame. Taking the advice from the first quote, turn it into a problem that you can solve (or overcome) and you will find happiness in it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It takes just as much energy and delusional self-aggrandizement to maintain the belief that one has insurmountable problems as that one has no problems at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is this a choice? Is the point here that since they both take the same amount of energy, we can choose what we want to put our energies into? Or is the point rather that both of them are energy sinks, and both are false, and therefore should not be our goals or habits?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Internet has not just open-sourced information; it has also open-sourced insecurity, self-doubt, and shame.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a brilliant quote. One that I can write an entire article about, and I am sure someone else has already written an article about. It relates how one can see all the 'good' and the 'positive' experiences everywhere but in their life and then see how our life is 'pale' by comparison, and therefore they produce their own unhappiness.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We\u2019re apes. We think we\u2019re all sophisticated with our toaster ovens and designer footwear, but we\u2019re just a bunch of finely ornamented apes. And because we are apes, we instinctually measure ourselves against others and vie for status. The question is not whether we evaluate ourselves against others; rather, the question is by what standard do we measure ourselves?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay. Saying we are apes does not mean I have a tail or a liking for bananas. Rather, it addresses the issue of how we are all driven by what are essentially animalistic tendencies. Take hunger for instance, a lot of times people are driven by the instinct of hunger.

Rather, there should be a healthy balance of both?</p>", "body": "> Happiness comes from solving problems.\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting quote. And the starting of why this book suddenly became very interesting. I have lost track of how many times I have read, heard, seen someone say that happiness can only come from *giving* as in helping others and not being selfish. It was endearing to see someone say that happiness comes from solving problems, without any footnote or attached note 5 pages after that tries to scope what was said. No. Problems are problems, be what they may, and solving them is a cause of happiness. This is not an universal truth, but more of a motto to strive towards living everyday. In this respect, I agree with the author. Yes, happiness does indeed come from solving problems. (see next quote)\r\n\r\n> To be happy we need something to solve.\r\n\r\nThis quote directly relates to the source of happiness. Does it mean to become happy, we must create problems? But these problems should not be the sort of problems which make us unhappy, correct? Therefore, these are problems which challenge us and uplift us and make us better. Then completing them or solving them or overcoming them would make us happy.\r\n\r\n> To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is therefore a form of action; it\u2019s an activity, not something that is passively bestowed upon you, not something that you magically discover in a top-ten article on the Huffington Post or from any specific\r\n\r\n<u>Hypothesis:</u> happiness is an action, and not passive. Therefore, it cannot be a feeling.\r\n\r\nIf this is true, then happiness does not happen on its own. It becomes more of a reaction rather than a feeling that happens on its own. And what would this reaction be to? As said, happiness comes from solving. This does not state that this is the only source of happiness. But that happiness comes from the this particular action.\r\n\r\n> We like the idea that there\u2019s some form of ultimate happiness that can be attained. We like the idea that we can alleviate all of our suffering permanently. We like the idea that we can feel fulfilled and satisfied with our lives forever. But we cannot.\r\n\r\nThis directly tackles the myth of the eternal happiness. Perpetuated by pretty much every approach covering the religious or sprirtiual domain. Feeling happy all the time would mean not feeling happy at all. Happiness is 'good' only because it is a comparitive pleasure. If it happened all the time, would we really be happy all the time?\r\n\r\nThis also means that chasing happiness all the time is unfulfilling and unsatisfying. And therefore, it would be worth the time and effort to work towards happiness and enjoy it at moments of success rather than strive to have as much of it as possible.\r\n\r\n> The true measurement of self-worth is not how a person feels about her positive experiences, but rather how she feels about her negative experiences.\r\n\r\nThis is a powerful quote. Everyone can deal with their positive experiences, but how the negative ones are handled decides how life is played out. The negative experiences are what shape life. The positive experiences are pleasures and do not contribute as much. This does not mean that one should seek out negative experiences to better themselves or to grow, but rather, one must have the mindset to overcome negative experiences, which is what their measure of self-worth, and thereby, their inner-strength becomes\r\n\r\n> construing everything in life so as to make yourself out to be constantly victimized requires just as much selfishness as the opposite.\r\n\r\nThis addresses the mindset that is constantly trying to think what is going wrong in life, or how things are not going well with you, or how you are the victim, and everything is someone else's fault. This will only makes someone powerless, and even happy experiences turn into not happy ones. Therefore, it is a waste of time to wallow in self-pity and blame. Taking the advice from the first quote, turn it into a problem that you can solve (or overcome) and you will find happiness in it.\r\n\r\n> It takes just as much energy and delusional self-aggrandizement to maintain the belief that one has insurmountable problems as that one has no problems at all.\r\n\r\nIs this a choice? Is the point here that since they both take the same amount of energy, we can choose what we want to put our energies into? Or is the point rather that both of them are energy sinks, and both are false, and therefore should not be our goals or habits?\r\n\r\n> The Internet has not just open-sourced information; it has also open-sourced insecurity, self-doubt, and shame.\r\n\r\nThis is a brilliant quote. One that I can write an entire article about, and I am sure someone else has already written an article about. It relates how one can see all the 'good' and the 'positive' experiences everywhere but in their life and then see how our life is 'pale' by comparison, and therefore they produce their own unhappiness.\r\n\r\n> We\u2019re apes. We think we\u2019re all sophisticated with our toaster ovens and designer footwear, but we\u2019re just a bunch of finely ornamented apes. And because we are apes, we instinctually measure ourselves against others and vie for status. The question is not whether we evaluate ourselves against others; rather, the question is by what standard do we measure ourselves?\r\n\r\nOkay. Saying we are apes does not mean I have a tail or a liking for bananas. Rather, it addresses the issue of how we are all driven by what are essentially animalistic tendencies. Take hunger for instance, a lot of times people are driven by the instinct of hunger. Overcoming these basic instincts is what makes us human as such.\r\n\r\nThat being said, comparison also comes naturally from the same tendencies. Wanting to have more, wanting something someone else has, wanting us to be better adapter or suited for something ... all are tendencies that we share with apes. So what do was base the comparison in/on? And is it something we want to care about? So someone has published more papers than you have - so what. Who cares. It's not a valid point of comparison.

The same author who also wrote <em>Solaris</em> (you must watch the Andrei Tarkovsky film adapted from this novel), he is well known for his disdain of human contact with alien civilisations. The cusp of his argument resides on the difficulties in such establishment of contact and the unfamiliarity with a civilisation different from ours. I did not realise this when I first started reading the book. I had read Solaris before, but for some reason, I could not place the name. However, towards the middle, it dawned on me who the author was, and I could see the connections and familiarity in the writing.</p>\n<p>Fiasco is based on human contact with an alien civilisation discovered amongst the reaches of the galaxy. The book presents a hard science viewpoint, and describes technological progress in detail. The humans in the book have achieved the means to use gravity (gravitics?) and can even bend time using the power of black holes. This presents the science side of things.</p>\n<p>The real beauty of the book lies in describing the <em>human</em> side of humans and the <em>alien</em> nature of aliens. By the end of the book, humans are literally forcing contact upon the civilisation that does not wish to be contacted, and in doing so, end up destroying their civilisation without the realisation of what exactly they were doing. At the same time, the differences in each individual human are drawn out. Some wish to annihilate the aliens for honour upon a perceived slight or attack, whereas others wish to offer an olive branch. As situations unravel, people change, and their viewpoints fluctuate. The books presents convincing arguments for each thoughtpoint.</p>\n<p>In terms of the aliens, they are a mysterious bunch. They never contact (except via human-readable message sent as text) and do not appear visually by going out of their way to hide. Or so the humans perceive. The book makes it point well regarding the absurdity of relying on conventional human perceptions of communication and technology when encountering an alien civilisation. By the end of the book, I was quite surprised at how amazing the book was, and somewhat regretting the fact that I had not read this before.</p>\n<p>In terms of the actual sci-fi stuff in the book, I loved how descriptive Lem is sometimes. When first on Titan, the description of otherworldly beauty is, well, beautiful. And the science in building the ship that can travel at near light-speed, or use black holes to dilute time using temporal gravitics, or describe fringe science as the basis for flight and technology, everything was very well inlaid with the rest of the story.</p>\n<p>I particularly liked how the AI aboard the ship (funnily named DEUS) was also human in the end, though this process is never understood until aliens are involved. In the mean-time, the alien planet turns out to be something completely unexpected.</p>\n<p>Here is my theory of what happened. The aliens were warring, in two or more factions. This led to all resources being divested towards militaristic endeavours. Their planet has a ring of ice, artifically placed into orbit, which causes rainfall at regular intervals. By assuming that they <em>wanted</em> this to happen, the aliens deliberately placed this ice-ring into orbit to have more land-mass and to also have periodic rainfall. The ship cannot find traces of aliens on the planet. However, it discovers crypts or underground chambers where there are calcium (or other life-form mineral) deposits. At the same time, the planet is blanketed in white noise at all frequencies, and can be seen to be a war between transmitters with no receptors in sight. The behaviour of the attacking/scout planes, and the absurdity of the communication channels is theorised to be an automated system in the book, which I agree with. The aliens therefore have hibernated underground or vegetated into the ground. This is stated plainly towards the end. Humans, meanwhile, mistake the automated defences (who are warring against each other) as an intention of attack and end up likely destroying the planet or the area.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I did not realise I had already written a post on this, and so wrote another one (shorter)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fiasco is a book written with amazing detail and wit, with descriptions of everything is otherworldly while still staying within the bounds of hard science. The book deals with, as Stanislaw Lem is famous for, the contact of humanity with alien civilisations. The entire philosophy of Lem boils down the <em>alieneness</em> of this contact, and the absurd fascination of humanity in to achieving this at all costs. This is also apparent in his novel, <em>Solaris</em>, which was remade a few times (the version by Tarkovsky is the best).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Spoilers ahead</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I read the book, and loved it in three parts. The first was set on Titan, where the description of the planet and its geology was simply mesmerising.

The third part was the crumbling of the human psyche as they approached the aliens. Here I will stop my comments, because I can do no justice to the book through it.

In essence, it allows the reader to broaden their minds to the 'human' anatomy of our very thoughts and actions, and in relaying this in the context of everything we do - including our action and technologies and even war itself.</p>", "body": "Fiasco is a book by Stanislaw Lem. The same author who also wrote *Solaris* (you must watch the Andrei Tarkovsky film adapted from this novel), he is well known for his disdain of human contact with alien civilisations. The cusp of his argument resides on the difficulties in such establishment of contact and the unfamiliarity with a civilisation different from ours. I did not realise this when I first started reading the book. I had read Solaris before, but for some reason, I could not place the name. However, towards the middle, it dawned on me who the author was, and I could see the connections and familiarity in the writing.\r\n\r\nFiasco is based on human contact with an alien civilisation discovered amongst the reaches of the galaxy. The book presents a hard science viewpoint, and describes technological progress in detail. The humans in the book have achieved the means to use gravity (gravitics?) and can even bend time using the power of black holes. This presents the science side of things.\r\n\r\nThe real beauty of the book lies in describing the *human* side of humans and the *alien* nature of aliens. By the end of the book, humans are literally forcing contact upon the civilisation that does not wish to be contacted, and in doing so, end up destroying their civilisation without the realisation of what exactly they were doing. At the same time, the differences in each individual human are drawn out. Some wish to annihilate the aliens for honour upon a perceived slight or attack, whereas others wish to offer an olive branch. As situations unravel, people change, and their viewpoints fluctuate. The books presents convincing arguments for each thoughtpoint.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the aliens, they are a mysterious bunch. They never contact (except via human-readable message sent as text) and do not appear visually by going out of their way to hide. Or so the humans perceive. The book makes it point well regarding the absurdity of relying on conventional human perceptions of communication and technology when encountering an alien civilisation. By the end of the book, I was quite surprised at how amazing the book was, and somewhat regretting the fact that I had not read this before.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the actual sci-fi stuff in the book, I loved how descriptive Lem is sometimes. When first on Titan, the description of otherworldly beauty is, well, beautiful. And the science in building the ship that can travel at near light-speed, or use black holes to dilute time using temporal gravitics, or describe fringe science as the basis for flight and technology, everything was very well inlaid with the rest of the story.\r\n\r\nI particularly liked how the AI aboard the ship (funnily named DEUS) was also human in the end, though this process is never understood until aliens are involved. In the mean-time, the alien planet turns out to be something completely unexpected.\r\n\r\nHere is my theory of what happened. The aliens were warring, in two or more factions. This led to all resources being divested towards militaristic endeavours. Their planet has a ring of ice, artifically placed into orbit, which causes rainfall at regular intervals. By assuming that they *wanted* this to happen, the aliens deliberately placed this ice-ring into orbit to have more land-mass and to also have periodic rainfall. The ship cannot find traces of aliens on the planet. However, it discovers crypts or underground chambers where there are calcium (or other life-form mineral) deposits. At the same time, the planet is blanketed in white noise at all frequencies, and can be seen to be a war between transmitters with no receptors in sight. The behaviour of the attacking/scout planes, and the absurdity of the communication channels is theorised to be an automated system in the book, which I agree with. The aliens therefore have hibernated underground or vegetated into the ground. This is stated plainly towards the end. Humans, meanwhile, mistake the automated defences (who are warring against each other) as an intention of attack and end up likely destroying the planet or the area.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> I did not realise I had already written a post on this, and so wrote another one (shorter)\r\n\r\nFiasco is a book written with amazing detail and wit, with descriptions of everything is otherworldly while still staying within the bounds of hard science. The book deals with, as Stanislaw Lem is famous for, the contact of humanity with alien civilisations. The entire philosophy of Lem boils down the *alieneness* of this contact, and the absurd fascination of humanity in to achieving this at all costs. This is also apparent in his novel, *Solaris*, which was remade a few times (the version by Tarkovsky is the best).\r\n\r\n> Spoilers ahead\r\n\r\nI read the book, and loved it in three parts. The first was set on Titan, where the description of the planet and its geology was simply mesmerising. The second part was when the intersteller flight was achieved, and described in great detail in the book. This included the application of 'gravitics' and using black holes to propel time itself through dilation. Very very fancy sci-fi concepts, and really got me stretching my imagination. The third part was the crumbling of the human psyche as they approached the aliens. Here I will stop my comments, because I can do no justice to the book through it.

Sofia is the capital of Bulgaria, and is one of the nicest cities I have visited in terms of life and just the peacefulness of being there. Since it isn't such a hotspot of tourist activitiy, walking around felt more authentic and inspiring than the usual throngs of people flocking to places.

However, it will soon be joining (in the future) the Schengen area, and has started adopting certain things. Under this, the government allows any visitor who has a valid multi-entry Schengen visa to also visit Bulgaria without additional visas. This allowed me to enter the country from Athens. Flights were very cheap (&lt;20 euros). The currency of Bulgaria is the <em>lev</em> and it is locked to a fixed exchange rate with respect to the euro.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hostel-mostel\">Hostel Mostel</h2>\n<p>I stayed in the nicest hostel so far in Sofia. Called Hostel Mostel, the layout is simple. The staff are super friendly. But what is best about this place is the encouragement of interactions with other guests.

Sofia is the capital of Bulgaria, and is one of the nicest cities I have visited in terms of life and just the peacefulness of being there. Since it isn't such a hotspot of tourist activitiy, walking around felt more authentic and inspiring than the usual throngs of people flocking to places. Sure, there were tourists going to places, but after Athens, this was a very refreshing change.\r\n\r\n## Visa\r\n\r\nBulgaria is within the EU, but is not in the Schengen area. However, it will soon be joining (in the future) the Schengen area, and has started adopting certain things. Under this, the government allows any visitor who has a valid multi-entry Schengen visa to also visit Bulgaria without additional visas. This allowed me to enter the country from Athens. Flights were very cheap (<20 euros). The currency of Bulgaria is the *lev* and it is locked to a fixed exchange rate with respect to the euro.\r\n\r\n## Hostel Mostel\r\n\r\nI stayed in the nicest hostel so far in Sofia. Called Hostel Mostel, the layout is simple. The staff are super friendly. But what is best about this place is the encouragement of interactions with other guests. The place is simple, but very clean. And everything just works. Also, it is very cheap. The hostel beds are well isolated (in a dorm) from others, and have amazing things like a curtain, little bed lights and lockers. It was genuinely an amazing experience staying there. \r\n\r\n## Attractions\r\n\r\nThe general attractions in Sofia are the various old and cultural buildings and museums. These are beatiful, especially the churches. There are also various food markets and farmers markets that are a great experience for the local culture. Cherries were incredibly cheap, and me and other people from the hostel ended up eating them in kilos.\r\n\r\n## Food\r\n\r\nFood is cheap, and very tasty.

That's a lot of museums! And these are maybe the popular half of all museums in the city. If pressed for time, I absolutely recommend going to the National Archaelogical, Benaki, and National Historical Museums. They are amazing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"parks\">Parks</h2>\n<p>Greece has lots of parks everywhere. They are well laid out, always clean, and safe. Once can idle about, sit in the shade, or have a quick nap. I did all three. I also spent a few hours reading a book under an ancient tree. It felt quite good to sit under the cool shade while the sun was strong but not scalding. The Acropolis especially has lots of parks surrounding it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"monastiraki-flea-market\">Monastiraki Flea Market</h2>\n<p>Athens has a famous flea market called Monastiraki, which is a short walk away from the Acropolis. The flea market is an array of stalls, or a long line of stalls, or an area filled with small shops, whatever description gets it. In my head, the description for a flea market was something more basic, and more <em>un-civilised</em>. Instead, I had to walk around for a bit until I realised that <em>this</em> was the flea market. The shops are well set-up, have a proper roof, everything like a normal shop would. Except that they sell these <em>novelty</em> like items. I wasn't interested in any of them, but I can imagine some people having a shopping stroll through the area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"food\">Food</h2>\n<p>Now to the main part of being in Greece - the food. Everything feels fresh, and it affects the taste a lot. Most important are the salads, fish, and cheese. These I ate in bountiful proportions. I had so much food everyday, and even when it was the same thing, even salads, I enjoyed it quite a lot. The most common thing to eat is the salads - the typical greek salads has a good mix of ingredients. Depending on what you have, you can select different types of salads. I went mostly for salads with cheese (feta!) and fish (always fresh!). For lunch, there was an abundance of options, but my preference was always towards greek delicacies such as fresh fish. I even tried octopus and squids, which were amazing. The map shows the places where I ate, and recommend others to do indulge in as well.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of street foods. My favourite amongst these were the Gyros. They are cheap, simple, and very filling. I went to the famous place(s) in the city, where there was quite a queue, and had these simple yet tasty delicacies. Along with these, there are lots of options for dessert as well. Being from India, these were much closer to what I have experienced in India as well as clear inspirations and influences from Turkey. All in all, the trip in terms of food was an experience by itself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"crete\">Crete</h2>\n<p>Crete is a Greek island in the Mediterranean sea. Being away from the mainland, it is cooler and gets the fresh(-er) sea air. The main cities are Heraklion in center-right and Chania (pronounced Hania) in the west. Heraklion has more older structures whereas Chania is surrounded by amazing beaches. The food of the island is still Greek, but has its own distinctive style and texture. It is referred to as <em>Cretan</em>, and consists of local fish and bread.

Semantic Web Conference took place on 3rd-7th June 2018 at Heraklion, Crete, Greece. The actual location was the Aldemar Knossos Resort, a 5-star beach resort about 30mins outside of Heraklion. One thing to note is the name, where the 'E' no longer stands for European, as it did in the past. For a few years now (since 2010), it has been 'Extended'. Regardless, it is one of the top-tier conferences in the Semantic Web domain. The others are the Web conference (previously WWW), ISWC, and SEMANTiCS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"visa-woes\">Visa woes</h2>\n<p>Last year, I had a workshop paper accepted at ESWC, but could not go due to the timing and my visa issues (which never seem to end). This year too, I had a quite horrible experience with the Irish Immigration Service - they delayed an important document in the post which made me miss an appointment with the Austrian embassy, whereby I missed attending the W3C workshop on Privacy Vocabularies in Vienna, as well as missing out on attending the Web conference in Lyon, France, where I had a workshop paper accepted. Following this, I had what I can only describe as a cyclic experience with the Greek embassy here in Dublin where I repeatedly made rounds to get my visa. Do note that my application was complete and all documents were satisfactory. I was simply riding the bureaucratic amusement park ride, which went up and down depending on the moods of the officer sitting there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-there\">Getting there</h2>\n<p>Regardless, I made it to the conference. My flight was via Athens, and from there I had another flight to Heraklion. This was flight was much smaller, both in size as well as duration, and the plane was mostly empty. The small plane translated to a very pleasant consistent hum, and I fell asleep gazing at the thousands of islands in the Greek sea. It was a fabulous nap.</p>\n<p>Upon reaching Heraklion, I had to take a taxi to the resort, which was outside the bounds of the city. Upon reaching the resort, I was told at the reception that my payment was due, which was strange since our accommodation is booked through a travel agency, and they should have made all the payments. Regardless, the hotel was professional about it, and we decided to handle the issue the next morning. </p>\n<p>The first thing to notice about Greece is the weather - consistent blue skies and consistent warm sun - amazing! After months in Ireland, this was very very magical. I understood why Europeans rave about the Mediterranean. The weather in Athens is a little more bland as compared to the islands, because of the ocean air.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1-wFoLtIFOvNePVsU_-l2z7fRLoSfcHur\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></iframe>\n\n<h2 id=\"hotel\">Hotel</h2>\n<p>On paper, the hotel is rated with 5 stars. This means it has all the amenities, I forget which those are, but it was very <em>posh</em>. It had a swimming pool, no, it had <em>several</em> swimming pools, a beach bar, a restaurant overlooking the amazing sea. My room was about 100-150 meters from the sea, which I considered to be really good. I had a double bed, a bath in the bathroom, a TV, a table outside. They even had a bottle of wine in the room. I never ended up using it thinking I would get charged.</p>\n<p>Breakfast was included in the price of the room, so every morning, I found myself at a huge spread of greek food - feta, fish, eggs, salads, breads, all very fresh and delicious. And this was hotel food, which meant the food in local places is even more amazing. Having breakfast while watching the sun rise slowly in the morning skies over those cool blue waters is a luxury I found myself indulging in as much as I could.</p>\n<p>Lunch was included in the price of the conference, so all the conference attendees swarmed the restaurant. Yet, only about half of it was full. Lunch was more of the greek cuisine - fish, chicken, more feta, wine on tap. All good. Very filling. There were lots of salads, fruits, yogurt (thick, creamy, delicious) with honey. I had a very filling (and I'm sure healthy) food everyday.</p>\n<p>Night time dinners were by ourselves - I was accompanied by 4 other colleagues from my research group, so there was some known company. For the first day though, we went to the nearest place, which wasn't that great, but it was not bad. I had a salad, it was not that filling, but the portions are large in Greece, and it is fresh.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-conference-workshops\">The Conference - Workshops</h2>\n<p>The first day of the conference was the workshop sessions. I had two papers to present. One was a position paper that I presented in the morning at the MEPDaW workshop, and the other was based on collaborative work I presented at the SW4CH workshop.

It was largely an extension of the first day, without me having to present anything. I met people at lunch, and in the coffee breaks, and had some good impromptu talks about various things. Dinner was at an restaurant close by called Saradari that is famous for its fish food. I had an octopus pasta, and it was simply delicious.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-conference-main-tracks\">The Conference - Main Tracks</h2>\n<p>The third day marked the beginning of the main tracks of the conference. Each day of the conference started with a keynote by an eminent personality in the field of Semantic Web, and was followed by parallel sessions in three rooms. The grouping of papers was by topic. Overall, the routine was pretty much the same throughout the three days - keynote, followed by presentation session, lunch, another presentation session, coffee break, and the last presentation session. On the first day, there was a reception at the beach bar (which was, as the name would suggest, down by the beach). There were free cocktails for everyone, some music playing on, and lots of conversations happening. I had some mojito and tequila sunrises, which were decent. Dinner was at a resturant in hersonissos - a town near the resort, and it was nice to walk through the town.</p>\n<p>On the fourth day there was a poster session towards the end of the day. The setup was such that there were posters throughout the room and people could walk around, talk to the presenters, and interact with each other as well. I walked around to get a feel for established work as well as new projects starting up. It was a good format that encouraged talking and interaction between people. There was a gala dinner later in the evening, which was postponed by one hour because the weather was extraordinarily nice and everyone was probably at the beach. I was sitting in the beach chairs reading a book, sunbathing in the crisp sun and the cool wind. Something that I had imagined countless times before, and was finally doing in reality. Gala dinner was setup with tables near swimming pool. Wine was served, everything else was a buffet. Everyone danced later to the tunes of music. It was very informal, but at the same time, I could not shake off the 'academic' feeling all around me.</p>\n<p>The fifth day was the last day of the conference. This was also the day of my presentation for a resource paper - GDPRtEXT. It was the last presentation of the day. My laptop did not work for setting up the presentation - as usual, some issue with the HDMI. But the guy before me was cool about it (thanks Mike!) and let me use his laptop to continue my session. My presentation was unplanned, sort of. I knew the slides, but the words were all impromptu. I think it was better than what I thought it would be. Apparently I did a little too much lawyer-bashing. I had a few people come and ask me about it later. But since it was the last session, there wasn't anyone around later to talk. Dinner was again at a local restaurant - right next to the sea. They gave me a platter of fresh fish to choose from. When the fish finally arrived (it took a time to cook), I could tell how fresh it was because I tasted the sea in it. I realised how much taste the fish loses (or acquires in a negative sense) after it has been outside the water. Meanwhile, we had some snacks, and some really delicious cretan bread.</p>\n<h2 id=\"networking\">Networking</h2>\n<p>I spent a lot of time talking to people, trying to find out about their work and relating it to mine. This was my first time networking in this sense, as I usually am aloof and not talkative in conferences or gatherings. However, the networking yielded good results.

Semantic Web Conference took place on 3rd-7th June 2018 at Heraklion, Crete, Greece. The actual location was the Aldemar Knossos Resort, a 5-star beach resort about 30mins outside of Heraklion. One thing to note is the name, where the 'E' no longer stands for European, as it did in the past. For a few years now (since 2010), it has been 'Extended'. Regardless, it is one of the top-tier conferences in the Semantic Web domain. The others are the Web conference (previously WWW), ISWC, and SEMANTiCS.\r\n\r\n## Visa woes\r\n\r\nLast year, I had a workshop paper accepted at ESWC, but could not go due to the timing and my visa issues (which never seem to end). This year too, I had a quite horrible experience with the Irish Immigration Service - they delayed an important document in the post which made me miss an appointment with the Austrian embassy, whereby I missed attending the W3C workshop on Privacy Vocabularies in Vienna, as well as missing out on attending the Web conference in Lyon, France, where I had a workshop paper accepted. Following this, I had what I can only describe as a cyclic experience with the Greek embassy here in Dublin where I repeatedly made rounds to get my visa. Do note that my application was complete and all documents were satisfactory. I was simply riding the bureaucratic amusement park ride, which went up and down depending on the moods of the officer sitting there.\r\n\r\n## Getting there\r\n\r\nRegardless, I made it to the conference. My flight was via Athens, and from there I had another flight to Heraklion. This was flight was much smaller, both in size as well as duration, and the plane was mostly empty. The small plane translated to a very pleasant consistent hum, and I fell asleep gazing at the thousands of islands in the Greek sea. It was a fabulous nap.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching Heraklion, I had to take a taxi to the resort, which was outside the bounds of the city. Upon reaching the resort, I was told at the reception that my payment was due, which was strange since our accommodation is booked through a travel agency, and they should have made all the payments. Regardless, the hotel was professional about it, and we decided to handle the issue the next morning. \r\n\r\nThe first thing to notice about Greece is the weather - consistent blue skies and consistent warm sun - amazing! After months in Ireland, this was very very magical. I understood why Europeans rave about the Mediterranean. The weather in Athens is a little more bland as compared to the islands, because of the ocean air.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1-wFoLtIFOvNePVsU_-l2z7fRLoSfcHur\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n## Hotel\r\n\r\nOn paper, the hotel is rated with 5 stars. This means it has all the amenities, I forget which those are, but it was very *posh*. It had a swimming pool, no, it had *several* swimming pools, a beach bar, a restaurant overlooking the amazing sea. My room was about 100-150 meters from the sea, which I considered to be really good. I had a double bed, a bath in the bathroom, a TV, a table outside. They even had a bottle of wine in the room. I never ended up using it thinking I would get charged.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was included in the price of the room, so every morning, I found myself at a huge spread of greek food - feta, fish, eggs, salads, breads, all very fresh and delicious. And this was hotel food, which meant the food in local places is even more amazing. Having breakfast while watching the sun rise slowly in the morning skies over those cool blue waters is a luxury I found myself indulging in as much as I could.\r\n\r\nLunch was included in the price of the conference, so all the conference attendees swarmed the restaurant. Yet, only about half of it was full. Lunch was more of the greek cuisine - fish, chicken, more feta, wine on tap. All good. Very filling. There were lots of salads, fruits, yogurt (thick, creamy, delicious) with honey. I had a very filling (and I'm sure healthy) food everyday.\r\n\r\nNight time dinners were by ourselves - I was accompanied by 4 other colleagues from my research group, so there was some known company. For the first day though, we went to the nearest place, which wasn't that great, but it was not bad. I had a salad, it was not that filling, but the portions are large in Greece, and it is fresh.\r\n\r\n## The Conference - Workshops\r\n\r\nThe first day of the conference was the workshop sessions.

I managed to convey that we needed to be near the Museum of Technology and he dropped us right there.

It was a new bar, opened recently in 2017. They had their normal lager, which was light and mild. They also had another one on tap, which was more stronger (about 14% I think) and was slightly sweet.

I ordered sausage and eggs, and was expecting a small portion. But then I was served this nice full-meal sized portion and it delighted me. The food was very well prepared.

At the corner of the street there is an ice-cream shop called Koun which is famous for its flavors. I went in there and had three big scoops of - rum'n'raisin, caramelized fig, and lavendar - for only 4\u20ac. The ice-cream was very tasty. The lavender flavor was the most bizarre ice-cream I've every had - possibly because I've never actually tasted lavender before. My memory of lavender is only its fragrance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dinner\">Dinner</h3>\n<p>After the tiring day I had, I walked back to the hostel and went back to Cafe Stur for dinner. I had a Hungarian scramble - which is toast and potatoes - same as before - with scrambled eggs and spicy sausages. Everything tasted well.

I was flying with Aer Lingus, which meant that service was better (than RyanAir) though I made the mistake of asking for tea on-board. I was busy in reading, and habitually said I'd like a cup of tea (please!) and was handed one with a prompt inquiry about how much I owed (a few euros I think). Thankfully, I had a few coins with me. Flying was okay, just travel. The seats were comfortable and I finished the book I was reading - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea\">The Old Man and The Sea</a> and started another - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_of_Small_Things\">The God of Small Things</a>. </p>\n<p>Once at Vienna, the airport style caught my attention. The airport was vividly decorated to portray everything Vienna had to offer - it's art, music, food. It looked like old culture being caught in a modern, sleek bottle. I liked this merging of the two. At the airport, the walls and the aisles were decorated with the attractions in Vienna. Paintings of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Klimt\">Gustav Klimt</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel\">Tower of Babel</a>, and even a food item  - the famous dish served by <a href=\"https://www.figlmueller.at/en/\">Figlmuller</a>.</p>\n<p>We went to the city via a 6-person taxi.

While that was being sorted, we managed to get one room, dumped all our luggage there. The rooms in this hotel are <em>budget</em> to the highest degree. Everything is covered in cheap plastic paint, and the entire room is just <em>one</em> room. The shower is situated without any separation, with the toilet being in a closet or sorts. There's a basin besides the shower, and the only light in the room is situated on top of this arrangement. At the other end of the room is a TV mounted in the corner. There is a double bed in between, with a chair and stool besides it. Everything looks <em>minimally</em> functional, and uncomfortable. Not a cheerful thought to know that I would be staying there for about 6 days.</p>\n<p>Knowing all of this, and putting our luggage away for the moment, we decided to go to the city, get something to eat, have a look around, and hoped that when we got back, everything would be sorted.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"The beautiful buildings of Vienna\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/vienna_museums_4.jpg\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"wiener-linien\">Wiener Linien</h3>\n<p>The underground / metro / trains in Wien are run by a company called <em>Wiener Linien</em> which means <em>Wien Lines</em> (or something similar). The transport system is famous for its efficiency and for connecting all parts of Wien. There are several lines, colored such as Red, Green, Orange, and Brown that run on different paths. Tickets can be bought as all-you-can-travel passes for 24 to 72 hours. We bought these for us as traveling via the underground / metro is the best way to travel around.</p>\n<h3 id=\"messe-prater\">Messe-Prater</h3>\n<p>We started from the station called Messe-Prater, which, translates (in a completely amateur way) to  fair or exhibition (says Google Translate) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prater\">Prater</a> is a large park in the area. In the coming days, this would be one of our common go-to points for transport, since it was convenient for everyone, and also the closest stop for the conference.</p>\n<h3 id=\"schottenring\">Schottenring</h3>\n<p>We got off the train at <em>Schottenring</em> and randomly walked about. We marveled at the facade of the buildings and how everything seemed <em>different</em> and full of <em>culture</em>. People dressed nicer, and every building was beautiful. We walked and walked. And finally came across a restaurant called Vapiano (which is actually a chain-restaurant, but I did not know this at the time) and had dinner there. I ordered lasagna, because I like it, and because I wanted to taste it. It was good, but not exceedingly so. I put it down at the moment to perhaps lasagna being just a generic dish. Later, I attributed it to the non-specialty of the restaurant.</p>\n<p>After dinner, we walked across the city on the stone streets with our eyes upwards on the buildings and the many facades it had. Statues and sigils and symbols were embossed, engraved, and hung everywhere. It gave it a bizarre modern rendition of older architecture. The rendition of fashion and art in the glass windows by the street gave the entire area an aura of elegance. </p>\n<h3 id=\"st-stephens-cathedral\">St. Stephen's Cathedral</h3>\n<p>Continuing walking, we found ourselves suddenly in the presence of a huge cathedral - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Stephen%27s_Cathedral,_Vienna\">St. Stephen's</a> - and it was amazing and impressive. The cathedral has two towers - the north and the south, with the northern tower being incomplete. The southern tower rises an impressive height and used to serve as a watchtower. The inside of the cathedral reflects the large size of the building with empty space lending an atmosphere of austerity.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/vienna_carriage.jpg\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"das-loft\">Das Loft</h3>\n<p>We walked to the river <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube\">Danube</a>, which runs through Vienna, and is famous from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Danube\">waltz by Johann Strauss</a> (the starting song in 2001: A Space Odessey). On the other side of the river is a sky-bar called <em>Das Loft</em> considered one of the very high-class and famous bars in Vienna. We went there, and were asked to wait. And then asked to wait some more. Finally, it was let known, that we didn't have the required dress (or fashion sense) and maybe if we went back home, and dressed up a bit, we could try again. This was all done politely, and reflected the status of the place. Naturally, we wanted what we could not have even more.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pubs-in-vienna\">Pubs in Vienna</h3>\n<p>After the denied entry in Das Loft, we walked around till we found a pub, or a place to have a drink. Once I entered the place, I was perplexed by the lack of <em>choice</em> when it came to beers. This is because Irish pubs have several options just on tap, and there's more in bottles and other places. Here beer is just <em>beer</em> and everything else comes in a bottle. The local variety is a light, slightly sweet and mild lager, and is tasty and well suited to the autumn weather.</p>\n<p>Sitting in the pub, I watched the place across through the window, where a house-party or gathering seemed to be in progress. People clustered into groups, and smoked, clutching their wine glasses. Vienna does not have a law prohibiting smoking indoors and in public places. This means that people smoke everywhere. This makes it somewhat annoying, though there are newer places that have started being exclusively non-smoking.</p>\n<p>After the drink, I went back to the hotel. The conference had been kind and organized enough to send my registration and goodies bag to the hotel, and I picked that up from the reception on the way up. I slept after the tiring first day.</p>\n<h2 id=\"saturday-21st\">Saturday 21st</h2>\n<h3 id=\"breakfast\">Breakfast</h3>\n<p>The hotel provided breakfast for 7\u20ac, which is quite expensive. Breakfast all over Vienna (in hostels and such) is bread/toast, ham, salami, cheese, yogurt, cereals, eggs, veggies or salads, orange juice, and coffee. It is a good breakfast, but does not live up to the city's addiction to taste in food. Nevertheless, I had breakfast and went to the conference center.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wu\">WU</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"My ISWC conference badge and a complimentary USB drive with all the program and papers on it.\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/ISWC_ID.jpg\"></p>\n<p>The first two days of the conference were allocated to all the workshops. These took place in the Teaching Center at the far end of the university. Walking through the campus, the buildings were all modern and designed quite differently. The inside of the teaching center was spacious and well planned.</p>\n<p>There were several coffee breaks in between the sessions, and lunch after noon. There was lemon and mint flavored water, which I found to be quite tasty. The lunch was the best I had at a conference or a gathering (venue). It had some of Vienna's delicacies. The desserts at the end were good too.</p>\n<p>After the first day of workshop sessions, I went back to the hotel, and simply fell into a nap. The next day being my presentation, I wanted to finish some work for it and rehearse. So I stayed at the hotel while others went out to explore the city. </p>\n<h3 id=\"wiener-schnitzel\">Wiener Schnitzel</h3>\n<p>After waking up from the nap, I decided to go to a nearby cafe so as to save time and get back to work. I found a decent cafe (<em>decent reviews</em>) called Moziak and went there. I had the famous Wiener <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnitzel\">Schnitzel</a> which is a thin piece of meat that is fried. I ordered the pork variety rather than the veal. The meal came with finger chips and salad. I also had a glass of wine. The meat was fried lightly but still retained its distinct taste. It was good. I couldn't wait to try this dish in a good place that has prepared it well. For that, I had set my sight on Figlmuller.</p>\n<h3 id=\"prater\">Prater</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"The beautiful buildings of Vienna\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/riesenrad.jpg\"></p>\n<p>After dinner, I walked around the Prater area, mostly exploring the place and the streets. I found a lot of cafes there, probably because of the proximity with the park. I also found a lot of places with bizarre red-blue lighting displayed prominently on their doors and windows. I found out later that these are sex-related establishments and prostitution is legal in Vienna. In fact, it is quite famous in Europe for this, after Amsterdam and Germany. These places are usually isolated, well marked, and therefore are never a problem to anyone.</p>\n<p>I later went back to the hotel, worked on my presentation the next day, and then had a good sleep.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sunday-22nd\">Sunday 22nd</h2>\n<p>This was the day of <em>my</em> presentation. I had breakfast at the hotel, and ensured that I was well fed. My usual routine is to not eat anything until I've given my presentation because I believe it makes me lazy and lethargic and I am not able to  present it with passion or a high level of energy. However, this time, I wanted to make sure I was not hungry in the afternoon, and wanted to be able to focus on the presentation when the time came. If needed, I would have had some coffee.</p>\n<h3 id=\"privacy-online-workshop\">Privacy Online Workshop</h3>\n<p>I was to give a presentation on my paper at the Privacy Online workshop, which focused on specific aspects of privacy and security. My topic was about GDPR, the new regulation to be enforced next year that would change how companies collect, use, and share data. My PhD research is in documenting the provenance of activities as they happen and use data, and to find ways to prove or identify their compliance with this law. I was anxious to see what the community makes of my work.</p>\n<p>The room the workshop was to be held in was a presentation room. It had the projector and screen centered in the room. Around it were two layers of tables and chair in a square fashion. It was effective and everyone could see everyone. I could see people walk in, and recognizing the who's who of the field, experts whose name I had only read in papers made me feel a little intimidated. Presenting my work to <em>these</em> people, who all seemed to know each other in well-enough friendly terms made me a little scared. I wasn't nervous about presenting - I have no trouble with that - but I was more aware that this is an <em>opportunity</em> and therefore it was <em>important</em>.</p>\n<p>Dave, who is my main supervisor (PI or guide in some places) was there as well, to present another paper from the same research project. I relied on him to make certain concepts clear and to provide the motivation for why we were targeting that particular law. The fact that the organizer and some people in the room also had research interests in GDPR made me a little confident about presenting there. My presentation was after Dave's, which meant that I could rely on some things being already made clear. This made my job easier as I only had to focus on my part. So I went in there, and I gave the presentation. I didn't have a timer, but I seemed to do well on time.</p>\n<p>After the presentation, no one really had any questions, so I'm not sure whether that was good or bad. But the organizer(s) asked a few good questions. She (the main organizer) also spoke about collaboration as she is working on the same area as well. It was a good experience. I also had some of my colleagues present in the room, and I think it encouraged me to some extent. </p>\n<p>I attended the workshop until the last session, which ended in the evening. After that I had to go to the hotel and change for the conference dinner.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dinner-at-rathaus\">Dinner at Rathaus</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"The city hall was lavish and beautiful\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/city_hall_dinner.jpg\"></p>\n<p>We were to have dinner at the Vienna City Hall at Rathaus (that's also the name of the metro station) courtesy of the conference. I freshened up and made my way there.</p>\n<p>The hall itself is impressive in its architecture. There was wine and beer being handed out. Finger food (<em>dinner</em>) had a queue as is the custom and necessity of conferences. There was a live band though I don't think the Blue Danube was being played by them. Later, there were dances, and I remember them as - Waltz, Samba, Rumba, Cha cha cha, and Jive. </p>\n<p>We had a dinner, a few conversations, and then made our way out to a pub which was quite a (<em>post-dinner</em>) walk. Sadly, it turned out that the pub was closed. We continued our walk towards the city.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cafe-mozart\">Cafe Mozart</h3>\n<p>We went to Cafe Mozart (which is one of the places where people go have cakes) and I had the mini trio - which had three mini cakes of sachertorte, mozarttorte, and heimbeer-topfen. All three were best, though I found the famous sachertorte to be rather dry and unimpressive. My favorite of the three was the mozarttorte. I also had hot chocolate with it. Vienna meant I was hogging at least 10 desserts everyday. And I'm not joking, I was really eating a lot of sugar. As I said to one of my friends - <strong>Vienna = no rules</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"monday-23rd\">Monday 23rd</h2>\n<p>This was the first day of the conference, as the other days were for the workshops. I had a leisurely sleep and made my way to the Wien Messe Congress Convention Center - an impressive building that is large and very accommodating. There were several parallel sessions in progress throughout the day, and one could move between them as needed. Coffee breaks every few hours meant we could talk and network. Lunch was served in the big room (I think which could also be expanded to create a <em>bigger</em> presentation place) and it was as impressive as ever.  Dessert was a berry mousse which I loved and gorged on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"city-center-random-walk\">City Center Random Walk</h3>\n<p>After the conference, me and a colleague went to the city center to walk around rather aimlessly wherever the fancy took us. My only aim for the day was to eat the sacahertorte at the place famous for it - <a href=\"https://www.sacher.com/en/original-sacher-cake/sacher-cafe/\">Cafe Sacher</a>. We decided to have that after dinner. However, with our random walks, we couldn't find and agree on a place to have dinner. And it started to be a bit annoying as both of us were quite hungry and also had to pee.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"A random painting in the bathroom\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/bathroom_painting.jpg\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"italian-cuisine\">Italian Cuisine</h3>\n<p>We found an Italian place at the corner, and just walked in. It looked a bit small and cramped but there was a staircase that led upstairs. Once up, the place was quite large, and there was a crowd. It was a bit expensive, but the food was prepared well and with a certain subtlety. I had the tortellini made with spinach and it was excellent with a very subtle taste and excellent flavor. I had red wine (which I think went well with it).</p>\n<h3 id=\"sachertorte\">Sachertorte</h3>\n<p>Once dinner was had, we walked over to Cafe Sacher, found it to be very luxurious (<em>posh!</em>) and were treated with utmost politeness and courtesy. I ordered the sachertorte and a hot chocolate. It came in. I ate it. I was pure bliss. The taste was <em>very very good</em>. So good, that I had to say, \"_shut up, let me eat this\". The layered chocolate cake is filled with two layers of apricot jam which balances itself against the dryness. It is an excellent balanced taste.</p>\n<p>After that, with me completely sated mind, body and soul, we went back to the hotel where I proceeded to read and sleep.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tuesday-24th\">Tuesday 24th</h2>\n<h3 id=\"north-tower\">North Tower</h3>\n<p>This was another day where I went to the conference, had lunch, attended a few sessions. In the afternoon, about three of us snuck out to go explore the city. We went to St. Stephen's Cathedral to go up the tower. It cost us 4.50\u20ac and we had to suffer climbing extremely narrow, claustrophobic, winding stairs right up to the top. I couldn't believe I paid money to torture myself. I also realized how out of shape I was. The view from the top was nice.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"The beautiful buildings of Vienna\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/vienna_museums_5.jpg\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"cafe-central\">Cafe Central</h3>\n<p>After the (<em>fiasco</em>) of the stairs, we headed to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_Central\">Cafe Central</a> which is rather famous for being frequented by prominent personalities such as Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Adolf Hitler, Stalin, Trotsky, and so on. I had a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_Melange\">Wiener Melange</a> which is the special coffee from Vienna. It was subtle and tasty (which all of Vienna is, I think). A colleague ordered the peanut and caramel cake (<em>snickers!</em>) and it was very tasty. Cakes are a specialty of Vienna. After this, we went to the nearest metro station and were back at the conference venue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heuriger-fuhrgassl-huber\">Heuriger Fuhrgassl-Huber</h3>\n<p>The gala dinner was at <a href=\"http://www.fuhrgassl-huber.at/\">Heuriger Fuhrgassl-Huber</a>, which is a famous vineyard in Vienna. It makes white wine from locally grown grapes (Vienna does not produce any red). From the conference venue, we had buses arranged to take us there and back, which was very convenient. The dinner was a buffet, with a whole roast hog available as well. The food was nice, though everything got over pretty quick and I could not go for seconds. The wine (produced at the vineyard itself) was light and sweet and was mildly acidic. We sat, ate, drank, chatted, and then went back.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wednesday-25th\">Wednesday 25th</h2>\n<p>This was the last day of the conference. I packed my bags, checked out of the hotel, and went to the conference venue. I was there until lunch, after which, I left for the hostel I was to stay at. This required me to take a train and then switch to another line which actually went somewhere near the hostel. I had at first thought that traveling with a small suitcase would be an issue, but it was not hassle at all.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wombat-hostels\">Wombat Hostels</h3>\n<p>We had a booking at Wombat hostels, which have a good rating for their cleanliness and ordered stays. The one we (me and a colleague) were booked in was situated in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naschmarkt\">Naschmarkt</a> which is a popular local market, sort of like a farmer's market, but the stalls are more like shops here. The hostel itself was nice. It was the first time where I had to put on the bed sheet, put on the duvet cover, put on the pillow cover, and then take them all out and hand them over when checking out. But everything else was very well organized and straight-forward. Our keys were key-cards, and our lockers could only be opened <em>and</em> closed using the key-cards.</p>\n<h3 id=\"naschmarkt\">Naschmarkt</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"The market houses several stalls stretched out for nearly a kilometer\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/vienna_naschmarkt2.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Once I was settled in, freshened up, and ready to go out, I explored the Naschmarkt. I walked from start to end and could see the <em>cheap</em> shops lined up offering all kinds of whacky things. It was mostly the <em>immigrants</em> who were manning the shops and the restaurants. As I was walking past, I hard shouts of \"<em>shahrukh khan... shahrukh khan...</em>\" and it took me a while to realize that they were directed at me. I turned back and it were the women in the stall behind, with the one going \"...<em>shahrukh khan?</em>\" with a questioning, almost hopeful look in her eyes. I laughed and said no, but thank you for thinking I am.</p>\n<h3 id=\"history-of-torture-museum\">History of Torture Museum</h3>\n<p>After that market, I walked to the torture museum. I was curious what it was. The ticket was only 4.50\u20ac, which wasn't that bad. There were several exhibits inside ranging from witch-burning to more recent examples of prisoners in prisons of more developed countries. The museum states its goal to be awareness of torture and that it is vehemently opposed to torture itself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"museumsquartier\">Museumsquartier</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museumsquartier\">Museumsquartier</a> is filled with Museums (as the name says), and also contains the parliament square. I spend my time traveling around the area until I was finally tired enough, after which I walked over to the city center.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/vienna_museums4.jpg\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"cafe-alt-wien\">Cafe Alt Wien</h3>\n<p>For dinner, I went to Cafe Alt Wien, which is situated in a tucked away street and is fairly inconspicuous about its presence. Inside though, the art is well laid (<em>Vienna!</em>) and the food is good. I ordered a wiener melange and a frankfurter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cafe-demel\">Cafe Demel</h3>\n<p>There was a court case as to the origins of the sachertorte. There's quite a bit of history there. Read it up on the internet. To put it shortly, the final version of the cake was made at Cafe Demel by the successor of the inventor. Therefore, there are two <em>official</em> versions of the cake. I had the one in Cafe Sacher, and had loved it. So I went to the other place, called Cafe Demel. It is situated in a very high-market street, with fashion labels dominating the shops. The cafe itself is very regal in atmosphere. The sachertorte, though good, was a bit drier than the one in Cafe Sacher, which I preferred more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thursday-26th\">Thursday 26th</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/vienna_cityline.jpg\"></p>\n<p>This day marked the Austrian National Day, and was therefore a holiday for all of Austria. People were out on the streets, though not celebrating explicitly as such (there was no flag waving or chants for that matter) but you could see them enjoying the national <em>holiday</em>. The grounds near the parliament had the traditional march where the military had set up their vehicles and tanks and helicopters. There was a huge crowd gathered around this place. The national museums were either free (to enter) or had reduced tickets for the day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"national-library\">National Library</h3>\n<p>We went to the national library, where the immensely beautiful collection of books and architecture was amazing and reminded us of the Trinity Library (long room). While the others went off to see the house of Mozart, I had to excuse myself to keep my reservation at Figlmuller.</p>\n<h3 id=\"figlmuller\">Figlmuller</h3>\n<p>The one other thing on my mental palate about Vienna other than sachertorte has been the wiener schnitzel at Figlmuller. Yes, it's a big place now, and as with all big places, they will not have an authentic personal touch to every dish served. But it's ridiculously famous for its dish, and I wanted to try and see it. After much asking around (if they wanted to come too) and trying to get a table (reservations are small), I managed to get one this afternoon.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/schnitzel.jpg\"></p>\n<p>There are several Figlmuller restaurants, though they all are around each other. They just exist to seat people. I was seated upstairs in one, and ordered the Figlmuller Schnitzel, their famous signature dish. I also ordered a side of fried potato and sparkling white wine with apricot nectar. The wine was very refreshing. When the dish arrived, it filled the plate completely. The bit of lemon on top adds to the taste and is there for a reason. I found myself enjoying the simple taste of this dish and wishing I could come again there a lot of times. All this while I had my first few bites. I hope I can eat such nice food again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"schonbrunn-palance\">Schonbrunn Palance</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/schonbrunn_palace.jpg\"></p>\n<p>After filling my stomach with delicious food, I went to see the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nbrunn_Palace\">Schonbrunn Palance</a>. I took the metro to the station named Schonbrunn, and then it was a short walk to the palace. It is immense, and it was full of tourists, which dampened my moods a bit. The tickets to see the various things were very confusing, and there was no indication of what I was actually paying for. I got tickets for  the palace tour, the garden, and the maze. I quickly covered all three by myself. The maze was especially fun, but too easy somehow.  I was tired from all the walking around and heavy lunch, so I made short of my stay, didn't take any pictures, and headed back to the hostel and just crashed on the bed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"friday-27th\">Friday 27th</h2>\n<p>This was the last day in Vienna. We had breakfast in the hostel and then left for Bratislava. We got a cheap deal for 5\u20ac which wasn't bad at all. It took us about 1hr 20mins (the bus first went to Vienna airport). </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Read more about my stay in Bratislava <a href=\"https://harshp.com/blog/series/places/bratislava/\">here</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"after-thoughts\">After-thoughts</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Vienna is really a great city to live in</li>\n<li>I like how efficient everything is, especially the transport</li>\n<li>Cakes!</li>\n<li>Such cultured society, and it mixes tradition with modernism well</li>\n<li>Food!</li>\n<li>I could want to be a postdoc at WU</li>\n</ul>", "body": "The [International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC)](https://iswc2017.semanticweb.org/) took me to Vienna, where I had to present a paper in the workshop on [Privacy Online (PrivOn)](http://privon.semanticweb.org/). The (few) perks of academia provided me with transport, accommodation, and food costs while the conference was on, which is 21st to 25th October. I was there a day earlier, 20th being Friday, and left early morning the week after, on 27th Friday for Bratislava (see [here](https://harshp.com/blog/series/places/bratislava/) for the blog post for Bratislava). In total, there were 7 of us (from the same research group - ADAPT, from Trinity College Dublin), including my Supervisor / PI / Guide.\r\n\r\n[Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna) is a city with a distinct culture due to being part and capital of the [Austro-Hungarian empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary) until World War I. It has a lot of significance in terms of culture due to the presence of several distinct artists in the areas of painting and music. It is also the city where Sigmund Freud resided. All of these have had significant impact on the city by forming part of its identity.\r\n\r\n>  In Vienna, the city itself is referred to as *Wien*, and everything from Wien is called _Wiener_. German (its dialect) is the official language, though a large population also speaks English.\r\n\r\n## Friday 20th\r\n\r\n### DUB --> VIE\r\n\r\nMy flight from Dublin was from 11:55, and it took about 02:15hrs to reach Vienna. I was flying with Aer Lingus, which meant that service was better (than RyanAir) though I made the mistake of asking for tea on-board. I was busy in reading, and habitually said I'd like a cup of tea (please!) and was handed one with a prompt inquiry about how much I owed (a few euros I think). Thankfully, I had a few coins with me. Flying was okay, just travel. The seats were comfortable and I finished the book I was reading - [The Old Man and The Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea) and started another - [The God of Small Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_of_Small_Things). \r\n\r\nOnce at Vienna, the airport style caught my attention. The airport was vividly decorated to portray everything Vienna had to offer - it's art, music, food. It looked like old culture being caught in a modern, sleek bottle. I liked this merging of the two. At the airport, the walls and the aisles were decorated with the attractions in Vienna. Paintings of [Gustav Klimt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Klimt), [Tower of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel), and even a food item  - the famous dish served by [Figlmuller](https://www.figlmueller.at/en/).\r\n\r\nWe went to the city via a 6-person taxi. Our hotels were quite close to the conference center - situated in WU (Vienna University of Economics and Business). \r\n\r\n### Accommodation\r\n\r\nISWC had partnered with a few hotels, and we (me and two colleagues, one of whom also bought a friend along) ended up booking at the one of the last available ones - Hotel Ibis Budget, situated in Messe - Wien.\r\n\r\nOnce at the hotel, we discovered a disastrous goof-up: our accommodation was not paid for. Now, our research group does this using a travel agency and they apparently had an issue where the credit card they used went over the limit and was declined. While that was being sorted, we managed to get one room, dumped all our luggage there. The rooms in this hotel are _budget_ to the highest degree. Everything is covered in cheap plastic paint, and the entire room is just _one_ room. The shower is situated without any separation, with the toilet being in a closet or sorts. There's a basin besides the shower, and the only light in the room is situated on top of this arrangement. At the other end of the room is a TV mounted in the corner. There is a double bed in between, with a chair and stool besides it. Everything looks _minimally_ functional, and uncomfortable. Not a cheerful thought to know that I would be staying there for about 6 days.\r\n\r\nKnowing all of this, and putting our luggage away for the moment, we decided to go to the city, get something to eat, have a look around, and hoped that when we got back, everything would be sorted.\r\n\r\n![The beautiful buildings of Vienna](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/vienna_museums_4.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Wiener Linien\r\n\r\nThe underground / metro / trains in Wien are run by a company called _Wiener Linien_ which means _Wien Lines_ (or something similar). The transport system is famous for its efficiency and for connecting all parts of Wien. There are several lines, colored such as Red, Green, Orange, and Brown that run on different paths. Tickets can be bought as all-you-can-travel passes for 24 to 72 hours. We bought these for us as traveling via the underground / metro is the best way to travel around.\r\n\r\n###  Messe-Prater\r\n\r\nWe started from the station called Messe-Prater, which, translates (in a completely amateur way) to  fair or exhibition (says Google Translate) and [Prater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prater) is a large park in the area. In the coming days, this would be one of our common go-to points for transport, since it was convenient for everyone, and also the closest stop for the conference.\r\n\r\n### Schottenring\r\n\r\nWe got off the train at _Schottenring_ and randomly walked about. We marveled at the facade of the buildings and how everything seemed _different_ and full of _culture_. People dressed nicer, and every building was beautiful. We walked and walked. And finally came across a restaurant called Vapiano (which is actually a chain-restaurant, but I did not know this at the time) and had dinner there. I ordered lasagna, because I like it, and because I wanted to taste it. It was good, but not exceedingly so. I put it down at the moment to perhaps lasagna being just a generic dish. Later, I attributed it to the non-specialty of the restaurant.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, we walked across the city on the stone streets with our eyes upwards on the buildings and the many facades it had. Statues and sigils and symbols were embossed, engraved, and hung everywhere. It gave it a bizarre modern rendition of older architecture. The rendition of fashion and art in the glass windows by the street gave the entire area an aura of elegance. \r\n\r\n### St. Stephen's Cathedral\r\n\r\nContinuing walking, we found ourselves suddenly in the presence of a huge cathedral - [St. Stephen's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Stephen%27s_Cathedral,_Vienna) - and it was amazing and impressive. The cathedral has two towers - the north and the south, with the northern tower being incomplete. The southern tower rises an impressive height and used to serve as a watchtower. The inside of the cathedral reflects the large size of the building with empty space lending an atmosphere of austerity.\r\n\r\n![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/vienna_carriage.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Das Loft\r\n\r\nWe walked to the river [Danube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube), which runs through Vienna, and is famous from the [waltz by Johann Strauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Danube) (the starting song in 2001: A Space Odessey). On the other side of the river is a sky-bar called _Das Loft_ considered one of the very high-class and famous bars in Vienna. We went there, and were asked to wait. And then asked to wait some more. Finally, it was let known, that we didn't have the required dress (or fashion sense) and maybe if we went back home, and dressed up a bit, we could try again. This was all done politely, and reflected the status of the place. Naturally, we wanted what we could not have even more.\r\n\r\n### Pubs in Vienna\r\n\r\nAfter the denied entry in Das Loft, we walked around till we found a pub, or a place to have a drink. Once I entered the place, I was perplexed by the lack of _choice_ when it came to beers. This is because Irish pubs have several options just on tap, and there's more in bottles and other places. Here beer is just _beer_ and everything else comes in a bottle. The local variety is a light, slightly sweet and mild lager, and is tasty and well suited to the autumn weather.\r\n\r\nSitting in the pub, I watched the place across through the window, where a house-party or gathering seemed to be in progress. People clustered into groups, and smoked, clutching their wine glasses. Vienna does not have a law prohibiting smoking indoors and in public places. This means that people smoke everywhere. This makes it somewhat annoying, though there are newer places that have started being exclusively non-smoking.\r\n\r\nAfter the drink, I went back to the hotel. The conference had been kind and organized enough to send my registration and goodies bag to the hotel, and I picked that up from the reception on the way up. I slept after the tiring first day.\r\n\r\n## Saturday 21st\r\n\r\n### Breakfast\r\n\r\nThe hotel provided breakfast for 7\u20ac, which is quite expensive. Breakfast all over Vienna (in hostels and such) is bread/toast, ham, salami, cheese, yogurt, cereals, eggs, veggies or salads, orange juice, and coffee. It is a good breakfast, but does not live up to the city's addiction to taste in food. Nevertheless, I had breakfast and went to the conference center.\r\n\r\n### WU\r\n\r\n![My ISWC conference badge and a complimentary USB drive with all the program and papers on it.](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/ISWC_ID.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe first two days of the conference were allocated to all the workshops. These took place in the Teaching Center at the far end of the university. Walking through the campus, the buildings were all modern and designed quite differently. The inside of the teaching center was spacious and well planned.\r\n\r\nThere were several coffee breaks in between the sessions, and lunch after noon. There was lemon and mint flavored water, which I found to be quite tasty. The lunch was the best I had at a conference or a gathering (venue). It had some of Vienna's delicacies. The desserts at the end were good too.\r\n\r\nAfter the first day of workshop sessions, I went back to the hotel, and simply fell into a nap. The next day being my presentation, I wanted to finish some work for it and rehearse. So I stayed at the hotel while others went out to explore the city. \r\n\r\n### Wiener Schnitzel\r\n\r\nAfter waking up from the nap, I decided to go to a nearby cafe so as to save time and get back to work. I found a decent cafe (_decent reviews_) called Moziak and went there. I had the famous Wiener [Schnitzel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnitzel) which is a thin piece of meat that is fried. I ordered the pork variety rather than the veal. The meal came with finger chips and salad. I also had a glass of wine. The meat was fried lightly but still retained its distinct taste. It was good. I couldn't wait to try this dish in a good place that has prepared it well. For that, I had set my sight on Figlmuller.\r\n\r\n### Prater\r\n\r\n![The beautiful buildings of Vienna](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/riesenrad.jpg)\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, I walked around the Prater area, mostly exploring the place and the streets. I found a lot of cafes there, probably because of the proximity with the park. I also found a lot of places with bizarre red-blue lighting displayed prominently on their doors and windows. I found out later that these are sex-related establishments and prostitution is legal in Vienna. In fact, it is quite famous in Europe for this, after Amsterdam and Germany. These places are usually isolated, well marked, and therefore are never a problem to anyone.\r\n\r\nI later went back to the hotel, worked on my presentation the next day, and then had a good sleep.\r\n\r\n## Sunday 22nd\r\n\r\nThis was the day of _my_ presentation. I had breakfast at the hotel, and ensured that I was well fed. My usual routine is to not eat anything until I've given my presentation because I believe it makes me lazy and lethargic and I am not able to  present it with passion or a high level of energy. However, this time, I wanted to make sure I was not hungry in the afternoon, and wanted to be able to focus on the presentation when the time came. If needed, I would have had some coffee.\r\n\r\n### Privacy Online Workshop\r\n\r\nI was to give a presentation on my paper at the Privacy Online workshop, which focused on specific aspects of privacy and security. My topic was about GDPR, the new regulation to be enforced next year that would change how companies collect, use, and share data. My PhD research is in documenting the provenance of activities as they happen and use data, and to find ways to prove or identify their compliance with this law. I was anxious to see what the community makes of my work.\r\n\r\nThe room the workshop was to be held in was a presentation room. It had the projector and screen centered in the room. Around it were two layers of tables and chair in a square fashion. It was effective and everyone could see everyone. I could see people walk in, and recognizing the who's who of the field, experts whose name I had only read in papers made me feel a little intimidated. Presenting my work to _these_ people, who all seemed to know each other in well-enough friendly terms made me a little scared. I wasn't nervous about presenting - I have no trouble with that - but I was more aware that this is an _opportunity_ and therefore it was _important_.\r\n\r\nDave, who is my main supervisor (PI or guide in some places) was there as well, to present another paper from the same research project. I relied on him to make certain concepts clear and to provide the motivation for why we were targeting that particular law. The fact that the organizer and some people in the room also had research interests in GDPR made me a little confident about presenting there. My presentation was after Dave's, which meant that I could rely on some things being already made clear. This made my job easier as I only had to focus on my part. So I went in there, and I gave the presentation. I didn't have a timer, but I seemed to do well on time.\r\n\r\nAfter the presentation, no one really had any questions, so I'm not sure whether that was good or bad. But the organizer(s) asked a few good questions. She (the main organizer) also spoke about collaboration as she is working on the same area as well. It was a good experience. I also had some of my colleagues present in the room, and I think it encouraged me to some extent. \r\n\r\nI attended the workshop until the last session, which ended in the evening. After that I had to go to the hotel and change for the conference dinner.\r\n\r\n### Dinner at Rathaus\r\n\r\n![The city hall was lavish and beautiful](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/city_hall_dinner.jpg)\r\n\r\nWe were to have dinner at the Vienna City Hall at Rathaus (that's also the name of the metro station) courtesy of the conference. I freshened up and made my way there.\r\n\r\nThe hall itself is impressive in its architecture. There was wine and beer being handed out. Finger food (_dinner_) had a queue as is the custom and necessity of conferences. There was a live band though I don't think the Blue Danube was being played by them. Later, there were dances, and I remember them as - Waltz, Samba, Rumba, Cha cha cha, and Jive. \r\n\r\nWe had a dinner, a few conversations, and then made our way out to a pub which was quite a (_post-dinner_) walk. Sadly, it turned out that the pub was closed. We continued our walk towards the city.\r\n\r\n### Cafe Mozart\r\n\r\nWe went to Cafe Mozart (which is one of the places where people go have cakes) and I had the mini trio - which had three mini cakes of sachertorte, mozarttorte, and heimbeer-topfen. All three were best, though I found the famous sachertorte to be rather dry and unimpressive. My favorite of the three was the mozarttorte. I also had hot chocolate with it. Vienna meant I was hogging at least 10 desserts everyday. And I'm not joking, I was really eating a lot of sugar. As I said to one of my friends - **Vienna = no rules**.\r\n\r\n## Monday 23rd\r\n\r\nThis was the first day of the conference, as the other days were for the workshops. I had a leisurely sleep and made my way to the Wien Messe Congress Convention Center - an impressive building that is large and very accommodating. There were several parallel sessions in progress throughout the day, and one could move between them as needed. Coffee breaks every few hours meant we could talk and network. Lunch was served in the big room (I think which could also be expanded to create a _bigger_ presentation place) and it was as impressive as ever.  Dessert was a berry mousse which I loved and gorged on.\r\n\r\n### City Center Random Walk\r\n\r\nAfter the conference, me and a colleague went to the city center to walk around rather aimlessly wherever the fancy took us. My only aim for the day was to eat the sacahertorte at the place famous for it - [Cafe Sacher](https://www.sacher.com/en/original-sacher-cake/sacher-cafe/). We decided to have that after dinner. However, with our random walks, we couldn't find and agree on a place to have dinner. And it started to be a bit annoying as both of us were quite hungry and also had to pee.\r\n\r\n![A random painting in the bathroom](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/bathroom_painting.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Italian Cuisine\r\n\r\nWe found an Italian place at the corner, and just walked in. It looked a bit small and cramped but there was a staircase that led upstairs. Once up, the place was quite large, and there was a crowd. It was a bit expensive, but the food was prepared well and with a certain subtlety. I had the tortellini made with spinach and it was excellent with a very subtle taste and excellent flavor. I had red wine (which I think went well with it).\r\n\r\n### Sachertorte\r\n\r\nOnce dinner was had, we walked over to Cafe Sacher, found it to be very luxurious (_posh!_) and were treated with utmost politeness and courtesy. I ordered the sachertorte and a hot chocolate. It came in. I ate it. I was pure bliss. The taste was _very very good_. So good, that I had to say, \"_shut up, let me eat this\". The layered chocolate cake is filled with two layers of apricot jam which balances itself against the dryness. It is an excellent balanced taste.\r\n\r\nAfter that, with me completely sated mind, body and soul, we went back to the hotel where I proceeded to read and sleep.\r\n\r\n## Tuesday 24th\r\n\r\n###  North Tower\r\n\r\nThis was another day where I went to the conference, had lunch, attended a few sessions. In the afternoon, about three of us snuck out to go explore the city. We went to St. Stephen's Cathedral to go up the tower. It cost us 4.50\u20ac and we had to suffer climbing extremely narrow, claustrophobic, winding stairs right up to the top. I couldn't believe I paid money to torture myself. I also realized how out of shape I was. The view from the top was nice.\r\n\r\n![The beautiful buildings of Vienna](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/vienna_museums_5.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Cafe Central\r\n\r\nAfter the (_fiasco_) of the stairs, we headed to [Cafe Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_Central) which is rather famous for being frequented by prominent personalities such as Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Adolf Hitler, Stalin, Trotsky, and so on. I had a [Wiener Melange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_Melange) which is the special coffee from Vienna. It was subtle and tasty (which all of Vienna is, I think). A colleague ordered the peanut and caramel cake (_snickers!_) and it was very tasty. Cakes are a specialty of Vienna. After this, we went to the nearest metro station and were back at the conference venue.\r\n\r\n###  Heuriger Fuhrgassl-Huber\r\n\r\nThe gala dinner was at [Heuriger Fuhrgassl-Huber](http://www.fuhrgassl-huber.at/), which is a famous vineyard in Vienna. It makes white wine from locally grown grapes (Vienna does not produce any red). From the conference venue, we had buses arranged to take us there and back, which was very convenient. The dinner was a buffet, with a whole roast hog available as well. The food was nice, though everything got over pretty quick and I could not go for seconds. The wine (produced at the vineyard itself) was light and sweet and was mildly acidic. We sat, ate, drank, chatted, and then went back.\r\n\r\n## Wednesday 25th\r\n\r\nThis was the last day of the conference. I packed my bags, checked out of the hotel, and went to the conference venue. I was there until lunch, after which, I left for the hostel I was to stay at. This required me to take a train and then switch to another line which actually went somewhere near the hostel. I had at first thought that traveling with a small suitcase would be an issue, but it was not hassle at all.\r\n\r\n### Wombat Hostels\r\n\r\nWe had a booking at Wombat hostels, which have a good rating for their cleanliness and ordered stays. The one we (me and a colleague) were booked in was situated in [Naschmarkt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naschmarkt) which is a popular local market, sort of like a farmer's market, but the stalls are more like shops here. The hostel itself was nice. It was the first time where I had to put on the bed sheet, put on the duvet cover, put on the pillow cover, and then take them all out and hand them over when checking out. But everything else was very well organized and straight-forward. Our keys were key-cards, and our lockers could only be opened _and_ closed using the key-cards.\r\n\r\n### Naschmarkt\r\n\r\n![The market houses several stalls stretched out for nearly a kilometer](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/vienna_naschmarkt2.jpg)\r\n\r\nOnce I was settled in, freshened up, and ready to go out, I explored the Naschmarkt. I walked from start to end and could see the _cheap_ shops lined up offering all kinds of whacky things. It was mostly the _immigrants_ who were manning the shops and the restaurants. As I was walking past, I hard shouts of \"_shahrukh khan... shahrukh khan..._\" and it took me a while to realize that they were directed at me. I turned back and it were the women in the stall behind, with the one going \"..._shahrukh khan?_\" with a questioning, almost hopeful look in her eyes. I laughed and said no, but thank you for thinking I am.\r\n\r\n### History of Torture Museum\r\n\r\nAfter that market, I walked to the torture museum. I was curious what it was. The ticket was only 4.50\u20ac, which wasn't that bad. There were several exhibits inside ranging from witch-burning to more recent examples of prisoners in prisons of more developed countries. The museum states its goal to be awareness of torture and that it is vehemently opposed to torture itself.\r\n\r\n### Museumsquartier\r\n\r\n[Museumsquartier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museumsquartier) is filled with Museums (as the name says), and also contains the parliament square. I spend my time traveling around the area until I was finally tired enough, after which I walked over to the city center.\r\n\r\n![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/vienna_museums4.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Cafe Alt Wien\r\n\r\nFor dinner, I went to Cafe Alt Wien, which is situated in a tucked away street and is fairly inconspicuous about its presence. Inside though, the art is well laid (_Vienna!_) and the food is good. I ordered a wiener melange and a frankfurter.\r\n\r\n### Cafe Demel\r\n\r\nThere was a court case as to the origins of the sachertorte. There's quite a bit of history there. Read it up on the internet. To put it shortly, the final version of the cake was made at Cafe Demel by the successor of the inventor. Therefore, there are two _official_ versions of the cake. I had the one in Cafe Sacher, and had loved it. So I went to the other place, called Cafe Demel. It is situated in a very high-market street, with fashion labels dominating the shops. The cafe itself is very regal in atmosphere. The sachertorte, though good, was a bit drier than the one in Cafe Sacher, which I preferred more.\r\n\r\n## Thursday 26th\r\n\r\n![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/vienna_cityline.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis day marked the Austrian National Day, and was therefore a holiday for all of Austria. People were out on the streets, though not celebrating explicitly as such (there was no flag waving or chants for that matter) but you could see them enjoying the national _holiday_. The grounds near the parliament had the traditional march where the military had set up their vehicles and tanks and helicopters. There was a huge crowd gathered around this place. The national museums were either free (to enter) or had reduced tickets for the day.\r\n\r\n### National Library\r\n\r\nWe went to the national library, where the immensely beautiful collection of books and architecture was amazing and reminded us of the Trinity Library (long room). While the others went off to see the house of Mozart, I had to excuse myself to keep my reservation at Figlmuller.\r\n\r\n### Figlmuller\r\n\r\nThe one other thing on my mental palate about Vienna other than sachertorte has been the wiener schnitzel at Figlmuller. Yes, it's a big place now, and as with all big places, they will not have an authentic personal touch to every dish served. But it's ridiculously famous for its dish, and I wanted to try and see it. After much asking around (if they wanted to come too) and trying to get a table (reservations are small), I managed to get one this afternoon.\r\n\r\n![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/schnitzel.jpg)\r\n\r\nThere are several Figlmuller restaurants, though they all are around each other. They just exist to seat people. I was seated upstairs in one, and ordered the Figlmuller Schnitzel, their famous signature dish. I also ordered a side of fried potato and sparkling white wine with apricot nectar. The wine was very refreshing. When the dish arrived, it filled the plate completely. The bit of lemon on top adds to the taste and is there for a reason. I found myself enjoying the simple taste of this dish and wishing I could come again there a lot of times. All this while I had my first few bites. I hope I can eat such nice food again.\r\n\r\n### Schonbrunn Palance\r\n\r\n![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/schonbrunn_palace.jpg)\r\n\r\nAfter filling my stomach with delicious food, I went to see the [Schonbrunn Palance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nbrunn_Palace). I took the metro to the station named Schonbrunn, and then it was a short walk to the palace. It is immense, and it was full of tourists, which dampened my moods a bit. The tickets to see the various things were very confusing, and there was no indication of what I was actually paying for. I got tickets for  the palace tour, the garden, and the maze. I quickly covered all three by myself. The maze was especially fun, but too easy somehow.  I was tired from all the walking around and heavy lunch, so I made short of my stay, didn't take any pictures, and headed back to the hostel and just crashed on the bed.\r\n\r\n## Friday 27th\r\n\r\nThis was the last day in Vienna. We had breakfast in the hostel and then left for Bratislava. We got a cheap deal for 5\u20ac which wasn't bad at all. It took us about 1hr 20mins (the bus first went to Vienna airport). \r\n\r\n> Read more about my stay in Bratislava [here](https://harshp.com/blog/series/places/bratislava/)\r\n\r\n## After-thoughts\r\n\r\n* Vienna is really a great city to live in\r\n* I like how efficient everything is, especially the transport\r\n* Cakes!\r\n* Such cultured society, and it mixes tradition with modernism well\r\n* Food!\r\n* I could want to be a postdoc at WU", "headerimage": "https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/blog/travels/vienna-bratislava/vienna_museums_6.jpg", "highlight": "1", "series": 15}, {"id": 75, "title": "Workaholic - don't be working full time", "authors": "1", "date_created": "2017-10-08 21:39:28", "date_published": "2017-10-08 21:39:29", "date_updated": "2017-10-08 21:49:20", "is_published": "1", "short_description": "Working without indulging the other things I want to do is being an workaholic", "tags": "197,48,72", "slug": "workaholic-dont-be-working-full-time", "body_type": "markdown", "body_text": "<p>So here I was, sitting in the PhD office space, 9pm on a Sunday, working on some minor work in preparation for the coming week. Yeah, the usual \"I have no life\", \"weekends are meant to be for fun\", and all the other excuses or reasons or judgments or opinions or whatever. Fact was, I was enjoying being there. I did not feel stressed or pressured to have completed work. I was there by my own choice. But still, at the back of my mind, the things I wanted to do, which were non-work, were still nagging me. Things like reading the last book in The Three Body Problem trilogy. Or watching films by a director called Pedro Almod\u00f3var. Or playing Don't Starve. Or learning Haskell. And every time I have these thoughts, I always justify them saying the work I'm doing now is more important. I'll do them later when I'm a little more free. And now I've realised that I keep saying this over and over and over again.</p>\n<p>It's not like I do not have 'fun'. I like my work. I'm excited about it. I work with vigour and passion. So I'm not in an escapist situation where the moment I start doing work, all I'm thinking about is when I'm going to finish it and how I'll relax later on or what I'm going to do this weekend. But this tendency to be a workaholic has made me not indulge into other things I like to do.</p>\n<p>I watch a film now and then. I read immensely. Sometimes as much as finishing a book a week. There are good metrics - both quantitatively and qualitatively. But I still want more. And this wanting more cannot come unless I reduce work to make time for doing this stuff. So here I am in a dilemma, thinking whether I should cut down on work or whether I should carry on working.</p>\n<p>There's no clear answer, and anything you have got in <em>your</em> head right is <em>your</em> opinion. What I did was to ask myself what I wanted to achieve 1 month later, or 1 year later. Is that 1 hour I put in everyday, or the work that I do every weekend going to matter in the long run? Am I spending 20% extra time for 2% gains? Is that rational? It is nearly impossible to quantify these things like this. But it at least got me thinking on something more important.</p>\n<p>At the end of the year, what do I want to <em>have done</em>. Like a list of achievements I can look at and say, yes, I wanted to do this, and I have done it. This is what I had started Life Experiments for. But I stopped them. So here I am wondering the same things again and again in life. I'm sure this is a pattern as well.</p>\n<p>So here's the conclusion I came to - work <em>smarter</em> and indulge in other things. The PhD work should not be the <em>only</em> skill I have at the end of four years. That's <em>practical</em> advice. If I'm spending 10 hours working, I'm actually only working for 4 hours. Maybe 5 if I'm being generous about myself. The rest of the time, I'm doing -\n * wondering what to do next\n * spending way more time on trivial 1% stuff\n * bored and working more slowly\n * going on a tangent to non-related stuff\n * finding something that <em>feels</em> more exciting at the moment and working on that</p>\n<p>All this makes me wonder if I'm just wasting time. Do I ever finish what I started? Or do I keep going off on tangents for so long that I'm never finished? Is that why I work so much? Because I keep finding something new to chase around? Am I an academic puppy?</p>\n<p>I want to be a smart worker. So I'm going to <em>plan</em> for the foreseeable future, and stick to it in terms of achievements. I've got a nice quote on a note on my desk -</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you're not finishing, you're just busy, not productive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Make a list, breakdown stuff, and plan the crap out of it. But don't plan too close to the edges. Just know the next steps. And then do them for the day. When you're finished, or even if you're not, drop them. Move on to the next one. Or to the hobbies thing you wanted to do. I think this way, it makes working more intense because you're literally yearning (PhD life!) to go back to work. At the same time, it scratches the itch of having done your hobbies things too.</p>", "body": "So here I was, sitting in the PhD office space, 9pm on a Sunday, working on some minor work in preparation for the coming week.

I did not feel stressed or pressured to have completed work. I was there by my own choice. But still, at the back of my mind, the things I wanted to do, which were non-work, were still nagging me. Things like reading the last book in The Three Body Problem trilogy. Or watching films by a director called Pedro Almod\u00f3var. Or playing Don't Starve. Or learning Haskell. And every time I have these thoughts, I always justify them saying the work I'm doing now is more important. I'll do them later when I'm a little more free. And now I've realised that I keep saying this over and over and over again.\r\n\r\nIt's not like I do not have 'fun'. I like my work. I'm excited about it. I work with vigour and passion. So I'm not in an escapist situation where the moment I start doing work, all I'm thinking about is when I'm going to finish it and how I'll relax later on or what I'm going to do this weekend. But this tendency to be a workaholic has made me not indulge into other things I like to do.\r\n\r\nI watch a film now and then. I read immensely. Sometimes as much as finishing a book a week. There are good metrics - both quantitatively and qualitatively. But I still want more. And this wanting more cannot come unless I reduce work to make time for doing this stuff. So here I am in a dilemma, thinking whether I should cut down on work or whether I should carry on working.\r\n\r\nThere's no clear answer, and anything you have got in _your_ head right is _your_ opinion. What I did was to ask myself what I wanted to achieve 1 month later, or 1 year later. Is that 1 hour I put in everyday, or the work that I do every weekend going to matter in the long run? Am I spending 20% extra time for 2% gains? Is that rational? It is nearly impossible to quantify these things like this. But it at least got me thinking on something more important.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year, what do I want to _have done_. Like a list of achievements I can look at and say, yes, I wanted to do this, and I have done it. This is what I had started Life Experiments for. But I stopped them. So here I am wondering the same things again and again in life. I'm sure this is a pattern as well.\r\n\r\nSo here's the conclusion I came to - work _smarter_ and indulge in other things. The PhD work should not be the _only_ skill I have at the end of four years. That's _practical_ advice. If I'm spending 10 hours working, I'm actually only working for 4 hours. Maybe 5 if I'm being generous about myself. The rest of the time, I'm doing -\r\n * wondering what to do next\r\n * spending way more time on trivial 1% stuff\r\n * bored and working more slowly\r\n * going on a tangent to non-related stuff\r\n * finding something that _feels_ more exciting at the moment and working on that\r\n\r\nAll this makes me wonder if I'm just wasting time. Do I ever finish what I started? Or do I keep going off on tangents for so long that I'm never finished? Is that why I work so much? Because I keep finding something new to chase around? Am I an academic puppy?\r\n\r\nI want to be a smart worker. So I'm going to _plan_ for the foreseeable future, and stick to it in terms of achievements. I've got a nice quote on a note on my desk -\r\n> If you're not finishing, you're just busy, not productive.\r\n\r\nMake a list, breakdown stuff, and plan the crap out of it. But don't plan too close to the edges. Just know the next steps. And then do them for the day. When you're finished, or even if you're not, drop them. Move on to the next one. Or to the hobbies thing you wanted to do. I think this way, it makes working more intense because you're literally yearning (PhD life!) to go back to work. At the same time, it scratches the itch of having done your hobbies things too.", "headerimage": "", "highlight": "1", "series": 9}, {"id": 74, "title": "Lord of the Flies", "authors": "1", "date_created": "2017-10-02 16:30:36", "date_published": "2017-10-02 16:30:37", "date_updated": "2017-10-02 16:41:56", "is_published": "1", "short_description": "What happens when a group of young boys are stranded on an island?", "tags": "195", "slug": "lord-of-the-flies", "body_type": "markdown", "body_text": "<p>This is an iconic novel.

That order is important, in part because it is more about him conveying something rather than giving shape to an existing idea. The film offers no helping hand, but none is needed as the narrative is completely linear. To compensate, there is no indication of either the past or the reasons for what is happening on screen. The characters, each wrapped in their own shroud of mysterious origins, are introduced without any fanfare, and the entire story is hinged on finding familiarity in the biblical tales. The film is heavy on allegory, and comes as an essential counterpart to the Old Testament. Without giving away spoilers, the film is heavy on biblical themes. It can be claustrophobic for some, and too violent for others. But it is refined, as every scene and progression is measured to induce the cluelessness, hopefulness, and the feeling of being closed upon from all sides is imparted on the viewer. It is a film that is meant to be understood, and then ruminated upon as one leaves the cinema. It's a must watch from my mind.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>spoilers ahead </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The film is heavy on biblical allegory. Things such as the cycle of life, or the writings of God are depicted in quite a literal fashion. We have God,  as Him in the credits, who creates everything, and mother in a paradise which is the house itself. We are constantly shown how the mother and the house are one and the same, their hearts or life-forces are bound. In this paradise lives God, the creator, the poet, who has written a great work of art, but can write no more. Mother, who loves him to no end, even though he does not seem to pay her any mind, is taken up with finishing the house, making it the literal 'paradise'. This is the setting of the film.</p>\n<p>One day, a man turns up, thinking it's an Inn. Him, being as merciful as he is, takes him in. This is God created Man (see the credits, again). So God is happy with the company, and mother is worried. She does not like this stranger in to her house. But God like it, because Man is enamored with Him. There's something suspicious about him that she does not understand, and she wants him gone from her house. At this point, we are to be made clear that mother is Mother Earth, and the room in the house where Him 'creates' is the garden of Eden.</p>\n<p>We see Him and Man having a deep conversation in front of the crystal, and at night, when mother wakes up, she finds Man being sick in the bathroom, with Him taking care, and a nasty wound on his rib. That's the act of God taking Man's rib to create Woman.</p>\n<p>This Woman turns up the next day, and we are immediately shown how mother is jealous of the love between Man and Woman, and how God seems infatuated with them. As they stay, things get on her nerves. God is humoring them all the time, and this causes mother to be angry. She explains that he watched his 'mother' (which is a reference to her) burn in the house, and she helped him make it back to what it was. But all this has no effect, the only people who seem to enjoy are Man, Woman, and Him. She is left to wonder what they are doing, seemingly disturbing her peace.</p>\n<p>Woman is obsessed with the crystal, and in spite of being told to stay away from it, she sneaks in with Man, and causes it to shatter. God is angry, and he banishes them from the study and boards it up, saying they will never get in there again. This is Him casting Man and Woman from the heavens (they are literally upstairs in the house) and boarding it up.</p>\n<p>We now see Cain and Abel, the two sons, who turn up and fight. One brother murders the other. Completely biblical. As things go on, more people start pouring in, until one manages to break the plumbing, and we start seeing water everywhere as mother gets hysterical about her house. Then she gets everyone to leave. This is the flood that caused humanity to be cast out once more.</p>\n<p>Then we see Him and mother conceive a child. She 'knows' she is pregnant almost immediately, almost as if she always were. This gives God inspiration, and he starts writing again. This is the 'new' testament. When it is over, mother is overjoyed, for God has started creating again. However, she finds out that God has already 'published' the work, and that his 'publisher' has already read it well before her. The publisher is credited as the herald. That's the person 'God' speaks to. The prophet. Then we see people start coming in from far, while mother prepares a meal meant for Him.</p>\n<p>Finding out that everyone 'loves' him, God invites everyone in to the house and asks them to share. People start taking everything God has touched, wanting to get something of 'his'. Soon they start tearing up the house. This is the state of humanity. There are wars. People are executed in 'his' name. The interpreter of God's word, the prophet kills people in blasphemy or in the name of 'freeing' them. We see someone literally shooting people off. Even mother, as she stumbles in. But she manages to carry on, terrified as the world around her is plunged into a never ending war. </p>\n<p>Amidst all this, she is ready to deliver the child. The group of fanatics who have cornered and captured the stairs (literally the stairway to heaven), give the mother safe passage as God takes her upstairs. In there, she gives birth to her child, a son, and this is meant to be the Christ, Jesus himself. Mother begs Him to get those people 'out of her house', but God wants them to stay, even when they are tearing the house apart. That's the idea of a 'selfish' God that has pervaded so long, that God will love anything and everything because he wants love, he doesn't really care about anything and anyone as long as he is 'loved'.</p>\n<p>Mother is soon exhausted from staying up, and the people outside send her gifts - fruits and clothing, a clear allegory to the birth of baby Christ. Mother refuses to give Him the child, and clutches him in her arms. But soon she falls asleep from exhaustion, meanwhile God sits staring at her, never blinking, with his eternal look. The moment she falls asleep, he takes the baby from her.</p>\n<p>When she wakes up and finds the child gone, she knows this is to be done by Him, that he took the child outside. And this is true. As she steps outside, she sees him present the baby to the people, who worship him and chant for him. By the time she reaches Him, the child is gone. It's in crowd, as people pass him around. We hear someone snap the head, and mother frantically reaches the child. But it's already dead.</p>\n<p>Turning around, she sees people 'eat the flesh' and 'drink his blood', literally symbolic of the rituals followed by the catholic church. This drives her to the edge, and she threatens the world with her rage as she tears up the floors in her fury (she -is- the floors). People then call her names, trample on her, spit on her, hit her, beat her up. That's humanity's disdain of mother earth.</p>\n<p>In her fury, she fetches the lighter with a strange mark (or fire, another biblical or Hebrew reference) and takes it to the basement, where there's a huge store of oil. That's another interesting depiction - oil under the house. She sets the oil on fire, consuming everything. At the end, mother is barely alive, but badly burnt. Everyone else has been destroyed except Him. She wonders what else he wants, and we see the motto of 'selfish God' again as he says he wishes her love.

That order is important, in part because it is more about him conveying something rather than giving shape to an existing idea. The film offers no helping hand, but none is needed as the narrative is completely linear. To compensate, there is no indication of either the past or the reasons for what is happening on screen. The characters, each wrapped in their own shroud of mysterious origins, are introduced without any fanfare, and the entire story is hinged on finding familiarity in the biblical tales. The film is heavy on allegory, and comes as an essential counterpart to the Old Testament. Without giving away spoilers, the film is heavy on biblical themes. It can be claustrophobic for some, and too violent for others. But it is refined, as every scene and progression is measured to induce the cluelessness, hopefulness, and the feeling of being closed upon from all sides is imparted on the viewer. It is a film that is meant to be understood, and then ruminated upon as one leaves the cinema. It's a must watch from my mind.\r\n\r\n>  spoilers ahead \r\n\r\nThe film is heavy on biblical allegory. Things such as the cycle of life, or the writings of God are depicted in quite a literal fashion. We have God,  as Him in the credits, who creates everything, and mother in a paradise which is the house itself. We are constantly shown how the mother and the house are one and the same, their hearts or life-forces are bound. In this paradise lives God, the creator, the poet, who has written a great work of art, but can write no more. Mother, who loves him to no end, even though he does not seem to pay her any mind, is taken up with finishing the house, making it the literal 'paradise'. This is the setting of the film.\r\n\r\nOne day, a man turns up, thinking it's an Inn. Him, being as merciful as he is, takes him in. This is God created Man (see the credits, again). So God is happy with the company, and mother is worried. She does not like this stranger in to her house. But God like it, because Man is enamored with Him. There's something suspicious about him that she does not understand, and she wants him gone from her house. At this point, we are to be made clear that mother is Mother Earth, and the room in the house where Him 'creates' is the garden of Eden.\r\n\r\nWe see Him and Man having a deep conversation in front of the crystal, and at night, when mother wakes up, she finds Man being sick in the bathroom, with Him taking care, and a nasty wound on his rib. That's the act of God taking Man's rib to create Woman.\r\n\r\nThis Woman turns up the next day, and we are immediately shown how mother is jealous of the love between Man and Woman, and how God seems infatuated with them. As they stay, things get on her nerves. God is humoring them all the time, and this causes mother to be angry. She explains that he watched his 'mother' (which is a reference to her) burn in the house, and she helped him make it back to what it was. But all this has no effect, the only people who seem to enjoy are Man, Woman, and Him. She is left to wonder what they are doing, seemingly disturbing her peace.\r\n\r\nWoman is obsessed with the crystal, and in spite of being told to stay away from it, she sneaks in with Man, and causes it to shatter. God is angry, and he banishes them from the study and boards it up, saying they will never get in there again. This is Him casting Man and Woman from the heavens (they are literally upstairs in the house) and boarding it up.\r\n\r\nWe now see Cain and Abel, the two sons, who turn up and fight. One brother murders the other. Completely biblical. As things go on, more people start pouring in, until one manages to break the plumbing, and we start seeing water everywhere as mother gets hysterical about her house. Then she gets everyone to leave. This is the flood that caused humanity to be cast out once more.\r\n\r\nThen we see Him and mother conceive a child. She 'knows' she is pregnant almost immediately, almost as if she always were. This gives God inspiration, and he starts writing again. This is the 'new' testament. When it is over, mother is overjoyed, for God has started creating again. However, she finds out that God has already 'published' the work, and that his 'publisher' has already read it well before her. The publisher is credited as the herald. That's the person 'God' speaks to. The prophet. Then we see people start coming in from far, while mother prepares a meal meant for Him.\r\n\r\nFinding out that everyone 'loves' him, God invites everyone in to the house and asks them to share. People start taking everything God has touched, wanting to get something of 'his'. Soon they start tearing up the house. This is the state of humanity. There are wars. People are executed in 'his' name. The interpreter of God's word, the prophet kills people in blasphemy or in the name of 'freeing' them. We see someone literally shooting people off. Even mother, as she stumbles in. But she manages to carry on, terrified as the world around her is plunged into a never ending war. \r\n\r\nAmidst all this, she is ready to deliver the child. The group of fanatics who have cornered and captured the stairs (literally the stairway to heaven), give the mother safe passage as God takes her upstairs. In there, she gives birth to her child, a son, and this is meant to be the Christ, Jesus himself. Mother begs Him to get those people 'out of her house', but God wants them to stay, even when they are tearing the house apart. That's the idea of a 'selfish' God that has pervaded so long, that God will love anything and everything because he wants love, he doesn't really care about anything and anyone as long as he is 'loved'.\r\n\r\nMother is soon exhausted from staying up, and the people outside send her gifts - fruits and clothing, a clear allegory to the birth of baby Christ. Mother refuses to give Him the child, and clutches him in her arms. But soon she falls asleep from exhaustion, meanwhile God sits staring at her, never blinking, with his eternal look. The moment she falls asleep, he takes the baby from her.\r\n\r\nWhen she wakes up and finds the child gone, she knows this is to be done by Him, that he took the child outside. And this is true. As she steps outside, she sees him present the baby to the people, who worship him and chant for him. By the time she reaches Him, the child is gone. It's in crowd, as people pass him around. We hear someone snap the head, and mother frantically reaches the child. But it's already dead.\r\n\r\nTurning around, she sees people 'eat the flesh' and 'drink his blood', literally symbolic of the rituals followed by the catholic church. This drives her to the edge, and she threatens the world with her rage as she tears up the floors in her fury (she -is- the floors). People then call her names, trample on her, spit on her, hit her, beat her up. That's humanity's disdain of mother earth.\r\n\r\nIn her fury, she fetches the lighter with a strange mark (or fire, another biblical or Hebrew reference) and takes it to the basement, where there's a huge store of oil. That's another interesting depiction - oil under the house. She sets the oil on fire, consuming everything. At the end, mother is barely alive, but badly burnt. Everyone else has been destroyed except Him. She wonders what else he wants, and we see the motto of 'selfish God' again as he says he wishes her love. He then opens up her heart and takes out a crystal similar to the one in his study, implying that this has happened before. He puts up the crystal on the pedestal, and everything goes back to as it was at the start. We see a different mother wake up.\r\n\r\nThe only bits I'm still confused about are the potion that mother drinks every time she has a panic attack of sorts. It's all glittery and metallic. And after she gets pregnant, she throws the rest of it away. What was it?

It wasn\u2019t like I was scooped up in a cage like a chicken waiting until the next egg happened to fall out. I had a routine, I didn\u2019t waste much time, I played games, I watched stuff on Netflix, I went out, I watched films, and at the end of everything, I finished a few projects and successfully submitted a paper.

I wondered, quite a few times, why I\u2019m productive, but then decided not to pursue it right in the middle of deadlines. But now that I\u2019m free, I thought I\u2019d give this a thought and write down what I found.</p>\n<p>The first things I did was try to form a measure of whether I actually productive or just thinking that I had been productive. Thankfully, this was easy to reason about. Did I work all day long? No. Did I feel too tired to stand up and dance at the end of the day? No. Did I finish what I set out to do, in broader terms? Yes. Did I achieve something out of this? Yes. Was it accomplished to my taste, or was it wasteful and half baked? It was well done. So, yes, I had been productive. So far so good. Now to what I actually did all day. My routine started as I leisurely woke up. There was no fixed time, though the alarm combined with the sunlight coming through the window meant that I woke up anytime from 6am to 9am. If I felt like I hadn\u2019t had enough sleep, or if it was too early, I would laze about or have another few hours. At no point did I have excess sleep, or overslept. But I also never underslept, and that was important to stay active throughout the day.</p>\n<p>After waking up, I had a nice breakfast, mostly consisting of eggs. Now I was very conscious of what I was eating, in that I limited most intakes of sugar and processed food. Morning was eggs with tomato, garlic, onions, or chili tossed in. After that I munched on apples and bananas all day long as I worked. My theory is that eating a heavy or filling lunch or snack when working makes me sleepy, and therefore I get bored and don\u2019t work as well. Eating a fruit, on the other hand, provides easy energy that isn\u2019t heavy to digest, and more importantly, is absorbed and out of my stomach within the next two hours. This meant I could keep munching every now and then, which is great because it keeps a healthy supply of sugars and also helps with digestion moving along due to the fruits. I drank some tea, not a lot. I had one coffee a day, just the one.

Sometimes I started reading something randomly on Wikipedia or Pocket. It worked like a short break. At the end of it, I didn\u2019t have an excuse anymore to get back to work, and so I could outpour a few more paragraphs. At the end of the day, at around 8-10 hours, I would start feeling overwhelmed, at which point, no matter what I was doing, I got up and went home.

And so I managed to finish a little bit outside the office. I didn\u2019t depend on it though. </p>\n<p>In hindsight, what worked was the lack of a strict plan or routine.

To follow up this act and create\na <em>modern Doom</em> is a monumental task.</p>\n<p>The new Doom, released in 2016, stands true to its ancestor and expectations, delivering\na game that looks beautiful and a gameplay that stands true to its lineage of being <em>doom like</em>.\nSet on Mars, the game follows players as they move through UAC facility, and then through Hell.\nThe single player campaign lasts from 15 to 25 hours, though it felt quite short simply because\nI was having <em>immense</em> fun. The game is violent, especially the gory kills system which is\nthe backbone of the gameplay. Though I did not mind any bit of it, and actually thought it\nlooked really cool, and well executed. The monsters are still reminiscent of the original Doom,\nin that they have their own behaviors. There are a few new ones that keep things interesting,\nwith behavior that is different or reminiscent of the original.</p>\n<p>One of the best things about the game is its soundtrack - an amazing mix of metal and\nadrenaline pounding rhythm. With every fight, the soundtrack sets the tempo for the\nfast paced action, making the game feel very coherent and clear about things happening\non screen. The gameplay together with this feels rock solid - the areas are big\nenough to run around, but just small enough to never be out of the fight. Id have\nmanaged to blend in the just the right mix so well, that when it was quiet, I was wondering\nwhere everyone was and why there was no action happening. ACTION is DOOM.</p>\n<p>As with the new games, where health heals automatically after a while of not taking damage,\nDoom goes old school (which IMHO, is a <em>better</em> way to play). There are health drops\neverywhere and monsters drop health and ammo on glory kills. The game rewards risk taking\nand damage is just a side-effect as long as it does not kill you. Whenever in game I was\nconstrained by my health, I finished off the lesser demons and glory killed them to get\nsome instant health and it felt pretty well balanced. The difficulty is classic Doom.\nThe monsters are <em>tough</em>, and I loved the challenge. The monsters have no health bars,\nso one has to remember how many shotgun shots it takes to take them down.</p>\n<p>The multiplayer is as expected of the series - quick paced <em>Quake</em>-like. That being said,\nI found it to be a bit unpolished compared to the main game. All of the DLCs released are\nmultiplayer map packs, something that disappointed me. I wanted more campaign stuff.\nAs does a lot of the community. I wish Id listens to us and does release something soon.\nThe upcoming Doom VFR looks interesting too.</p>\n<p>All in all, Doom is a good game, \none that would stick for a long time in my library for that occasional play through.</p>", "body": "Doom's legacy is a huge journey that defined the gaming genre.\r\nThe [original Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)) was an iconic game\r\nthat set the scene for first-person-shooter (FPs) games.

To follow up this act and create\r\na *modern Doom* is a monumental task.\r\n\r\nThe new Doom, released in 2016, stands true to its ancestor and expectations, delivering\r\na game that looks beautiful and a gameplay that stands true to its lineage of being *doom like*.\r\nSet on Mars, the game follows players as they move through UAC facility, and then through Hell.\r\nThe single player campaign lasts from 15 to 25 hours, though it felt quite short simply because\r\nI was having *immense* fun. The game is violent, especially the gory kills system which is\r\nthe backbone of the gameplay. Though I did not mind any bit of it, and actually thought it\r\nlooked really cool, and well executed. The monsters are still reminiscent of the original Doom,\r\nin that they have their own behaviors. There are a few new ones that keep things interesting,\r\nwith behavior that is different or reminiscent of the original.\r\n\r\nOne of the best things about the game is its soundtrack - an amazing mix of metal and\r\nadrenaline pounding rhythm. With every fight, the soundtrack sets the tempo for the\r\nfast paced action, making the game feel very coherent and clear about things happening\r\non screen. The gameplay together with this feels rock solid - the areas are big\r\nenough to run around, but just small enough to never be out of the fight. Id have\r\nmanaged to blend in the just the right mix so well, that when it was quiet, I was wondering\r\nwhere everyone was and why there was no action happening. ACTION is DOOM.\r\n\r\nAs with the new games, where health heals automatically after a while of not taking damage,\r\nDoom goes old school (which IMHO, is a *better* way to play). There are health drops\r\neverywhere and monsters drop health and ammo on glory kills. The game rewards risk taking\r\nand damage is just a side-effect as long as it does not kill you. Whenever in game I was\r\nconstrained by my health, I finished off the lesser demons and glory killed them to get\r\nsome instant health and it felt pretty well balanced. The difficulty is classic Doom.\r\nThe monsters are *tough*, and I loved the challenge. The monsters have no health bars,\r\nso one has to remember how many shotgun shots it takes to take them down.\r\n\r\nThe multiplayer is as expected of the series - quick paced *Quake*-like. That being said,\r\nI found it to be a bit unpolished compared to the main game. All of the DLCs released are\r\nmultiplayer map packs, something that disappointed me. I wanted more campaign stuff.\r\nAs does a lot of the community. I wish Id listens to us and does release something soon.\r\nThe upcoming Doom VFR looks interesting too.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Doom is a good game, \r\none that would stick for a long time in my library for that occasional play through.", "headerimage": "", "highlight": "0", "series": 12}, {"id": 55, "title": "Just a minor setback", "authors": "1", "date_created": "2017-06-10 20:22:00", "date_published": "2017-06-10 20:22:00", "date_updated": "2017-06-10 22:02:54", "is_published": "1", "short_description": "The ordeal of waiting for my gaming PC and finding it doesn't work", "tags": "6,146,79", "slug": "just-a-minor-setback", "body_type": "markdown", "body_text": "<blockquote>\n<p>for details on specs,\nsee <a href=\"https://harshp.com/blog/series/gadgets/my-new-custom-built-gaming-pc/\">this</a> post</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"part-one-a-false-start\">Part One: A False Start</h2>\n<p>I ordered a custom built gaming PC, \nfrom <a href=\"https://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/\">pcspealist.co.uk</a> based on\nrecommendations from friends who had bought from them before.\nI expected it to be a source of joy (and\nprocrastination).

Due to my policy\nof not playing or not using the work laptop(s) for playing games,\nI decided to get a dedicated gaming PC instead. Something beefy\nenough to play all those nice-looking games.\nI had a little saved money from all the TA/demonstrating work I did\nover the past few months. And with a firm belief that I must do \n<em>something</em> with it, I decided to get a custom machine.</p>\n<p>Earlier ideas were around ordering all the parts myself and just \ntaking a weekend to build them together. This brought up thoughts\nabout the likelihood that I may\nnot take important compatibilities around, not to mention the\ncustomer service when something does eventually go wrong\nis a memorable experience for all the wrong reasons. I put up a\npost on Facebook about this, and friends (<em>thanks Gareth, Aaron, Tam!</em>)\nresponded about <a href=\"https://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/\">PCSpecialist</a>,\na UK based company that built custom PCs according to spec, and \noffered warranty and after-service. Okay, but what about the price\ndifference? Turns out that it was about a hundred or two more. I thought\nit was a good deal, considering I was going to get it shipped in one\npiece with the comfort of knowing that things will work together\nwell, and if they don't, I have a number to call.\nSo off I went to configure the beast of my gaming glory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-what\">The What</h2>\n<h3 id=\"processors\">Processors</h3>\n<p>Everyone knows Intel rules the processing kingdom with both hands\ntied behind its back. No matter what AMD does, and sometimes it\ndoes things that are <em>very</em> promising, eventually, things never work out.\nSo with the arrival of Ryzen CPUs, there was a huge furor of how things\nwere going to play out. The nice thing about Ryzen is that they are\n<em>cheap</em>, like really cheap. Although Intel still might have the most\npowerful chips, AMD has the cheapest performant ones. Therefore,\nit made sense to go with the newer Ryzen CPUs.</p>\n<p>Ryzen has tiers, just like Intel does with i3, i5, and i7. Quite (un)cleverly,\nthey are named Ryzen 3, 5, and 7.

Due to my policy\r\nof not playing or not using the work laptop(s) for playing games,\r\nI decided to get a dedicated gaming PC instead. Something beefy\r\nenough to play all those nice-looking games.\r\nI had a little saved money from all the TA/demonstrating work I did\r\nover the past few months. And with a firm belief that I must do \r\n*something* with it, I decided to get a custom machine.\r\n\r\nEarlier ideas were around ordering all the parts myself and just \r\ntaking a weekend to build them together. This brought up thoughts\r\nabout the likelihood that I may\r\nnot take important compatibilities around, not to mention the\r\ncustomer service when something does eventually go wrong\r\nis a memorable experience for all the wrong reasons. I put up a\r\npost on Facebook about this, and friends (*thanks Gareth, Aaron, Tam!*)\r\nresponded about [PCSpecialist](https://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/),\r\na UK based company that built custom PCs according to spec, and \r\noffered warranty and after-service. Okay, but what about the price\r\ndifference? Turns out that it was about a hundred or two more. I thought\r\nit was a good deal, considering I was going to get it shipped in one\r\npiece with the comfort of knowing that things will work together\r\nwell, and if they don't, I have a number to call.\r\nSo off I went to configure the beast of my gaming glory.\r\n\r\n## The What\r\n\r\n### Processors\r\n\r\nEveryone knows Intel rules the processing kingdom with both hands\r\ntied behind its back. No matter what AMD does, and sometimes it\r\ndoes things that are *very* promising, eventually, things never work out.\r\nSo with the arrival of Ryzen CPUs, there was a huge furor of how things\r\nwere going to play out. The nice thing about Ryzen is that they are\r\n*cheap*, like really cheap. Although Intel still might have the most\r\npowerful chips, AMD has the cheapest performant ones. Therefore,\r\nit made sense to go with the newer Ryzen CPUs.\r\n\r\nRyzen has tiers, just like Intel does with i3, i5, and i7. Quite (un)cleverly,\r\nthey are named Ryzen 3, 5, and 7. Ryzen 3 is good enough for entry level\r\ncomputing, but will not result in performant gaming. Therefore, Ryzen 5\r\nand Ryzen 7 are best suited for gaming. The price difference between the \r\ntop-tier Ryzen 5 and bottom-tier Ryzen 7 is nearly 100$. For economical\r\nreasons, going for a top-tier Ryzen 5 is better due to the comparative\r\nperformance specs.

Sure, there are elements of a 'gameplay', but for the most part, you will be working out the story and not worrying about the game. This post is heavy with spoilers, so if you need a shorter reaction - I liked it very much, thought it was AWESOME, and so you should go play it.</p>\n<p>Now that we can continue, let's delve proper and deep into the game. Oxenfree is about a bunch of school kids who sneak onto an island one night to party (read drink alcohol and do other teenager things). The primary protagonist is Alex, a blue-haired girl. She meets her half-brother Jonas and her best-friend Ren on the last ferry to Edwards Island, where the game takes place. The gameplay follows the characters speech through interactive bubbles that popup on top of Alex. Most of them have the form of a choice, where the selected bubble makes a difference in how other characters view and feel about Alex, and affects the later parts of the game.</p>\n<p>Once started, I immediately felt a distrust towards Ren, who insists on checking out some shady caves with elements of supernatural thrown in. But as the game progressed, my suspicions were instead turned towards Jonas, who had just turned up from nowhere. The fragile relationships of teenagers is well captured within the game, and for once, the story felt satisfying. Most of the game is about discovering the phenomenon on the island. As soon as things start to feel monotonous, there is enough variation and science fiction thrown around to make it very interesting. For example, the way time loops work in the story line is pretty amazing. The horror and creepy elements also work well.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the greatest strength of Oxenfree is its lack of cut-scenes to progress important information and elements of the story line. The gameplay and conversations feel free (even though they are not) and the story is quite well set. My one beef with the game was its ending - I did not like it.

Sure, there are elements of a 'gameplay', but for the most part, you will be working out the story and not worrying about the game. This post is heavy with spoilers, so if you need a shorter reaction - I liked it very much, thought it was AWESOME, and so you should go play it.\r\n\r\nNow that we can continue, let's delve proper and deep into the game. Oxenfree is about a bunch of school kids who sneak onto an island one night to party (read drink alcohol and do other teenager things). The primary protagonist is Alex, a blue-haired girl. She meets her half-brother Jonas and her best-friend Ren on the last ferry to Edwards Island, where the game takes place. The gameplay follows the characters speech through interactive bubbles that popup on top of Alex. Most of them have the form of a choice, where the selected bubble makes a difference in how other characters view and feel about Alex, and affects the later parts of the game.\r\n\r\nOnce started, I immediately felt a distrust towards Ren, who insists on checking out some shady caves with elements of supernatural thrown in. But as the game progressed, my suspicions were instead turned towards Jonas, who had just turned up from nowhere. The fragile relationships of teenagers is well captured within the game, and for once, the story felt satisfying. Most of the game is about discovering the phenomenon on the island. As soon as things start to feel monotonous, there is enough variation and science fiction thrown around to make it very interesting. For example, the way time loops work in the story line is pretty amazing. The horror and creepy elements also work well.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest strength of Oxenfree is its lack of cut-scenes to progress important information and elements of the story line. The gameplay and conversations feel free (even though they are not) and the story is quite well set. My one beef with the game was its ending - I did not like it. I got the 'goody-two-shoes' ending, which meant everyone was saved and the ghosts, or whatever beings they were, just left. I later found out that this was one of the possible endings. The other, and more likely, ones were far too realistic. Which included leaving one of the other people behind, essentially sacrificing them or sacrificing yourself.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think the game deserves the high praise it has received, and I will be recommending it to everyone.

My parents had bought a 486 which cost a ton back then, and simultaneously, the school I was studying in had an introductory course on computers. They taught us a programming language called&nbsp;<strong>LOGO</strong>, which involved a triangle on the screen, to which we issued commands like MOVE X PLACES, TURN LEFT, MOVE Y PLACES and so on. Most of my classmates were confused with the introduction of this new machine. To my credit, I took right to it like another exciting toy. I got proficient in moving the Turtle, as the triangle on the screen was called, and was often asked to demonstrate short programs to other children. I would sneak books in the library to find some sort of documentation on LOGO. Of course, I didn&rsquo;t know it was called documentation back then. But I got better and better at LOGO than my other school activities. I sucked at drawing and crafts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">At home, I used to draw imaginary scenes and places using&nbsp;<strong>MSPaint.</strong>&nbsp;And there were games to play on the computer. But like any other kid back then, my main playground was outside the confinements of four walls. One fine day, my mom, who was doing a short course diploma on the various technologies, was coding&nbsp;<strong>FoxPro</strong>&nbsp;at home. I sat by her side, looking at the screen, as she typed line by line of broken english words. To my 7 year old mind, it didn&rsquo;t make any sort of sense. But I could make out that it was some sort of pattern, or structure to how she was writing it. And so as I kept looking, I noticed a missing word in her lines, and pointed it out to her. She filled it with something that I didn&rsquo;t understand, but I knew that I had been correct in identifying an error in the code. That was my first exposure to&nbsp;<strong>programming</strong>. Ever since then, at that moment in my life, I had and have decided to&nbsp;<em>do something in computers</em>. What, I had not decided yet. My dream company was&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft</strong>, and I aimed to get a job there. However, I did not pay much attention to the fact, that I had to work towards getting better with computers. The constant exposure to the PC at home made me adept with all the tools available back then. I got proficient in&nbsp;<strong>Word</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Powerpoint</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Excel</strong>&nbsp;and even&nbsp;<strong>CorelDraw</strong>&nbsp;for a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Then, when I was in third grade, my family moved to the remote village of&nbsp;<strong>Kamshet</strong>, which is near the scenic hill station&nbsp;<strong>Lonavala</strong>. I hated the place. Coming from a metropolitan capital like&nbsp;<strong>Mumbai</strong>, I could not fathom the many differences I was now forced to go through. And the schools and society were very different too. For a while, my friendship with computers stagnated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">When I moved to&nbsp;<strong>Don Bosco&rsquo;s High School</strong>&nbsp;for my 5th grade, I was again introduced to computers and programming. The starting years were about going through the internals of what made a computer, something I had grasped long back. Then came the paint, and typing tests. I had the fastest typing speed of any kid in my school &ndash; about 50 words per minute. But that never sated my curiosity. Then, in the 6th grade, I got introduced to&nbsp;<strong>BASIC</strong>, a programming language known for its simplicity. While the other kids dealt with computers as another mundane subject, I got immersed into it entirely. I would write BASIC programs on paper, and search for ways to make the program perform more functions. As the other kids typed their programs line by line, looking at printed notes, I sped through ten lines at a time, writing programs from memory, trying to do something more. My teachers were always impressed with me, and always encouraged me to do more. I used to read up books, from the library, on different subjects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Back at home, the PC was upgraded to a&nbsp;<strong>Pentium</strong>, and then to a&nbsp;<strong>Pentium III</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Windows 95</strong>&nbsp;gave way to&nbsp;<strong>Windows 98</strong>. It was the golden era of computer awareness. Internet trickled into India, and my school. Of course, it was still a&nbsp;<strong>dial-up</strong>, and I did not find many resources online then. The world&rsquo;s knowledge was in the libraries, or so I thought. A computer institute had opened up next to my home in Kamshet. I used to spend my time there, looking at how they repaired PC&rsquo;s, did some typing work, or played games. I cajoled my mother into letting me join a computer class there. When we went to enquire, he gave me a plethora of options that people usually chose. Basics, Microsoft Office, DTP, etc. All of which I already knew, or had no interest in. I wanted something more exciting. He told me they were starting a small batch for people who wanted to learn&nbsp;<strong>C, a programming language</strong>. That immediately caught my fancy. And so I enrolled to learn C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The first day, I went, the person who was teaching C had already arrived and was discussing and teaching the others the basics of the language. I simply sat near him listening. He took me for a kid who was there for another class, and did not pay attention to me. The next day, the same thing happened. About halfway through, I asked him a doubt. To which, he was surprised that I was in the C class as well. He thought me too young to join. But still he continued teaching me C. As months went by, I could write basic programs in C, but nothing more. I hadn&rsquo;t yet grasped the compacted aspects that make the language such a precious tool. The teacher left the institute after that. I switched to a different institute where I started to learn&nbsp;<strong>Visual Basic 6</strong>. The teacher this time was a young software professional, who travelled everyday to come and teach me. He chided me for not being able to write a good C program, and proceeded to teach me how to do it. After that, the visual basic constructs took over, and I was thrilled at the simplicity to make&nbsp;<strong>GUI</strong>&rsquo;s. When he taught me how to connect&nbsp;<strong>MS Access</strong>&nbsp;to Visual Basic, I created a project application. One of my uncles needed to keep track of all his bills, and I created a short program that saved the bills, and allowed him to print the invoice. That was during the summer holidays between my 6th and 7th grade. Sadly, my mother had noticed that I neglected my other subjects and had ended my love affair with programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Thereafter, I did not pursue it again for years to come. But I kept tinkering with the PC at home. I played with the hardware, often bursting and short-circuiting the power supply on the board, to be severely reprimanded by my parents. Every month, I bought a magazine, either&nbsp;<strong>CHIP</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>DIGIT</strong>. Both had CD&rsquo;s that came with software. In the pre-internet age, these were my only source of software, and to know what was happening in the world out there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">After months of reading about&nbsp;<strong>Linux,</strong>&nbsp;I decided to try it once and for all. I partitioned the hard disk and tried installing it. The result was that I fried the&nbsp;<strong>boot loader</strong>. This happened a hundred more times. My parents were fed up with my constant tinkering and kept threatening me to make me stop. I would, for a while. But I was too restless to not try it again. During my 8th and 9th grades, I was fascinated with&nbsp;<strong>viruses</strong>&nbsp;and hacking. I read up everything I could find about it. A guy called Ankit Fadia had made the national news. He was young, a&nbsp;<strong>professional hacker</strong>, and had several successful books on the subject. I looked up viruses on the internet. I found dark forums where&nbsp;<strong>script-kiddies</strong>&nbsp;could find ready-made tools to deploy a malware attack. I was intrigued about how the virus managed to do all its work. And so I found the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Registry</strong>. I found out by analyzing the<strong>&nbsp;anti-virus</strong>&nbsp;databases, which viruses modified which registry keys. And I successfully modified those keys with a&nbsp;<strong>script</strong>&nbsp;without triggering the anti-virus. I had a cd full of live virus samples with their code, which was my most prized possession in those days. But for some reason, I never used those against other people. I always tested them on my own machine, on my own time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Of course, when I received the thrashing for corrupting the data on the hard drive, I could hardly stop blaming myself for being so stupid. There could have been ways to prevent that from happening. And so after that, I kind of stopped doing the whole nasty business. Everything else lay dormant until I took admission to an&nbsp;<strong>engineering</strong>&nbsp;college to study computers. I thought, ignorant as I was, that merely studying for the degree would be enough. I could never have been wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">I studied hard in the first year, concentrating most on the&nbsp;<strong>programming&nbsp;</strong>subject. It made me learn C all over again, and I got exceptionally well at that. In the second year, I was one of the few persons in the class, that could program with ease. Right since then, I spent more time doing the practicals than actually bothering with the theories. When I realized that I could have done all this by myself in school as well, I was depressed and saddened for months. I realized that by depending on the education, and only the knowledge taught by my teachers, I won&rsquo;t reach any of my aims. And so I started learning by myself, getting exposed to ideas, and trying out new stuff. I became obsessed with knowing what was happening in the tech world. Keeping myself abreast with all the latest technologies. If the course made me use Visual Basic 6, I used the latest version of&nbsp;<strong>.NET</strong>&nbsp;framework to try out things. I was never satisfied with what I was learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">But I was also&nbsp;<strong>directionless</strong>, not realizing what I needed to learn, and what things I needed to focus on. But still I struggled on. In the final year, I chose the project topic as a&nbsp;<strong>Semantic File System</strong>. I thought the future was evident in the adoption of a semantic file system. It seemed logical and blatantly obvious that the future would leap towards such semantic systems. I knew the data lay dormant in our file systems, and I wanted to tap that data, make it bend to our wills, towards how we want to use it. We ended up using the&nbsp;<strong>Apriori</strong>&nbsp;algorithm to suggest tags in the file system. It was a novel approach, but I never felt I personally had done enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">After my graduation, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my time. When I decided to do a&nbsp;<strong>masters</strong>, I had no idea what field I would choose. Somehow, I ended up doing a&nbsp;<strong>masters through research</strong>. Originally, my ideas was to access the data in the&nbsp;<strong>smartphone</strong>&nbsp;in a way similar to my final year project. But my supervisor, bless his soul, asked me to be&nbsp;<em>more specific.</em>&nbsp;And so I came up with, just on the spur of the moment, to do a contextual data research on smartphones. I find that to be one the best decisions I have ever taken in my life. It is evident again, as it was before to me, that smartphones and all connected interfaces are technological devices of the future. The PC is of the bygone era. Everything is moving to the cloud, and the access to our hands. I wanted to be ready this time, to do something that I knew WOULD be used tomorrow. That&rsquo;s my ultimate aim in life, to dream the tomorrow, and hope that it turns out to be true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If someone asks me what I really, practically want to do with my life, I would say I really wouldn&rsquo;t know. My&nbsp;<strong>dream job</strong>&nbsp;would be at Google, Apple, and their likes, even a small startup, but doing something I have great&nbsp;<strong>passion</strong>&nbsp;in &ndash; being&nbsp;<strong>technocratic</strong>&nbsp;and creating the future. If along the way, I have to struggle, I have grown to be ready for that. If along the way, I have to sacrifice, yes, I&rsquo;m ready for that. But if I have to give up, even for a while, what I want to do, what I believe in, then I&rsquo;m not yet ready to do that. Perhaps I never will be. Ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">I have plans to eventually settle down someday, maybe get married, have kids, go through my biological age. But I will never be as passionate about anything as I am about&nbsp;<strong>CREATING</strong>&nbsp;something. The morning when I wrote this, when I was in the bathroom, brushing my teeth, I wondered, who designs these toothbrushes? How do they decide that one size is the best one for all? Is there any way I would know which toothbrush is actually the best for me? Can I construct something on my own? That&rsquo;s the kind of guy I always want to be. I remember, and stay true to some greatest words of wisdom, that embodies ages of wisdom and culture passed down through my heritage -</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;<strong>Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish</strong>&rdquo;.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</div>", "body": "<div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>periodically updated</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">There isn&rsquo;t a single child in this world, who hasn&rsquo;t been asked the question &ndash; &ldquo;<em>What do you want to become when you grow up?</em>&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">And the answers are bewildering &ndash; some say bus driver, some say astronaut, some say teacher, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">When I was a kid, around the first grade, I had just been introduced to computers. My parents had bought a 486 which cost a ton back then, and simultaneously, the school I was studying in had an introductory course on computers. They taught us a programming language called&nbsp;<strong>LOGO</strong>, which involved a triangle on the screen, to which we issued commands like MOVE X PLACES, TURN LEFT, MOVE Y PLACES and so on. Most of my classmates were confused with the introduction of this new machine. To my credit, I took right to it like another exciting toy. I got proficient in moving the Turtle, as the triangle on the screen was called, and was often asked to demonstrate short programs to other children. I would sneak books in the library to find some sort of documentation on LOGO. Of course, I didn&rsquo;t know it was called documentation back then. But I got better and better at LOGO than my other school activities. I sucked at drawing and crafts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">At home, I used to draw imaginary scenes and places using&nbsp;<strong>MSPaint.</strong>&nbsp;And there were games to play on the computer. But like any other kid back then, my main playground was outside the confinements of four walls. One fine day, my mom, who was doing a short course diploma on the various technologies, was coding&nbsp;<strong>FoxPro</strong>&nbsp;at home. I sat by her side, looking at the screen, as she typed line by line of broken english words. To my 7 year old mind, it didn&rsquo;t make any sort of sense. But I could make out that it was some sort of pattern, or structure to how she was writing it. And so as I kept looking, I noticed a missing word in her lines, and pointed it out to her. She filled it with something that I didn&rsquo;t understand, but I knew that I had been correct in identifying an error in the code. That was my first exposure to&nbsp;<strong>programming</strong>. Ever since then, at that moment in my life, I had and have decided to&nbsp;<em>do something in computers</em>. What, I had not decided yet. My dream company was&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft</strong>, and I aimed to get a job there. However, I did not pay much attention to the fact, that I had to work towards getting better with computers. The constant exposure to the PC at home made me adept with all the tools available back then. I got proficient in&nbsp;<strong>Word</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Powerpoint</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Excel</strong>&nbsp;and even&nbsp;<strong>CorelDraw</strong>&nbsp;for a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Then, when I was in third grade, my family moved to the remote village of&nbsp;<strong>Kamshet</strong>, which is near the scenic hill station&nbsp;<strong>Lonavala</strong>. I hated the place. Coming from a metropolitan capital like&nbsp;<strong>Mumbai</strong>, I could not fathom the many differences I was now forced to go through. And the schools and society were very different too. For a while, my friendship with computers stagnated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">When I moved to&nbsp;<strong>Don Bosco&rsquo;s High School</strong>&nbsp;for my 5th grade, I was again introduced to computers and programming. The starting years were about going through the internals of what made a computer, something I had grasped long back. Then came the paint, and typing tests. I had the fastest typing speed of any kid in my school &ndash; about 50 words per minute. But that never sated my curiosity. Then, in the 6th grade, I got introduced to&nbsp;<strong>BASIC</strong>, a programming language known for its simplicity. While the other kids dealt with computers as another mundane subject, I got immersed into it entirely. I would write BASIC programs on paper, and search for ways to make the program perform more functions. As the other kids typed their programs line by line, looking at printed notes, I sped through ten lines at a time, writing programs from memory, trying to do something more. My teachers were always impressed with me, and always encouraged me to do more. I used to read up books, from the library, on different subjects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Back at home, the PC was upgraded to a&nbsp;<strong>Pentium</strong>, and then to a&nbsp;<strong>Pentium III</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Windows 95</strong>&nbsp;gave way to&nbsp;<strong>Windows 98</strong>. It was the golden era of computer awareness. Internet trickled into India, and my school. Of course, it was still a&nbsp;<strong>dial-up</strong>, and I did not find many resources online then. The world&rsquo;s knowledge was in the libraries, or so I thought. A computer institute had opened up next to my home in Kamshet. I used to spend my time there, looking at how they repaired PC&rsquo;s, did some typing work, or played games. I cajoled my mother into letting me join a computer class there. When we went to enquire, he gave me a plethora of options that people usually chose. Basics, Microsoft Office, DTP, etc. All of which I already knew, or had no interest in. I wanted something more exciting. He told me they were starting a small batch for people who wanted to learn&nbsp;<strong>C, a programming language</strong>. That immediately caught my fancy. And so I enrolled to learn C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The first day, I went, the person who was teaching C had already arrived and was discussing and teaching the others the basics of the language. I simply sat near him listening. He took me for a kid who was there for another class, and did not pay attention to me. The next day, the same thing happened. About halfway through, I asked him a doubt. To which, he was surprised that I was in the C class as well. He thought me too young to join. But still he continued teaching me C. As months went by, I could write basic programs in C, but nothing more. I hadn&rsquo;t yet grasped the compacted aspects that make the language such a precious tool. The teacher left the institute after that. I switched to a different institute where I started to learn&nbsp;<strong>Visual Basic 6</strong>. The teacher this time was a young software professional, who travelled everyday to come and teach me. He chided me for not being able to write a good C program, and proceeded to teach me how to do it. After that, the visual basic constructs took over, and I was thrilled at the simplicity to make&nbsp;<strong>GUI</strong>&rsquo;s. When he taught me how to connect&nbsp;<strong>MS Access</strong>&nbsp;to Visual Basic, I created a project application. One of my uncles needed to keep track of all his bills, and I created a short program that saved the bills, and allowed him to print the invoice. That was during the summer holidays between my 6th and 7th grade. Sadly, my mother had noticed that I neglected my other subjects and had ended my love affair with programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Thereafter, I did not pursue it again for years to come. But I kept tinkering with the PC at home. I played with the hardware, often bursting and short-circuiting the power supply on the board, to be severely reprimanded by my parents. Every month, I bought a magazine, either&nbsp;<strong>CHIP</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>DIGIT</strong>. Both had CD&rsquo;s that came with software. In the pre-internet age, these were my only source of software, and to know what was happening in the world out there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">After months of reading about&nbsp;<strong>Linux,</strong>&nbsp;I decided to try it once and for all. I partitioned the hard disk and tried installing it. The result was that I fried the&nbsp;<strong>boot loader</strong>. This happened a hundred more times. My parents were fed up with my constant tinkering and kept threatening me to make me stop. I would, for a while. But I was too restless to not try it again. During my 8th and 9th grades, I was fascinated with&nbsp;<strong>viruses</strong>&nbsp;and hacking. I read up everything I could find about it. A guy called Ankit Fadia had made the national news. He was young, a&nbsp;<strong>professional hacker</strong>, and had several successful books on the subject. I looked up viruses on the internet. I found dark forums where&nbsp;<strong>script-kiddies</strong>&nbsp;could find ready-made tools to deploy a malware attack. I was intrigued about how the virus managed to do all its work. And so I found the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Registry</strong>. I found out by analyzing the<strong>&nbsp;anti-virus</strong>&nbsp;databases, which viruses modified which registry keys. And I successfully modified those keys with a&nbsp;<strong>script</strong>&nbsp;without triggering the anti-virus. I had a cd full of live virus samples with their code, which was my most prized possession in those days. But for some reason, I never used those against other people. I always tested them on my own machine, on my own time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Of course, when I received the thrashing for corrupting the data on the hard drive, I could hardly stop blaming myself for being so stupid. There could have been ways to prevent that from happening. And so after that, I kind of stopped doing the whole nasty business. Everything else lay dormant until I took admission to an&nbsp;<strong>engineering</strong>&nbsp;college to study computers. I thought, ignorant as I was, that merely studying for the degree would be enough. I could never have been wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">I studied hard in the first year, concentrating most on the&nbsp;<strong>programming&nbsp;</strong>subject. It made me learn C all over again, and I got exceptionally well at that. In the second year, I was one of the few persons in the class, that could program with ease. Right since then, I spent more time doing the practicals than actually bothering with the theories. When I realized that I could have done all this by myself in school as well, I was depressed and saddened for months. I realized that by depending on the education, and only the knowledge taught by my teachers, I won&rsquo;t reach any of my aims. And so I started learning by myself, getting exposed to ideas, and trying out new stuff. I became obsessed with knowing what was happening in the tech world. Keeping myself abreast with all the latest technologies. If the course made me use Visual Basic 6, I used the latest version of&nbsp;<strong>.NET</strong>&nbsp;framework to try out things. I was never satisfied with what I was learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">But I was also&nbsp;<strong>directionless</strong>, not realizing what I needed to learn, and what things I needed to focus on. But still I struggled on. In the final year, I chose the project topic as a&nbsp;<strong>Semantic File System</strong>. I thought the future was evident in the adoption of a semantic file system. It seemed logical and blatantly obvious that the future would leap towards such semantic systems. I knew the data lay dormant in our file systems, and I wanted to tap that data, make it bend to our wills, towards how we want to use it. We ended up using the&nbsp;<strong>Apriori</strong>&nbsp;algorithm to suggest tags in the file system. It was a novel approach, but I never felt I personally had done enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">After my graduation, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my time. When I decided to do a&nbsp;<strong>masters</strong>, I had no idea what field I would choose. Somehow, I ended up doing a&nbsp;<strong>masters through research</strong>. Originally, my ideas was to access the data in the&nbsp;<strong>smartphone</strong>&nbsp;in a way similar to my final year project. But my supervisor, bless his soul, asked me to be&nbsp;<em>more specific.</em>&nbsp;And so I came up with, just on the spur of the moment, to do a contextual data research on smartphones. I find that to be one the best decisions I have ever taken in my life. It is evident again, as it was before to me, that smartphones and all connected interfaces are technological devices of the future. The PC is of the bygone era. Everything is moving to the cloud, and the access to our hands. I wanted to be ready this time, to do something that I knew WOULD be used tomorrow. That&rsquo;s my ultimate aim in life, to dream the tomorrow, and hope that it turns out to be true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If someone asks me what I really, practically want to do with my life, I would say I really wouldn&rsquo;t know. My&nbsp;<strong>dream job</strong>&nbsp;would be at Google, Apple, and their likes, even a small startup, but doing something I have great&nbsp;<strong>passion</strong>&nbsp;in &ndash; being&nbsp;<strong>technocratic</strong>&nbsp;and creating the future. If along the way, I have to struggle, I have grown to be ready for that. If along the way, I have to sacrifice, yes, I&rsquo;m ready for that. But if I have to give up, even for a while, what I want to do, what I believe in, then I&rsquo;m not yet ready to do that. Perhaps I never will be. Ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">I have plans to eventually settle down someday, maybe get married, have kids, go through my biological age. But I will never be as passionate about anything as I am about&nbsp;<strong>CREATING</strong>&nbsp;something.

It&rsquo;s one of the dream places I ever wanted to be at. Perhaps, this is the only way I&rsquo;ll ever be in. So I decided to sign up for it. Unfortunately, by the time I did go online, the developer tickets were sold out. I then decided to go as a designer. It was also cheaper, only 20&euro; to pay. And so that being done, I was ready for the weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The startup weekend took place from 6th evening to 8th night. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner included. That&rsquo;s right, free food! So I booked a cheap, but clean hostel in Dublin called Four Courts and went there on 6th afternoon. After getting lost on the way, opening up Maps a dozen times, we (me and my friend Anbarasan) finally reached Barrow Street. That&rsquo;s the address for Google&rsquo;s offices in Dublin. We had a hour for us to kill, since it was 5:30pm and the doors wouldn&rsquo;t be opening until 6:30pm. So we went to EuroSpar right next door to have some coffee (and free wi-fi). A constant barrage of people kept streaming in, and I couldn&rsquo;t help but was wondering which of them might be Googlers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sitting inside, we had some coffee, and a custard cream. In the list of wifi networks found, one name stood out. It was GoogleGuest and it was a free, open access network. So I immediately joined it, and cherished the moment when I first used Google&rsquo;s wifi. The custard cream was disappointing. At 6:30pm, we went to Gordon House get ourselves checked in. Unfortunately, our names were missing from the list they had. So a Googler came in and gave us Guest passes. And so we stepped into the magical world go Google.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/startupweekend2.jpg\"><img alt=\"Google Gordon House\" src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/startupweekend2.jpg\" style=\"height:2048px; width:1362px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My first impression was nothing special. It looked like a building, and it felt like any other building. But when I reached inside, I saw a fridge full of free beer, and all my skepticism ended right then and there. There were tons of people around, and I really liked the crowd. I want ahead and collected my free tshirt. It was blue, a little less bright than I had hoped for. The devs had it green, and the non-technical people had it red.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First activity - free pizza. So I grabbed in a few bites, and talked with people. Over there, just like that, I met a guy named Mikel and it turned out he was working right upstairs at Google. Moments later, another guy named Felix came by. His name reminded me of Felix Felices, the luck potion in Harry Potter. We were discussing Tinder and Snapchat and all sorts of things, when it was time to start the event. At first, it was the usual introduction, and then Anatoly Lebedev, the Partnership Development Manager for Google for Entrepreneurs came on stage. Another Googler experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a short game, involving making up products based on two random words stringed together, we proceeded to go towards the pitches. Each person had 60 seconds to pitch the idea and would then go and write it on a chart paper. After the pitches, people would get three votes, in the form of sticky notes, which they could put on any idea they liked. The top ideas would get to form teams. There were around 130 people in the event that day. And we had 61 pitches. It was amazing listening to all those ideas just flying off everywhere. A few caught my fancy -</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>PhotoBrag &ndash; users upload photos on the network, and everyday receive 10 pictures they have to rate. The top rated pictures score points for their owners, and they move to the top of the leaderboard. A simple idea, with the potential of getting popular. The person who pitched it was 16 year old Daniel Kyne, a friend of mine from a previous Startup Weekend.</li>\r\n\t<li>ToldYa &ndash; friends make anonymous predictions about anything, and it remains hidden until the date, when it is finally revealed to the friends so they can see if it came true. This has a great potential of getting viral as its something everyone can easily do.</li>\r\n\t<li>LunchSwap : This was pitched by Mikkel, and its kind of like Tinder for lunches, where tech people can easily meet other tech people, and it would be easy to go and have interesting conversations with new people.</li>\r\n\t<li>Gamification : This was pitched by Felix, and he wanted to overlay a virtual game over real life. I liked the idea because I have a similar thing going on with one of my experiments, where I try to adapt &nbsp;a RPG to the real world.</li>\r\n\t<li>SimpliFli : Creating a virtual shopping experience for in-flight customers, and transforming it to real world products when the users reach their destination. Rockstar pitch, but I did not want to work on this idea.</li>\r\n\t<li>I voted for PhotoBrag, ToldYa and Gamification. I too pitched my idea, which was the Remind me when&hellip; from BrainBank. Quite a few people liked it, but I only had around 4 votes at the end. The top ideas were those who had 10 votes. When all the ideas that I liked ended up being up there to form teams, I was confused. In the end, I chose LunchSwap, since that seemed to have the greatest potential. I met up with Mikkeland he was happy to have me on the team. A while later, several others came in to join as well. In the end, it was a total of 8 people, with 3 designers, 2 devs, 2 business analytics and 1 marketing guy. We brainstormed at the event for a while. Till they kicked us out at 11pm. We then went to a nearby pub, where we continued, over a pint. I excused myself since I needed my braincells to work. I had Ginger Ale. We came up with several exciting ideas, and I wanted to work right then and there. But we decided to have some sleep and meet at 9 the next morning. And so we headed home.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since we were new to Dublin, we didn&rsquo;t know the way, and ended up walking quite a bit in the wrong direction. In the end, we just took a taxi back to the Hostel. On reaching there, we couldn&rsquo;t sleep, we were too excited. So we sat in the common room, working on stuff, making notes. Finally at around 3am, we slept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although we had promised to get there by 9am, I barely woke up with half my sleep missing at 8am. We finally reached the venue at 10am. The other team members had already started working. We reached there, and brainstormed on ideas and executions and business strategies. It was really interesting to be in a barrage of ideas that just kept pouring in, and pouring out. There were mockups of what the design should be like, charts of what the monetizations should be, and a constant periodic clash between the two. It was super fun!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I missed the breakfast, but I could see bread loafs, and a bunch of other breakfast food items around. On the table were two drinks &ndash; orange water and apple green tea. Both were homemade, and sugar-free. After a while, there was candy and chips everywhere. We could just grab anything we wanted from the fridge. It was super awesome. The fridge was refilled with free beer again. Google is an awesome place to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon the team got bifurcated into two factions &ndash; the business guys, and the devs/designers. By lunch time, we had brainstormed quite a few ideas and were ready to put it into action. The mentors had arrived to guide us, and give us some tips about what we should be doing. They all liked our idea, and we got tons of input from them. We had to scrap our plans and brainstormed ideas to generate new ones. It kept getting better. For lunch, we had Indian rice, chicken, and papadum. It was really really yummy. I was really surprised that I was having indian food at Google.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/startupweekend3.jpg\"><img alt=\"Google Earth View\" src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/startupweekend3.jpg\" style=\"height:680px; width:1024px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After lunch, we decided to go into Google&rsquo;s offices to get some quite working place. So Mikkel and Felix took us to the other building Google Docks and we got our guest passes from them. The lifts were an amazing complexity puzzle where a seemingly random one would appear to fulfill our request. The speeds and operational quality of the lifts were amazing. We went off to the 7th Floor, where we occupied a Panda-style meeting room. The guys showed us around the offices, and various other floors. It was really really amazing. Every part of Google is like a different eco-system. They have a micro-kitchen at every other corner. And we could grab whatever free food or drink caught our fancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a while, when we decided to scrap the complex backend, to focus on a simple feature product. Earlier on, we had decide to have users meet and search for others based on Company, Skills and Interests. But then we focused only on Companies. In hindsight, that was a bad mistake. But we marched on, had a bit of a slowdown when it came to deciding on the deployment. The domain we had wouldn&rsquo;t take our website. So we decided to have a local demonstration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We worked on till it was around 1 am, after which Felix took us to his office in Gordon House. Some of us kept our stuff there as opposed to lugging it around. Then we checked out the offices in that building. After that, we headed home. Another day had come to an end, and we still hadn&rsquo;t gotten around to finish it yet. We decide to sleep better tomorrow and meet at 10am.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day, we came in at 10am, and had breakfast. They had muffins, and they were the most amazing muffins I&rsquo;ve ever had. We grabbed tons of them on our plates and took them back to the table. Felix brought his monitor down for us to use, and that proved to be very helpful to design the presentation. We decided to do a minimal presentation, and to finish it up quick and fast. When we first started in Powerpoint, we kept playing around to get our final design idea. Afterwards, we just abandoned the slides, and started designing everything in-house. So there were instances of Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator and tons of tabs in browsers open on all laptops. We designed a minimal theme based on the blue color from our logo, #1999CE. Our final logo was a fork and a spoon, held by a Tie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final submission time for the presentations was 4pm, which later got extended to 4:30pm. We barely made the deadline, after which Mikkel went to practice the pitch, and we cleaned up the mess on the table. The format of the final presentation was that the ordering was going to be random, and all presentations had to be pre-submitted. This was done to avoid teams working on their presentations during the final event. The presentations took place in the Auditorium, up on the first floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time of the presentations, we had a total of 21 teams pitching their ideas. It was divided into two groups of 10 and 11. Our team, now called LunchTime was at number 7 in group 1. So Mikkel and William, who were pitching were sitting on the first row, whereas the rest of us sat on the back seats. The presentations started, and we were excited to see how we would fare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/startupweekend4.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/startupweekend4.jpg\" style=\"height:450px; width:600px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When our turn came, we all went down near the stage as we had to be there when the judges asked the questions. The format was four minutes of pitch time, and three minutes of questioning by the judges. Our pitch came, and it went really smoothly. When the demo was being shown, Mikkel put up a story of wanting to go to lunch with another Googler, and our demo showed him being matched with Paddy Flynn, a judge sitting there. The crowd loved it and cheered hard. During the questions, they asked business questions, and did not trouble us much. The only thing that went wrong there was that we couldn&rsquo;t finish the presentation on time, but the end was good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most presentations lacked a few critical points we had made sure to include in our pitch. However, some others stood out really well. Like ToldYa, Twainers, Simplifi and many more. At the end, they announced four prizes. Best pitch &ndash; which went to Insurify. The girl who gave the pitch, Tracy, received a HP Chromebook. The third place went to Twainers, and they received a 250$ Amazon web services credit. The second place went to ToldYa, and they got 500$ worth of Amazon web services credit. The first place went to Simplifi, who had put up an amazing pitch. It wasn&rsquo;t surprising to anyone that they won. They received 10,000$ worth of credit for Google Cloud Services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/startupweekend5.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/startupweekend5.jpg\" style=\"height:693px; width:924px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we got out, I wanted to get a souvenir from the Google Store, but it was closed. Felix, who was going to his office upstairs, got me his tshirt. It was A Google Adsense 10 year tshirt. Although still silly, I had an authentic Google tshirt that I could always cherish. He also said that I could drop by the next day or any other time, to get to the Google Store. Cool, awesome guy! I really like him!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/startupweekend6.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/startupweekend6.jpg\" style=\"height:684px; width:912px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After that, we went to the nearby pub, where we celebrated over a few drinks. They were showing our pictures over on the big screen, and every time the team&rsquo;s picture appeared, they cheered. We had a lot of conversations, some silly, some really good. But it was an interesting time. One by one, everyone left, and the pub closed at midnight as well. Anbu and me got some Fish and Chips from across the bar and headed to our Hostel. There, we couldn&rsquo;t sleep at all, and played pool in the common room. Finally, I got sleepy and left to sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/startupweekend7.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/startupweekend7.jpg\" style=\"height:693px; width:924px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that was the end of my weekend, where although I did not win anything, I got to see Google, inside out. I could talk to actual Googlers, get a tour around their offices, had tons of amazing free foods and drinks, and got a silly Google tshirt as well. But more importantly, I learned what it takes to get out there and start a startup. How a perfect pitch is delivered. What is needed to keep the team together. Why its important to manage everyone. What do the designers do, why they are important. The same for business and Finance people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But most of all, I had an immense fun and the satisfaction of actually being a part of a team, and working to create something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Team :</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Mikel</li>\r\n\t<li>Felix</li>\r\n\t<li>Craig</li>\r\n\t<li>William</li>\r\n\t<li>Luca</li>\r\n\t<li>Anbarasan</li>\r\n\t<li>Fabian</li>\r\n\t<li>Harshvardhan (me)</li>\r\n</ul>", "body": "<p>The primary reason I got so excited about Startup Weekend Dublin is that it was hosted at Google. It&rsquo;s one of the dream places I ever wanted to be at. Perhaps, this is the only way I&rsquo;ll ever be in. So I decided to sign up for it. Unfortunately, by the time I did go online, the developer tickets were sold out. I then decided to go as a designer. It was also cheaper, only 20&euro; to pay. And so that being done, I was ready for the weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The startup weekend took place from 6th evening to 8th night. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner included. That&rsquo;s right, free food! So I booked a cheap, but clean hostel in Dublin called Four Courts and went there on 6th afternoon. After getting lost on the way, opening up Maps a dozen times, we (me and my friend Anbarasan) finally reached Barrow Street. That&rsquo;s the address for Google&rsquo;s offices in Dublin. We had a hour for us to kill, since it was 5:30pm and the doors wouldn&rsquo;t be opening until 6:30pm. So we went to EuroSpar right next door to have some coffee (and free wi-fi). A constant barrage of people kept streaming in, and I couldn&rsquo;t help but was wondering which of them might be Googlers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sitting inside, we had some coffee, and a custard cream. In the list of wifi networks found, one name stood out. It was GoogleGuest and it was a free, open access network. So I immediately joined it, and cherished the moment when I first used Google&rsquo;s wifi. The custard cream was disappointing. At 6:30pm, we went to Gordon House get ourselves checked in. Unfortunately, our names were missing from the list they had. So a Googler came in and gave us Guest passes. And so we stepped into the magical world go Google.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/startupweekend2.jpg\"><img alt=\"Google Gordon House\" src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/startupweekend2.jpg\" style=\"height:2048px; width:1362px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My first impression was nothing special. It looked like a building, and it felt like any other building. But when I reached inside, I saw a fridge full of free beer, and all my skepticism ended right then and there. There were tons of people around, and I really liked the crowd. I want ahead and collected my free tshirt. It was blue, a little less bright than I had hoped for. The devs had it green, and the non-technical people had it red.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First activity - free pizza. So I grabbed in a few bites, and talked with people. Over there, just like that, I met a guy named Mikel and it turned out he was working right upstairs at Google. Moments later, another guy named Felix came by. His name reminded me of Felix Felices, the luck potion in Harry Potter. We were discussing Tinder and Snapchat and all sorts of things, when it was time to start the event. At first, it was the usual introduction, and then Anatoly Lebedev, the Partnership Development Manager for Google for Entrepreneurs came on stage. Another Googler experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a short game, involving making up products based on two random words stringed together, we proceeded to go towards the pitches. Each person had 60 seconds to pitch the idea and would then go and write it on a chart paper. After the pitches, people would get three votes, in the form of sticky notes, which they could put on any idea they liked. The top ideas would get to form teams. There were around 130 people in the event that day. And we had 61 pitches. It was amazing listening to all those ideas just flying off everywhere. A few caught my fancy -</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>PhotoBrag &ndash; users upload photos on the network, and everyday receive 10 pictures they have to rate. The top rated pictures score points for their owners, and they move to the top of the leaderboard. A simple idea, with the potential of getting popular. The person who pitched it was 16 year old Daniel Kyne, a friend of mine from a previous Startup Weekend.</li>\r\n\t<li>ToldYa &ndash; friends make anonymous predictions about anything, and it remains hidden until the date, when it is finally revealed to the friends so they can see if it came true. This has a great potential of getting viral as its something everyone can easily do.</li>\r\n\t<li>LunchSwap : This was pitched by Mikkel, and its kind of like Tinder for lunches, where tech people can easily meet other tech people, and it would be easy to go and have interesting conversations with new people.</li>\r\n\t<li>Gamification : This was pitched by Felix, and he wanted to overlay a virtual game over real life. I liked the idea because I have a similar thing going on with one of my experiments, where I try to adapt &nbsp;a RPG to the real world.</li>\r\n\t<li>SimpliFli : Creating a virtual shopping experience for in-flight customers, and transforming it to real world products when the users reach their destination. Rockstar pitch, but I did not want to work on this idea.</li>\r\n\t<li>I voted for PhotoBrag, ToldYa and Gamification. I too pitched my idea, which was the Remind me when&hellip; from BrainBank. Quite a few people liked it, but I only had around 4 votes at the end. The top ideas were those who had 10 votes. When all the ideas that I liked ended up being up there to form teams, I was confused. In the end, I chose LunchSwap, since that seemed to have the greatest potential. I met up with Mikkeland he was happy to have me on the team. A while later, several others came in to join as well. In the end, it was a total of 8 people, with 3 designers, 2 devs, 2 business analytics and 1 marketing guy. We brainstormed at the event for a while. Till they kicked us out at 11pm. We then went to a nearby pub, where we continued, over a pint. I excused myself since I needed my braincells to work. I had Ginger Ale. We came up with several exciting ideas, and I wanted to work right then and there. But we decided to have some sleep and meet at 9 the next morning. And so we headed home.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since we were new to Dublin, we didn&rsquo;t know the way, and ended up walking quite a bit in the wrong direction. In the end, we just took a taxi back to the Hostel. On reaching there, we couldn&rsquo;t sleep, we were too excited. So we sat in the common room, working on stuff, making notes. Finally at around 3am, we slept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although we had promised to get there by 9am, I barely woke up with half my sleep missing at 8am. We finally reached the venue at 10am. The other team members had already started working. We reached there, and brainstormed on ideas and executions and business strategies. It was really interesting to be in a barrage of ideas that just kept pouring in, and pouring out. There were mockups of what the design should be like, charts of what the monetizations should be, and a constant periodic clash between the two. It was super fun!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I missed the breakfast, but I could see bread loafs, and a bunch of other breakfast food items around. On the table were two drinks &ndash; orange water and apple green tea. Both were homemade, and sugar-free. After a while, there was candy and chips everywhere. We could just grab anything we wanted from the fridge. It was super awesome. The fridge was refilled with free beer again. Google is an awesome place to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon the team got bifurcated into two factions &ndash; the business guys, and the devs/designers. By lunch time, we had brainstormed quite a few ideas and were ready to put it into action. The mentors had arrived to guide us, and give us some tips about what we should be doing. They all liked our idea, and we got tons of input from them. We had to scrap our plans and brainstormed ideas to generate new ones. It kept getting better. For lunch, we had Indian rice, chicken, and papadum. It was really really yummy. I was really surprised that I was having indian food at Google.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/startupweekend3.jpg\"><img alt=\"Google Earth View\" src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/startupweekend3.jpg\" style=\"height:680px; width:1024px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After lunch, we decided to go into Google&rsquo;s offices to get some quite working place. So Mikkel and Felix took us to the other building Google Docks and we got our guest passes from them. The lifts were an amazing complexity puzzle where a seemingly random one would appear to fulfill our request. The speeds and operational quality of the lifts were amazing. We went off to the 7th Floor, where we occupied a Panda-style meeting room. The guys showed us around the offices, and various other floors. It was really really amazing. Every part of Google is like a different eco-system. They have a micro-kitchen at every other corner. And we could grab whatever free food or drink caught our fancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a while, when we decided to scrap the complex backend, to focus on a simple feature product. Earlier on, we had decide to have users meet and search for others based on Company, Skills and Interests. But then we focused only on Companies. In hindsight, that was a bad mistake. But we marched on, had a bit of a slowdown when it came to deciding on the deployment. The domain we had wouldn&rsquo;t take our website. So we decided to have a local demonstration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We worked on till it was around 1 am, after which Felix took us to his office in Gordon House. Some of us kept our stuff there as opposed to lugging it around. Then we checked out the offices in that building. After that, we headed home. Another day had come to an end, and we still hadn&rsquo;t gotten around to finish it yet. We decide to sleep better tomorrow and meet at 10am.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day, we came in at 10am, and had breakfast. They had muffins, and they were the most amazing muffins I&rsquo;ve ever had. We grabbed tons of them on our plates and took them back to the table. Felix brought his monitor down for us to use, and that proved to be very helpful to design the presentation. We decided to do a minimal presentation, and to finish it up quick and fast. When we first started in Powerpoint, we kept playing around to get our final design idea. Afterwards, we just abandoned the slides, and started designing everything in-house. So there were instances of Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator and tons of tabs in browsers open on all laptops. We designed a minimal theme based on the blue color from our logo, #1999CE. Our final logo was a fork and a spoon, held by a Tie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final submission time for the presentations was 4pm, which later got extended to 4:30pm. We barely made the deadline, after which Mikkel went to practice the pitch, and we cleaned up the mess on the table. The format of the final presentation was that the ordering was going to be random, and all presentations had to be pre-submitted. This was done to avoid teams working on their presentations during the final event. The presentations took place in the Auditorium, up on the first floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time of the presentations, we had a total of 21 teams pitching their ideas. It was divided into two groups of 10 and 11. Our team, now called LunchTime was at number 7 in group 1. So Mikkel and William, who were pitching were sitting on the first row, whereas the rest of us sat on the back seats. The presentations started, and we were excited to see how we would fare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/startupweekend4.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/startupweekend4.jpg\" style=\"height:450px; width:600px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When our turn came, we all went down near the stage as we had to be there when the judges asked the questions. The format was four minutes of pitch time, and three minutes of questioning by the judges. Our pitch came, and it went really smoothly. When the demo was being shown, Mikkel put up a story of wanting to go to lunch with another Googler, and our demo showed him being matched with Paddy Flynn, a judge sitting there. The crowd loved it and cheered hard. During the questions, they asked business questions, and did not trouble us much. The only thing that went wrong there was that we couldn&rsquo;t finish the presentation on time, but the end was good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most presentations lacked a few critical points we had made sure to include in our pitch. However, some others stood out really well. Like ToldYa, Twainers, Simplifi and many more. At the end, they announced four prizes. Best pitch &ndash; which went to Insurify. The girl who gave the pitch, Tracy, received a HP Chromebook. The third place went to Twainers, and they received a 250$ Amazon web services credit. The second place went to ToldYa, and they got 500$ worth of Amazon web services credit. The first place went to Simplifi, who had put up an amazing pitch. It wasn&rsquo;t surprising to anyone that they won. They received 10,000$ worth of credit for Google Cloud Services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/startupweekend5.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/startupweekend5.jpg\" style=\"height:693px; width:924px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we got out, I wanted to get a souvenir from the Google Store, but it was closed. Felix, who was going to his office upstairs, got me his tshirt. It was A Google Adsense 10 year tshirt. Although still silly, I had an authentic Google tshirt that I could always cherish.

Right from India&rsquo;s Independence in 1947, its languages have been under a constant plight to be understood by the entirety of its masses. India is perhaps, the most diverse country in terms of culture, and languages spoken therein. It&rsquo;s first Prime Minister &ndash; Nehru, tried to rally Hindi as the national language, as he felt it could be picked up by most Indians, as all indian languages are allied to each other [1]. What is to be understood before delving deeper into this decision is that, for many a years, the British Empire ruling in India has set up a system of governance and offices that operated in English. Therefore, at the time of Independence, all of India&rsquo;s offices and governance bodies operated in English by default.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0)\">Nehru supported a provision in the&nbsp;<strong>Constitution</strong>&nbsp;that Hindi should be the&nbsp;<strong>official language</strong>, but English be used as the official language for the future 15 years,&nbsp; till 1965. He had hoped, like many others, that during this period, Hindi would have gained general acceptance and the required strength to become the uniting language in India.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0)\">In 1959,&nbsp;<strong>Nehru</strong>&nbsp;promised that that there would be no imposition of any language, and that English would remain an additional language for an indefinite period [1]. This was the result of the general failure of Hindi being adopted by the masses. Most of the government posts and offices now operated in Hindi, and the armed forces primarily used it as well. However, the population had failed to catch on Hindi in a way that justified it being made the national language. A provision was made to continue using English, along side Hindi indefinitely for official purposes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0)\">By contrasting the dream of making Hindi a&nbsp;<strong>national language</strong>, to replacing English, the latter expanded to more people as a second or third language instead. The education system, and internationalization of communication, spread the use of English much more than any other language. In India&rsquo;s multi-language states, English is often called as the &lsquo;link-language&rsquo; as it is the preferred means of communication on a common ground for people between states.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0)\">Part II : Constitution</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0)\">The current scenario lists a&nbsp;<strong>pseudo-bilingual system</strong>&nbsp;comprising of English and the regional language being the preferred choice of governing bodies, with the center primarily opting to use English along with Hindi [2]. However, all authoritative texts for all laws, and dictums made under the Parliament should be in English unless decided otherwise [3].</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0)\">For&nbsp;<strong>Administration</strong>, the Union government is required by law to progressively increase the use of Hindi in its official work, [4]which it has sought to do through &ldquo;persuasion, incentive and goodwill.&rdquo; Therefore, progressively increasing the use of Hindi is a mandate the government follows in terms with the constitution. However, the words persuasion, incentive and goodwill are important as well, as they dictate the terms of a democracy and not autocracy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0)\">Further more, the&nbsp;<strong>Official Language Act</strong>&nbsp;says that the Union Government use Hindi and English in &lsquo;most&rsquo; administrative documents intended for the public. It also provides a higher degree of usage for Hindi in communications between offices, except Tamil Nadu where the language Tamil substitutes Hindi. Communications within offices of the same department must be in Hindi for Hindi-speaking states [5] and either in Hindi or English. It is the duty of the Government to provide a translation to other languages if required under the circumstances. Every person submitting a petition or a grievance has the constitutional right to submit it in any language used in India. [6]</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0)\">The government has taken various steps over time to implement the use and&nbsp;<strong>increase familiarisation of Hindi</strong>&nbsp;extensively. Regional Hindi implementation offices at various places, most notably in Southern states, have been established to monitor the implementation of Hindi in Central government offices and PSUs. Annual targets are set by the Department of Official Language regarding the amount of correspondence being carried out in Hindi. A Parliament Committee on Official Language constituted in 1976 periodically reviews the progress in the use of Hindi and submits a report to the President. The governmental body which makes policy decisions and established guidelines for promotion of Hindi is the&nbsp;<em>Kendriya Hindi Samiti</em>&nbsp;(est. 1967). In every city that has more than ten central Government offices, a Town Official Language Implementation Committee is established and cash awards are given to government employees who write books in Hindi. All Central government offices and PSUs are to establish Hindi Cells for implementation of Hindi in their offices.

Right from India&rsquo;s Independence in 1947, its languages have been under a constant plight to be understood by the entirety of its masses. India is perhaps, the most diverse country in terms of culture, and languages spoken therein. It&rsquo;s first Prime Minister &ndash; Nehru, tried to rally Hindi as the national language, as he felt it could be picked up by most Indians, as all indian languages are allied to each other [1]. What is to be understood before delving deeper into this decision is that, for many a years, the British Empire ruling in India has set up a system of governance and offices that operated in English. Therefore, at the time of Independence, all of India&rsquo;s offices and governance bodies operated in English by default.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0)\">Nehru supported a provision in the&nbsp;<strong>Constitution</strong>&nbsp;that Hindi should be the&nbsp;<strong>official language</strong>, but English be used as the official language for the future 15 years,&nbsp; till 1965. He had hoped, like many others, that during this period, Hindi would have gained general acceptance and the required strength to become the uniting language in India.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0)\">In 1959,&nbsp;<strong>Nehru</strong>&nbsp;promised that that there would be no imposition of any language, and that English would remain an additional language for an indefinite period [1]. This was the result of the general failure of Hindi being adopted by the masses. Most of the government posts and offices now operated in Hindi, and the armed forces primarily used it as well. However, the population had failed to catch on Hindi in a way that justified it being made the national language. A provision was made to continue using English, along side Hindi indefinitely for official purposes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0)\">By contrasting the dream of making Hindi a&nbsp;<strong>national language</strong>, to replacing English, the latter expanded to more people as a second or third language instead. The education system, and internationalization of communication, spread the use of English much more than any other language. In India&rsquo;s multi-language states, English is often called as the &lsquo;link-language&rsquo; as it is the preferred means of communication on a common ground for people between states.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0)\">Part II : Constitution</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0)\">The current scenario lists a&nbsp;<strong>pseudo-bilingual system</strong>&nbsp;comprising of English and the regional language being the preferred choice of governing bodies, with the center primarily opting to use English along with Hindi [2].

However, the words persuasion, incentive and goodwill are important as well, as they dictate the terms of a democracy and not autocracy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0)\">Further more, the&nbsp;<strong>Official Language Act</strong>&nbsp;says that the Union Government use Hindi and English in &lsquo;most&rsquo; administrative documents intended for the public. It also provides a higher degree of usage for Hindi in communications between offices, except Tamil Nadu where the language Tamil substitutes Hindi. Communications within offices of the same department must be in Hindi for Hindi-speaking states [5] and either in Hindi or English. It is the duty of the Government to provide a translation to other languages if required under the circumstances. Every person submitting a petition or a grievance has the constitutional right to submit it in any language used in India.

Regional Hindi implementation offices at various places, most notably in Southern states, have been established to monitor the implementation of Hindi in Central government offices and PSUs. Annual targets are set by the Department of Official Language regarding the amount of correspondence being carried out in Hindi. A Parliament Committee on Official Language constituted in 1976 periodically reviews the progress in the use of Hindi and submits a report to the President. The governmental body which makes policy decisions and established guidelines for promotion of Hindi is the&nbsp;<em>Kendriya Hindi Samiti</em>&nbsp;(est. 1967). In every city that has more than ten central Government offices, a Town Official Language Implementation Committee is established and cash awards are given to government employees who write books in Hindi. All Central government offices and PSUs are to establish Hindi Cells for implementation of Hindi in their offices.

But when one is designing a library or a framework which every app is supposed to query, it becomes critical that the results are shared back in the smallest amount of time. This is where knowing the basics helped me a lot. I know that certain operations are faster than others, even though the results returned are the same. I&rsquo;ve tried to save the references and reuse them, just so the system wouldn&rsquo;t have to garbage collect them, wasting my time. The loops have been optimized for least iterations possible. Sure, the compiler might do that anyways, but I can&rsquo;t rely on that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All these nifty little tricks are from the days, when C was the primary language of coding. We learned to handle pointers with caution. But a world of programmers screamed in glee when Java didn&rsquo;t sport them. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the world is free of troubles. We now have references, which although much simpler and easier to use than pointers, are also much more sly. I have to be careful to know whether the reference I&rsquo;m holding is the same one held by the other side. If not, then I&rsquo;m going to run into errors at RunTime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of the things are what is called &ldquo;programming common-sense&rdquo;. One doesn&rsquo;t have to specifically learn C, or Operating Systems in college to know them. But like I said right at the start, they&rsquo;re the basics. And knowing them is going to be very, very helpful to do things.</p>", "headerimage": "", "highlight": "0", "series": 5}, {"id": 5, "title": "Handicapped", "authors": "1", "date_created": "2014-07-15 15:00:00", "date_published": "2014-07-15 15:00:00", "date_updated": "2017-05-03 20:09:34", "is_published": "1", "short_description": "Handicapped", "tags": "10", "slug": "handicapped", "body_type": "html", "body_text": "<div>\r\n<p>A few days back, almost a week perhaps, I noticed slight fatigue in my body.

I answered them the best I can, not thinking much, answering whatever came to my mind the first time around. It was a great exercise in knowing what I think about many things. It made me feel like an interview, and I was really tempted to write this as one. But in the end, I decided it to keep it in the Q&amp;A format. I highly recommend all of you to at least try and think about your answers to these questions. The link to the questions is at the bottom. Enjoy!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>1. Do you like who you are?</strong><br />\r\nYes, I do. I&nbsp;<em>love</em>&nbsp;who I am. There have been times when I&rsquo;ve doubted myself, but then I&rsquo;ve always come around. For me, there are only two ways one can go from here. Either you like who you are, with full conscious measure. Or else, you start working on the parts you&nbsp;<em>don&rsquo;t</em>&nbsp;like and turn them into those you&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;like. I&rsquo;m always at the latter stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. What would people say about you at your funeral?</strong><br />\r\nIf I had it my way, they&rsquo;d each recite their favorite verse from my poems or a quote from my stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. What would you regret not doing in your life?</strong><br />\r\nA great many things, though I&rsquo;m sure many more are yet to come. My most strongest regret is that I didn&rsquo;t study computer science from a very young age when I had both the genius and the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. What&rsquo;s the wisest thing you have ever heard someone say?</strong><br />\r\nI&rsquo;ve actually read it rather than hearing. It was about worrying. If you can do something about it, why worry? If you can&rsquo;t do anything about it, why worry?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. What lessons in life did you learn the hard way?</strong><br />\r\nPerhaps, all of them. Most important of them might be to cherish and keep carefully what is precious. And I don&rsquo;t mean that in the materialistic way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. How often do your biggest worries and fears come true?</strong><br />\r\nEvery few years. I fear people I&rsquo;ve opened up to, drifting away from me. But with person, I get a little more used to it happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. If you had one year left to live, what would you try to achieve?</strong><br />\r\nNothing! I&rsquo;d simply live my life traveling and idling about lost dreaming about something or the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Do you serve money or does money serve you?</strong><br />\r\nMoney serves me. Money is only the means for ends for me. I long for money to do things I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do. But having money does not define the sort of person I am, or want to become.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. Are you afraid of being your true self around others? Why?</strong><br />\r\nA part of me is always secluded inside, and its something I&rsquo;m not comfortable sharing with almost everyone. But beyond that I&rsquo;m very much an extrovert and am my true self around everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. What are you grateful for?</strong><br />\r\nIf I have to chose one thing, it would be my parents, and then my zeal to read books during growing up. Both helped me be what I am today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>11. Have you done anything you are proud of lately?</strong><br />\r\nIf you ask me this in a few more months, I&rsquo;d have completed a thesis based on something I&rsquo;m really passionate about. I&rsquo;d be really proud of myself then. Until then, I can only dream about it, and keep working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>12. Have you made any recent acts of kindness?</strong><br />\r\nI do not believe in charity. But I do believe in kindness. I&rsquo;ve taken to helping friends and considerate person whenever the need arises. I try to help them in any measure possible, and make sure I learn something along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>13. If you knew that you would die tomorrow, what questions would you ask yourself?</strong><br />\r\nI&rsquo;d ask what&rsquo;s the best way possible to create a life-journal in one day. And I&rsquo;d ask what each page would contain. Basically, it&rsquo;d be a recollection of my entire life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>14. If your biggest fears came true, would it matter in five years from now?</strong><br />\r\nYes. Anyone who said no, would be lying. My biggest fear is losing the people. Everything else I can manage or control. But if I lose my people, it would matter five, or fifty years from now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>15. How would you describe yourself?</strong><br />\r\nI&rsquo;m not sure how to answer that in a short manner. But there&rsquo;s a very carefully chosen set of words in the &lsquo;About Me&rsquo; page of my website. They&rsquo;d be the best possible answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>16. Do you take people&rsquo;s advice?</strong><br />\r\nYes, and almost repent it afterwards. Sometimes I forget I&rsquo;m not supposed to blindly follow someone&rsquo;s advice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17. Do you get quickly offended?</strong><br />\r\nYes, I have a short temper, and very little patience. But I often try to ride out the anger. Unless it&rsquo;s something serious, or blatant and malicious, I can quell my anger away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>18. Do you consider yourself to be a likable person?</strong><br />\r\nIn the most sociable way, no, I don&rsquo;t think the average person could like me. I&rsquo;m crude in a way, and only people who can understand crudeness can like me. Every other like is superficial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>19. &lsquo;We make a living by what we get, we make a life by what we give&rsquo; &ndash; What does this mean to you?</strong><br />\r\nThe get here is everything life throws at us. It&rsquo;s something beyond our control, and we have to learn to accept it, to adapt to it, and to try and live our own way. That&rsquo;s our giving, living our way. What we give is purely ours, and it&rsquo;s up to us whether we want to give something true of us, or live a false pretense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>20. Are you enriching the lives of others?</strong><br />\r\nFrankly, I don&rsquo;t live to enrich life of others. It&rsquo;s not my goal, and I cannot go out of my way to do that. There&rsquo;s a big difference between doing something for someone and enriching their lives. I&rsquo;d rather live my own life, than live for someone else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>21. Are you living a meaningful life?</strong><br />\r\nYes, and thankfully I am capable of realizing that. Life isn&rsquo;t meaningful by itself. It&rsquo;s only when we realize and act on it can we make our life meaningful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>22. What makes a meaningful life?</strong><br />\r\nTo live a meaningful life, one must first know the meaning of life. It&rsquo;s purpose. One finds it as one grows and matures. To live by and for the purpose it to live a meaningful life. For me, my purpose is to remain true to myself. I cannot curtail my dreams, or passions because that would be lying as to what I want to do. Living a meaningful life for me is to follow my dreams and passions while trying to become the man I see myself to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>23. Would you ever give up your life to save another?</strong><br />\r\nYes, if it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>24. How much would you be willing to sacrifice for people in poverty?</strong><br />\r\nI won&rsquo;t sacrifice anything for poverty. I don&rsquo;t believe in charity. But I do believe in kindness. And I would help along for improving social conditions if I can. But it has to be towards meaningful results and not be stuck in a loop of doing it again and again expecting it to change by itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>25. If you could live one day over and over again, what would you choose to do?</strong><br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s a few days actually. The day I looked into her and found myself. I know it&rsquo;s cryptic, but really personal, and I don&rsquo;t really want to disturb lives of other people. A few other days are hand-picked ones with friends and family. The usual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>26. Do you think you are important and worthy of affection and love?</strong><br />\r\nWhose affection and whose love? If I can answer that question satisfactorily, then yes, definitely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>27. What would make you feel more worthy? What do you believe needs to be different about you?</strong><br />\r\nFor one, achieving a lot more than what I already have. That would really give me a self-boost. And that&rsquo;s precisely what I need to really change about myself. I need to do more to achieve something. I need to take small steps instead of waiting for a long jump. I&rsquo;m working on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>28. What brings you down the most often?</strong><br />\r\nMy work. There&rsquo;s nothing else that can wreck me like my work can. Every few days I break down and freeze thinking that I am doing the shittiest work I ever have done. It&rsquo;s ok, it&rsquo;s natural, it helps me evaluate my work and do course correction. Earlier it used to be people&rsquo;s behaviors, but with time I&rsquo;ve learnt to deal with that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>29. Would you rather work less (and do the things you enjoy) and have less money?</strong><br />\r\nYou&rsquo;re asking me as if I have a choice. I&rsquo;m already living that life. If I cannot enjoy something, I won&rsquo;t do it for money. That&rsquo;s the main reason I&rsquo;m doing research, because I&rsquo;m really passionate about it. And currently, it&rsquo;s paying me nothing back except joy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>30. Where do you find peace?</strong><br />\r\nWithin myself. All other places are temporary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>31. What is the most important quality you look for in another person?</strong><br />\r\nHonesty. Integrity. Without either, there can be no trust. And without trust, there can be no relation between two people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>32. What is your biggest dream in life?</strong><br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s weird actually, but I don&rsquo;t dream that far, or that big. I&rsquo;m always dreaming about the next few steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>33. What is your biggest fear?</strong><br />\r\nI think I&rsquo;ve answered this before. I fear people drifting away. Leaving me. I also fear not being able to work, or to not achieve. It&rsquo;s not a fear of failure, but rather a fear of not giving my best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>34. How would the world be different if you had never been born?</strong><br />\r\nHow would I know!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>35. What life lessons do you wish you knew 10 years ago?</strong><br />\r\nTo let things go, and that most things that we are disturbed about, don&rsquo;t really matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>36. If you could tell your younger self one thing, what would it be?</strong><br />\r\nTo really buckle down and start working on my passions. I was a very confused kid 10 years ago. I had everything in me back then, all the capabilities and abilities. I only needed a little more focus and clarity. And a little guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>37. If your life was a movie, what would the title be?</strong><br />\r\nStop deciding, and start doing. My life would be a good demonstration of why that&rsquo;s necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>38. If your life was a movie, would you enjoy watching it?</strong><br />\r\nIf it played out with exactly the same images, and persons from my memories, then yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>39. What does success mean to you?</strong><br />\r\nSatisfaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>40. If you could be a different person, who would you be?</strong><br />\r\nMe, but without all things I don&rsquo;t want in me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>41. What was the best day of your life? Why?</strong><br />\r\nI already answered this when I was asked what day I would like to relive again and again. I&rsquo;ll just answer the why here. I&rsquo;ve always had a mirror image, perhaps of myself, as the sort of person who would come along. It&rsquo;s an innocent dream, and the best day is when you realize it has come true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>42. What do you look forward to most in life?</strong><br />\r\nAt any given moment, I&rsquo;m always looking forward to doing all the things I&rsquo;ve decided to do at the moment. There&rsquo;s no specific moment I keep looking forward to. I&rsquo;m always too caught up in whatever is going on in near time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>43. What bad habits do you want to ditch?</strong><br />\r\nI could make a list of 101 things. But to name a few, letting things go, specially negative emotions. Life is really peaceful and serene without them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>44. Who do you look up to and why?</strong><br />\r\nThere isn&rsquo;t one person who&rsquo;s everything for me. I look up to many things in many people. My parents, my friends, a great many leaders and inventors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>45. Do you know your partners love language?</strong><br />\r\nSure. We wouldn&rsquo;t be partners otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>46. Do the people you love most know how much you love them?</strong><br />\r\nI don&rsquo;t really know. I don&rsquo;t want to go out of my way to show them that. It&rsquo;s something one has to realize on it&rsquo;s own. Trying to show someone how much you love them is an insecurity and I cannot afford to have those.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>47. Are you satisfied with the depth of your relationships?</strong><br />\r\nNever. I always want more. Which is why they grow deep very quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>48. What do you owe yourself?</strong><br />\r\nHonest efforts and labour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>49. Based on your current day-to-day life, what do you expect to achieve in 5 years from now?</strong><br />\r\nIf I&rsquo;m right about myself, one of these things would have happened. I would have completed my PhD research, would have earned a job in some exciting company, and would be working away in delight. Otherwise, I&rsquo;d be working for a few more years in some exciting company anyways without a PhD. I have no idea or expectations about anything else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>50. Do you say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; too often when you really want to say &lsquo;no&rsquo;? Why?</strong><br />\r\nI say no a lot more times than saying yes. At the risk of sounding negative, saying no at the risk of alienating is better than saying yes and burdening yourself with extra duties and disappointments. I can always change the no to a yes if I feel like it, but its not as easy the other way round.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>51. What did you learn yesterday?</strong><br />\r\nI learnt how little I knew about Android memory management, or design patterns in general. I learnt the effects of a large dose of caffeine to my body. I also learnt that Georgia dies, and Shaun lives, but that&rsquo;s irrelevant to others. I also learnt that I have grown in patience and control over my emotions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>52. What do you like about yourself?</strong><br />\r\nThe one thing above all, my deep, branching, analytical thinking. It&rsquo;s both an asset and a liability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>53. Would you consider yourself to be a generous person?</strong><br />\r\nNo, I&rsquo;d rather hold out until I&rsquo;m sure about the need and the merit of giving things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>54. Do you really listen when people talk to you?</strong><br />\r\nYes, I listen, I draw mental maps, and I remember a lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>55. What is the number one change you need to make in your life this year?</strong><br />\r\nI already have the resolution, to give my best. Somehow, such resolutions are never fully kept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>56. How many hours per week do you spend on the internet?</strong><br />\r\nAlmost all of them. My devices are online when I&rsquo;m sleeping. Otherwise, on an average, anywhere from 14-18hours of each day. And still, I can safely claim that I&rsquo;m not addicted, because I&rsquo;m perfectly capable of channeling my activities to other things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>57. What are your most common negative thoughts? Are they logical?</strong><br />\r\nThey are about why, or how, someone hasn&rsquo;t bothered to reply back, or answer, or acknowledge, or even be nice. I&rsquo;m very critical of people&rsquo;s responses and behavior. The more closer to me a person is, the more critical I become. I call this anal-retentive-disorder. I realize it&rsquo;s not logical, which is why I try to discard them from my mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>58. Do you think it&rsquo;s too late to do certain things in your life? Why?</strong><br />\r\nA few of the things can never really be changed. Because one doesn&rsquo;t have the time or the age or the opportunities to do the same again. However, I am a staunch believer of taking my life forward from this point onwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>59. If you could be the most influential person in the world, what would you change?</strong><br />\r\nThe attitude of people towards social norms and customs. It&rsquo;s bizarre we hold each other back so much just out of social fear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>60. How much time do you spend with your family and friends?</strong><br />\r\nDepends on what we all are doing. I&rsquo;m very absorbed in my work. But I do like taking time out and going with friends, or talking to them, but I&rsquo;m not conscious of how much time I&rsquo;m&nbsp;<em>supposed</em>&nbsp;to spend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>61. Where do you want to be in 5 years from now?</strong><br />\r\nHopefully in a better place. As I said earlier, with a PhD and an exciting job. Anything other than that is a bonus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>62. Is your life complicated by unnecessary things?</strong><br />\r\nNo, I complicate things by choice. What appears complicated to most other people, is actually a very neat and efficient system I have. When one has a system, it&rsquo;s complicated, but efficient. Therefore, I don&rsquo;t have to worry about it much. Simple things have more reasons to fail, while complicated things can be sustained. But other than that, I absolutely do not indulge myself in things that I do not want to. So one could say that in that sense, I live a simplified life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>63. How can you simplify your life and focus on the most important things to you?</strong><br />\r\nOne can simplify life by simply not doing what they don&rsquo;t want to do. The other important thing is realizing what one wants to do, and planning for it. That&rsquo;s the only way to know for sure that all the things are taken care of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>64. What stresses you out?</strong><br />\r\nA bad result or a test failure. I&rsquo;m talking about my work. Other than that, I think when I&rsquo;m overwhelmed by how much I want to learn, and do, and how little time or patience I have, it totally stresses me out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>65. What makes life easier?</strong><br />\r\nPatience, and courage. It may seem difficult, but once you learn to live by them, life is really easily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>66. How often do you give without expecting anything in return?</strong><br />\r\nMost of the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>67. What is your greatest challenge?</strong><br />\r\nKeeping on improving myself and actually achieving good results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>68. What is most important to you in life? Are you giving it the time it deserves?</strong><br />\r\nThe most important thing in my life is myself, my passions. And I always give it the time it deserves. I take great pains to make time for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>69. If you could send a message to the world, what would you say in 30 seconds?</strong><br />\r\nStop. Take a look at yourself, at what you want. Live for it. Nothing else matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>70. What do you most regret never telling someone?</strong><br />\r\nHow much they meant to me, and how much I wanted to be with them. It doesn&rsquo;t matter now. They already know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>71. When was the last time you tried something new?</strong><br />\r\nA few hours ago, when I tried to use text expanders. I&rsquo;m always trying new stuff everywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>72. Are you afraid to speak your own opinion?</strong><br />\r\nNever. Unless I know it&rsquo;s not valued, or it&rsquo;s going to be thrown out the door without consideration. I don&rsquo;t waste my energy then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>73. Do you give into others too often and feel resentful because of it?</strong><br />\r\nNo, I try to do something only because I feel it&rsquo;s right by me. But sometimes I do something based on someone&rsquo;s actions, and I regret not giving it a second thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>74. Are you holding onto something that you need to put behind you?</strong><br />\r\nEveryone does. It&rsquo;s a gradual process. You put something behind every day. You say a little more, and continue ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>75. How often do you let your fears hold you back?</strong><br />\r\nI try not to. But sometimes it becomes inevitable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>76. Do the people in your life bring the best out of you?</strong><br />\r\nNo, not all of them do. The people who criticize you, motivate you, or support you are the ones that have the ability to bring out the best in you. One should surround themselves with such people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>77. How often do you make excuses?</strong><br />\r\nNot that often.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>78. What is one mistake that you will never do again?</strong><br />\r\nI will never, ever give up on something without trying everything I can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>79. Which is worse, failing or never giving it a shot?</strong><br />\r\nOf course, never giving it a shot. By failing you&rsquo;ve achieved at least one way you know that fails which you can avoid the next time. By not even trying you&rsquo;ve achieved nothing at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>80. What has grown you the most as a person &ndash; your challenges and trials or the comfortable yet enjoyable moments in life?</strong><br />\r\nOne&rsquo;s challenges and troubles are the ones that define a person. It helps a person grow, and realize the incompleteness within themselves. Then they know what they need to act on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>81. If you could choose to have no more challenges or obstacles in life, would you?</strong><br />\r\nNo, it&rsquo;s simply not possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>82. In one word, what is standing between you and your biggest goal?</strong><br />\r\nHard-work. If I can conquer that, all my goals are easy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>83. How often do you go to bed feeling angry?</strong><br />\r\nRarely. The only times I do, is because I use sleeping as a cooling mechanism when I&rsquo;m too angry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>84. Would it be wrong to steal in order to feed a starving child?</strong><br />\r\nWouldn&rsquo;t it be also wrong to let a child starve? There&rsquo;s no such thing as absolute right or wrong about anything unless both sides are considered in their entirety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>85. If you paid more attention to the sad things in this world, would you feel more conflicted about it?</strong><br />\r\nNo, suffering exists. One must learn to accept it, and look for ways to end it by the source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>86. If we learn from our failures, then why is it so bad to fail?</strong><br />\r\nIf one has to walk 5 steps to reach the top, one might fail several times on each step. But if one is in a hurry, one failed step is much more devastating. We live in a world caught in a great hurry. That&rsquo;s why failure is looked down upon so much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>87. What could you pay more attention to in life?</strong><br />\r\nHow I&rsquo;m spending my time. I&rsquo;m great at wasting my time. Because I&rsquo;m a much more efficient user of my time than an average person, I&rsquo;m also much more efficient at wasting it away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>88. Why do we think of others the most when they&rsquo;re no longer around?</strong><br />\r\nHuman nature, or psychology if I&rsquo;m right. The human minds tries to go back to known places and people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>89. What does it look like to make the most of your life?</strong><br />\r\nI think it looks like a very pretty life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>90. What have you given up on?</strong><br />\r\nA great many things. TV shows, movies, books, and loads of stuff that I do not have time for. Anything relating to them is strictly considered before being consumed. I never watch videos online if I can help it. If a series or a movie has a book, and the adaptation isn&rsquo;t really great, I prefer to read the book. I don&rsquo;t have the same notions of entertainment and enjoyment as a party animal. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t do parties. I do them wild style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>91. How many people do you truly love and what are you doing for them?</strong><br />\r\nShould I really keep a count? I don&rsquo;t think so. I do whatever I can whenever I can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>92. Do you ask enough questions, or are you happy to settle for what you already know?</strong><br />\r\nI ask enough questions to annoy someone into killing me. I think those many questions are enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>93. What were you doing when you last lost track of time?</strong><br />\r\nI was reading&nbsp;<em>Blackout</em>, a novel by&nbsp;<em>Mira Grant</em>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;<em>Newsflesh&nbsp;</em>trilogy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>94. Do you think you would be happy if you never had to work again?</strong><br />\r\nI&rsquo;d be the most miserable creature to have ever lived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>95. How old would you be if you didn&rsquo;t know how old you are?</strong><br />\r\nI could say around 30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>96. If you could ask for one wish, what would it be?</strong><br />\r\nTo help me with my life, to fulfill my dreams and passions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>97. What inspires you in life?</strong><br />\r\nThat I can choose to do whatever I want. That also scares me the most.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>98. What can you not live without the most?</strong><br />\r\nMy thoughts. If someone asked me to do mind-numbing things, or managed to distract my mind for long enough, I&rsquo;d not be sane again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>99. What do you enjoy doing over and over again?</strong><br />\r\nCreating something. Engaging my creativity. Or dreaming, that&rsquo;s creation at its purest form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>100. When did you last laugh so much it hurt?</strong><br />\r\nI don&rsquo;t really remember when the last time was. I never do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>101. What is stopping you from living the life you want to live?</strong><br />\r\nFear. And the lack of courage.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Questions originally taken from :&nbsp;<span style=\"color:rgb(4, 46, 238)\"><u><a href=\"http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/101-thought-provoking-questions-ask-late/#X8TeEEV1zF1rhTeu.99\">http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/101-thought-provoking-questions-ask-late/#X8TeEEV1zF1rhTeu.99</a></u></span></div>", "body": "<div>\r\n<p>I found this great set of 101 thought provoking questions. I answered them the best I can, not thinking much, answering whatever came to my mind the first time around. It was a great exercise in knowing what I think about many things. It made me feel like an interview, and I was really tempted to write this as one. But in the end, I decided it to keep it in the Q&amp;A format. I highly recommend all of you to at least try and think about your answers to these questions. The link to the questions is at the bottom. Enjoy!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>1. Do you like who you are?</strong><br />\r\nYes, I do. I&nbsp;<em>love</em>&nbsp;who I am. There have been times when I&rsquo;ve doubted myself, but then I&rsquo;ve always come around. For me, there are only two ways one can go from here. Either you like who you are, with full conscious measure. Or else, you start working on the parts you&nbsp;<em>don&rsquo;t</em>&nbsp;like and turn them into those you&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;like. I&rsquo;m always at the latter stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. What would people say about you at your funeral?</strong><br />\r\nIf I had it my way, they&rsquo;d each recite their favorite verse from my poems or a quote from my stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. What would you regret not doing in your life?</strong><br />\r\nA great many things, though I&rsquo;m sure many more are yet to come. My most strongest regret is that I didn&rsquo;t study computer science from a very young age when I had both the genius and the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. What&rsquo;s the wisest thing you have ever heard someone say?</strong><br />\r\nI&rsquo;ve actually read it rather than hearing. It was about worrying. If you can do something about it, why worry? If you can&rsquo;t do anything about it, why worry?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. What lessons in life did you learn the hard way?</strong><br />\r\nPerhaps, all of them. Most important of them might be to cherish and keep carefully what is precious. And I don&rsquo;t mean that in the materialistic way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. How often do your biggest worries and fears come true?</strong><br />\r\nEvery few years. I fear people I&rsquo;ve opened up to, drifting away from me. But with person, I get a little more used to it happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. If you had one year left to live, what would you try to achieve?</strong><br />\r\nNothing! I&rsquo;d simply live my life traveling and idling about lost dreaming about something or the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Do you serve money or does money serve you?</strong><br />\r\nMoney serves me. Money is only the means for ends for me. I long for money to do things I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do. But having money does not define the sort of person I am, or want to become.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. Are you afraid of being your true self around others? Why?</strong><br />\r\nA part of me is always secluded inside, and its something I&rsquo;m not comfortable sharing with almost everyone. But beyond that I&rsquo;m very much an extrovert and am my true self around everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. What are you grateful for?</strong><br />\r\nIf I have to chose one thing, it would be my parents, and then my zeal to read books during growing up. Both helped me be what I am today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>11. Have you done anything you are proud of lately?</strong><br />\r\nIf you ask me this in a few more months, I&rsquo;d have completed a thesis based on something I&rsquo;m really passionate about. I&rsquo;d be really proud of myself then. Until then, I can only dream about it, and keep working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>12. Have you made any recent acts of kindness?</strong><br />\r\nI do not believe in charity. But I do believe in kindness. I&rsquo;ve taken to helping friends and considerate person whenever the need arises. I try to help them in any measure possible, and make sure I learn something along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>13. If you knew that you would die tomorrow, what questions would you ask yourself?</strong><br />\r\nI&rsquo;d ask what&rsquo;s the best way possible to create a life-journal in one day. And I&rsquo;d ask what each page would contain. Basically, it&rsquo;d be a recollection of my entire life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>14. If your biggest fears came true, would it matter in five years from now?</strong><br />\r\nYes. Anyone who said no, would be lying. My biggest fear is losing the people. Everything else I can manage or control. But if I lose my people, it would matter five, or fifty years from now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>15. How would you describe yourself?</strong><br />\r\nI&rsquo;m not sure how to answer that in a short manner. But there&rsquo;s a very carefully chosen set of words in the &lsquo;About Me&rsquo; page of my website. They&rsquo;d be the best possible answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>16. Do you take people&rsquo;s advice?</strong><br />\r\nYes, and almost repent it afterwards. Sometimes I forget I&rsquo;m not supposed to blindly follow someone&rsquo;s advice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17. Do you get quickly offended?</strong><br />\r\nYes, I have a short temper, and very little patience. But I often try to ride out the anger. Unless it&rsquo;s something serious, or blatant and malicious, I can quell my anger away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>18. Do you consider yourself to be a likable person?</strong><br />\r\nIn the most sociable way, no, I don&rsquo;t think the average person could like me. I&rsquo;m crude in a way, and only people who can understand crudeness can like me. Every other like is superficial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>19. &lsquo;We make a living by what we get, we make a life by what we give&rsquo; &ndash; What does this mean to you?</strong><br />\r\nThe get here is everything life throws at us. It&rsquo;s something beyond our control, and we have to learn to accept it, to adapt to it, and to try and live our own way. That&rsquo;s our giving, living our way. What we give is purely ours, and it&rsquo;s up to us whether we want to give something true of us, or live a false pretense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>20. Are you enriching the lives of others?</strong><br />\r\nFrankly, I don&rsquo;t live to enrich life of others. It&rsquo;s not my goal, and I cannot go out of my way to do that. There&rsquo;s a big difference between doing something for someone and enriching their lives. I&rsquo;d rather live my own life, than live for someone else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>21. Are you living a meaningful life?</strong><br />\r\nYes, and thankfully I am capable of realizing that. Life isn&rsquo;t meaningful by itself. It&rsquo;s only when we realize and act on it can we make our life meaningful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>22. What makes a meaningful life?</strong><br />\r\nTo live a meaningful life, one must first know the meaning of life. It&rsquo;s purpose. One finds it as one grows and matures. To live by and for the purpose it to live a meaningful life. For me, my purpose is to remain true to myself. I cannot curtail my dreams, or passions because that would be lying as to what I want to do. Living a meaningful life for me is to follow my dreams and passions while trying to become the man I see myself to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>23. Would you ever give up your life to save another?</strong><br />\r\nYes, if it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>24. How much would you be willing to sacrifice for people in poverty?</strong><br />\r\nI won&rsquo;t sacrifice anything for poverty. I don&rsquo;t believe in charity. But I do believe in kindness. And I would help along for improving social conditions if I can. But it has to be towards meaningful results and not be stuck in a loop of doing it again and again expecting it to change by itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>25. If you could live one day over and over again, what would you choose to do?</strong><br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s a few days actually. The day I looked into her and found myself. I know it&rsquo;s cryptic, but really personal, and I don&rsquo;t really want to disturb lives of other people. A few other days are hand-picked ones with friends and family. The usual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>26. Do you think you are important and worthy of affection and love?</strong><br />\r\nWhose affection and whose love? If I can answer that question satisfactorily, then yes, definitely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>27. What would make you feel more worthy? What do you believe needs to be different about you?</strong><br />\r\nFor one, achieving a lot more than what I already have. That would really give me a self-boost. And that&rsquo;s precisely what I need to really change about myself. I need to do more to achieve something. I need to take small steps instead of waiting for a long jump. I&rsquo;m working on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>28. What brings you down the most often?</strong><br />\r\nMy work. There&rsquo;s nothing else that can wreck me like my work can. Every few days I break down and freeze thinking that I am doing the shittiest work I ever have done. It&rsquo;s ok, it&rsquo;s natural, it helps me evaluate my work and do course correction. Earlier it used to be people&rsquo;s behaviors, but with time I&rsquo;ve learnt to deal with that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>29. Would you rather work less (and do the things you enjoy) and have less money?</strong><br />\r\nYou&rsquo;re asking me as if I have a choice. I&rsquo;m already living that life. If I cannot enjoy something, I won&rsquo;t do it for money. That&rsquo;s the main reason I&rsquo;m doing research, because I&rsquo;m really passionate about it. And currently, it&rsquo;s paying me nothing back except joy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>30. Where do you find peace?</strong><br />\r\nWithin myself. All other places are temporary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>31. What is the most important quality you look for in another person?</strong><br />\r\nHonesty. Integrity. Without either, there can be no trust. And without trust, there can be no relation between two people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>32. What is your biggest dream in life?</strong><br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s weird actually, but I don&rsquo;t dream that far, or that big. I&rsquo;m always dreaming about the next few steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>33. What is your biggest fear?</strong><br />\r\nI think I&rsquo;ve answered this before. I fear people drifting away. Leaving me. I also fear not being able to work, or to not achieve. It&rsquo;s not a fear of failure, but rather a fear of not giving my best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>34. How would the world be different if you had never been born?</strong><br />\r\nHow would I know!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>35. What life lessons do you wish you knew 10 years ago?</strong><br />\r\nTo let things go, and that most things that we are disturbed about, don&rsquo;t really matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>36. If you could tell your younger self one thing, what would it be?</strong><br />\r\nTo really buckle down and start working on my passions. I was a very confused kid 10 years ago. I had everything in me back then, all the capabilities and abilities. I only needed a little more focus and clarity. And a little guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>37. If your life was a movie, what would the title be?</strong><br />\r\nStop deciding, and start doing. My life would be a good demonstration of why that&rsquo;s necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>38. If your life was a movie, would you enjoy watching it?</strong><br />\r\nIf it played out with exactly the same images, and persons from my memories, then yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>39. What does success mean to you?</strong><br />\r\nSatisfaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>40. If you could be a different person, who would you be?</strong><br />\r\nMe, but without all things I don&rsquo;t want in me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>41. What was the best day of your life? Why?</strong><br />\r\nI already answered this when I was asked what day I would like to relive again and again. I&rsquo;ll just answer the why here. I&rsquo;ve always had a mirror image, perhaps of myself, as the sort of person who would come along. It&rsquo;s an innocent dream, and the best day is when you realize it has come true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>42. What do you look forward to most in life?</strong><br />\r\nAt any given moment, I&rsquo;m always looking forward to doing all the things I&rsquo;ve decided to do at the moment. There&rsquo;s no specific moment I keep looking forward to. I&rsquo;m always too caught up in whatever is going on in near time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>43. What bad habits do you want to ditch?</strong><br />\r\nI could make a list of 101 things. But to name a few, letting things go, specially negative emotions. Life is really peaceful and serene without them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>44. Who do you look up to and why?</strong><br />\r\nThere isn&rsquo;t one person who&rsquo;s everything for me. I look up to many things in many people. My parents, my friends, a great many leaders and inventors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>45. Do you know your partners love language?</strong><br />\r\nSure. We wouldn&rsquo;t be partners otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>46. Do the people you love most know how much you love them?</strong><br />\r\nI don&rsquo;t really know. I don&rsquo;t want to go out of my way to show them that. It&rsquo;s something one has to realize on it&rsquo;s own. Trying to show someone how much you love them is an insecurity and I cannot afford to have those.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>47. Are you satisfied with the depth of your relationships?</strong><br />\r\nNever. I always want more. Which is why they grow deep very quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>48. What do you owe yourself?</strong><br />\r\nHonest efforts and labour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>49. Based on your current day-to-day life, what do you expect to achieve in 5 years from now?</strong><br />\r\nIf I&rsquo;m right about myself, one of these things would have happened. I would have completed my PhD research, would have earned a job in some exciting company, and would be working away in delight. Otherwise, I&rsquo;d be working for a few more years in some exciting company anyways without a PhD. I have no idea or expectations about anything else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>50. Do you say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; too often when you really want to say &lsquo;no&rsquo;? Why?</strong><br />\r\nI say no a lot more times than saying yes. At the risk of sounding negative, saying no at the risk of alienating is better than saying yes and burdening yourself with extra duties and disappointments. I can always change the no to a yes if I feel like it, but its not as easy the other way round.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>51. What did you learn yesterday?</strong><br />\r\nI learnt how little I knew about Android memory management, or design patterns in general. I learnt the effects of a large dose of caffeine to my body. I also learnt that Georgia dies, and Shaun lives, but that&rsquo;s irrelevant to others. I also learnt that I have grown in patience and control over my emotions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>52. What do you like about yourself?</strong><br />\r\nThe one thing above all, my deep, branching, analytical thinking. It&rsquo;s both an asset and a liability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>53. Would you consider yourself to be a generous person?</strong><br />\r\nNo, I&rsquo;d rather hold out until I&rsquo;m sure about the need and the merit of giving things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>54. Do you really listen when people talk to you?</strong><br />\r\nYes, I listen, I draw mental maps, and I remember a lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>55. What is the number one change you need to make in your life this year?</strong><br />\r\nI already have the resolution, to give my best. Somehow, such resolutions are never fully kept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>56. How many hours per week do you spend on the internet?</strong><br />\r\nAlmost all of them. My devices are online when I&rsquo;m sleeping. Otherwise, on an average, anywhere from 14-18hours of each day. And still, I can safely claim that I&rsquo;m not addicted, because I&rsquo;m perfectly capable of channeling my activities to other things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>57. What are your most common negative thoughts? Are they logical?</strong><br />\r\nThey are about why, or how, someone hasn&rsquo;t bothered to reply back, or answer, or acknowledge, or even be nice. I&rsquo;m very critical of people&rsquo;s responses and behavior. The more closer to me a person is, the more critical I become. I call this anal-retentive-disorder. I realize it&rsquo;s not logical, which is why I try to discard them from my mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>58. Do you think it&rsquo;s too late to do certain things in your life? Why?</strong><br />\r\nA few of the things can never really be changed. Because one doesn&rsquo;t have the time or the age or the opportunities to do the same again. However, I am a staunch believer of taking my life forward from this point onwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>59. If you could be the most influential person in the world, what would you change?</strong><br />\r\nThe attitude of people towards social norms and customs. It&rsquo;s bizarre we hold each other back so much just out of social fear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>60. How much time do you spend with your family and friends?</strong><br />\r\nDepends on what we all are doing. I&rsquo;m very absorbed in my work. But I do like taking time out and going with friends, or talking to them, but I&rsquo;m not conscious of how much time I&rsquo;m&nbsp;<em>supposed</em>&nbsp;to spend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>61. Where do you want to be in 5 years from now?</strong><br />\r\nHopefully in a better place. As I said earlier, with a PhD and an exciting job. Anything other than that is a bonus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>62. Is your life complicated by unnecessary things?</strong><br />\r\nNo, I complicate things by choice. What appears complicated to most other people, is actually a very neat and efficient system I have. When one has a system, it&rsquo;s complicated, but efficient. Therefore, I don&rsquo;t have to worry about it much. Simple things have more reasons to fail, while complicated things can be sustained. But other than that, I absolutely do not indulge myself in things that I do not want to. So one could say that in that sense, I live a simplified life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>63. How can you simplify your life and focus on the most important things to you?</strong><br />\r\nOne can simplify life by simply not doing what they don&rsquo;t want to do. The other important thing is realizing what one wants to do, and planning for it. That&rsquo;s the only way to know for sure that all the things are taken care of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>64. What stresses you out?</strong><br />\r\nA bad result or a test failure. I&rsquo;m talking about my work. Other than that, I think when I&rsquo;m overwhelmed by how much I want to learn, and do, and how little time or patience I have, it totally stresses me out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>65. What makes life easier?</strong><br />\r\nPatience, and courage. It may seem difficult, but once you learn to live by them, life is really easily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>66. How often do you give without expecting anything in return?</strong><br />\r\nMost of the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>67. What is your greatest challenge?</strong><br />\r\nKeeping on improving myself and actually achieving good results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>68. What is most important to you in life? Are you giving it the time it deserves?</strong><br />\r\nThe most important thing in my life is myself, my passions. And I always give it the time it deserves. I take great pains to make time for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>69. If you could send a message to the world, what would you say in 30 seconds?</strong><br />\r\nStop. Take a look at yourself, at what you want. Live for it. Nothing else matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>70. What do you most regret never telling someone?</strong><br />\r\nHow much they meant to me, and how much I wanted to be with them. It doesn&rsquo;t matter now. They already know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>71. When was the last time you tried something new?</strong><br />\r\nA few hours ago, when I tried to use text expanders. I&rsquo;m always trying new stuff everywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>72. Are you afraid to speak your own opinion?</strong><br />\r\nNever. Unless I know it&rsquo;s not valued, or it&rsquo;s going to be thrown out the door without consideration. I don&rsquo;t waste my energy then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>73. Do you give into others too often and feel resentful because of it?</strong><br />\r\nNo, I try to do something only because I feel it&rsquo;s right by me. But sometimes I do something based on someone&rsquo;s actions, and I regret not giving it a second thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>74. Are you holding onto something that you need to put behind you?</strong><br />\r\nEveryone does. It&rsquo;s a gradual process. You put something behind every day. You say a little more, and continue ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>75. How often do you let your fears hold you back?</strong><br />\r\nI try not to. But sometimes it becomes inevitable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>76. Do the people in your life bring the best out of you?</strong><br />\r\nNo, not all of them do. The people who criticize you, motivate you, or support you are the ones that have the ability to bring out the best in you. One should surround themselves with such people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>77. How often do you make excuses?</strong><br />\r\nNot that often.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>78. What is one mistake that you will never do again?</strong><br />\r\nI will never, ever give up on something without trying everything I can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>79. Which is worse, failing or never giving it a shot?</strong><br />\r\nOf course, never giving it a shot. By failing you&rsquo;ve achieved at least one way you know that fails which you can avoid the next time. By not even trying you&rsquo;ve achieved nothing at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>80. What has grown you the most as a person &ndash; your challenges and trials or the comfortable yet enjoyable moments in life?</strong><br />\r\nOne&rsquo;s challenges and troubles are the ones that define a person. It helps a person grow, and realize the incompleteness within themselves. Then they know what they need to act on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>81. If you could choose to have no more challenges or obstacles in life, would you?</strong><br />\r\nNo, it&rsquo;s simply not possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>82. In one word, what is standing between you and your biggest goal?</strong><br />\r\nHard-work. If I can conquer that, all my goals are easy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>83. How often do you go to bed feeling angry?</strong><br />\r\nRarely. The only times I do, is because I use sleeping as a cooling mechanism when I&rsquo;m too angry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>84. Would it be wrong to steal in order to feed a starving child?</strong><br />\r\nWouldn&rsquo;t it be also wrong to let a child starve? There&rsquo;s no such thing as absolute right or wrong about anything unless both sides are considered in their entirety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>85. If you paid more attention to the sad things in this world, would you feel more conflicted about it?</strong><br />\r\nNo, suffering exists. One must learn to accept it, and look for ways to end it by the source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>86. If we learn from our failures, then why is it so bad to fail?</strong><br />\r\nIf one has to walk 5 steps to reach the top, one might fail several times on each step. But if one is in a hurry, one failed step is much more devastating. We live in a world caught in a great hurry. That&rsquo;s why failure is looked down upon so much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>87. What could you pay more attention to in life?</strong><br />\r\nHow I&rsquo;m spending my time. I&rsquo;m great at wasting my time. Because I&rsquo;m a much more efficient user of my time than an average person, I&rsquo;m also much more efficient at wasting it away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>88. Why do we think of others the most when they&rsquo;re no longer around?</strong><br />\r\nHuman nature, or psychology if I&rsquo;m right. The human minds tries to go back to known places and people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>89. What does it look like to make the most of your life?</strong><br />\r\nI think it looks like a very pretty life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>90. What have you given up on?</strong><br />\r\nA great many things. TV shows, movies, books, and loads of stuff that I do not have time for. Anything relating to them is strictly considered before being consumed. I never watch videos online if I can help it. If a series or a movie has a book, and the adaptation isn&rsquo;t really great, I prefer to read the book. I don&rsquo;t have the same notions of entertainment and enjoyment as a party animal. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t do parties. I do them wild style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>91. How many people do you truly love and what are you doing for them?</strong><br />\r\nShould I really keep a count? I don&rsquo;t think so. I do whatever I can whenever I can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>92. Do you ask enough questions, or are you happy to settle for what you already know?</strong><br />\r\nI ask enough questions to annoy someone into killing me. I think those many questions are enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>93. What were you doing when you last lost track of time?</strong><br />\r\nI was reading&nbsp;<em>Blackout</em>, a novel by&nbsp;<em>Mira Grant</em>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;<em>Newsflesh&nbsp;</em>trilogy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>94. Do you think you would be happy if you never had to work again?</strong><br />\r\nI&rsquo;d be the most miserable creature to have ever lived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>95. How old would you be if you didn&rsquo;t know how old you are?</strong><br />\r\nI could say around 30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>96. If you could ask for one wish, what would it be?</strong><br />\r\nTo help me with my life, to fulfill my dreams and passions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>97. What inspires you in life?</strong><br />\r\nThat I can choose to do whatever I want. That also scares me the most.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>98. What can you not live without the most?</strong><br />\r\nMy thoughts. If someone asked me to do mind-numbing things, or managed to distract my mind for long enough, I&rsquo;d not be sane again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>99. What do you enjoy doing over and over again?</strong><br />\r\nCreating something. Engaging my creativity. Or dreaming, that&rsquo;s creation at its purest form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>100. When did you last laugh so much it hurt?</strong><br />\r\nI don&rsquo;t really remember when the last time was. I never do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>101. What is stopping you from living the life you want to live?</strong><br />\r\nFear. And the lack of courage.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Questions originally taken from :&nbsp;<span style=\"color:rgb(4, 46, 238)\"><u><a href=\"http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/101-thought-provoking-questions-ask-late/#X8TeEEV1zF1rhTeu.99\">http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/101-thought-provoking-questions-ask-late/#X8TeEEV1zF1rhTeu.99</a></u></span></div>", "headerimage": "", "highlight": "0", "series": 5}, {"id": 33, "title": "Being passionate is sexy", "authors": "1", "date_created": "2014-08-09 17:00:00", "date_published": "2014-08-09 17:00:00", "date_updated": "2017-05-03 20:09:25", "is_published": "1", "short_description": "Being passionate is sexy", "tags": "78", "slug": "being-passionate-is-sexy", "body_type": "markdown", "body_text": "<div>\n<p>There are people who do something because they somehow have to do it.

And this is a great attractor.</p>\n\n<p>Passion leads to a quest to find or do something about the thing one is passionate about. Even if it&rsquo;s something like following football. Passionate people know much more about football than it is evident. They know much more about their favorite teams and their playing style. They know each player and all their strengths, what the current manager&rsquo;s strategies are, and what might happen next. Compare this with other facets of their life, and one might not find the same enthusiasm or even the same degree of knowledge.

In fact, there was a phase when I stopped doing anything I wasn&rsquo;t really passionate about. Sure, I got screwed, flunked in some, and got my head back in its place. But since then I&rsquo;ve always been wondering. How to handle stuff life throws at you, especially when you aren&rsquo;t passionate about it.</p>\n\n<p>So my basic premise was this &ndash; can I be passionate by choice? About all those things that I didn&rsquo;t want to do, wasn&rsquo;t interested in, or had no choice but to follow on. Could I have made it, perhaps more interesting? Its a question worth investigating into. And so I did, for a few days. Then for weeks, and then for months. Now it&rsquo;s been years since I&rsquo;ve been asking myself that question. And to be honest, I&rsquo;m not really sure about an answer.</p>\n\n<p>See, one can always&nbsp;<em>pretend</em>&nbsp;to be passionate. One can always try to&nbsp;<em>force</em>&nbsp;themselves to be passionate. But all this achieve is&nbsp;<em>obsession and a dog chasing its own tail</em>. When you do things out of a passion for something, there&rsquo;s not much choice there. Except that you really,&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;want to do it. And when you&rsquo;re doing other things, there&rsquo;s a half-baked choice you already are making in your mind if it&rsquo;s worth your time. To be short, and fair, the answer is perhaps a simple no. One cannot force oneself to be passionate. One can definitely&nbsp;<em>pretend</em>, which will achieve its goal of fooling someone, but that won&rsquo;t help the person at all. They would never achieve anything and everything a person achieves by being passionate. Passion is pure, and unyielding that way.</p>\n\n<p>Compare everything you do with everything you do because you&rsquo;re passionate about something. There&rsquo;s a great deal of joy, and satisfaction associated with the latter. There&rsquo;s this odd sense of fulfillment, as if we have finally done something we were meant to be doing. Passion can drive people mad, but it&rsquo;s only because they want to be driven that way. If given a choice, they&rsquo;d rather be mad than not do the things they are passionate about. Passion takes a great deal of courage to withstand. It&rsquo;s not easy to follow your passion when you&rsquo;re against the world who&rsquo;d rather have you miserably living than satisfyingly dying. It takes an insane amount of courage to face every person who would rather not look at you, because you&rsquo;re passionate, and because they can&rsquo;t be like you, and do what you do. Passion is the wheel that pushes mankind forward. Every man who has thrown the shackles down, and carried the human race to the next step on their backs, gained the strength from their passion. Every inventor, every scientist, every person who has ever created something, has been able to do it out of passion. Passion is the great mover of the world.</p>\n\n<p>When you look into the eyes of someone who is passionate about something, but can&rsquo;t follow it, you see the slow black death in there. It kills you inside. And by some great human instinct, your soul screams for them to go follow their dreams. It&rsquo;s unexplainable, but it makes every person sad to see someone&rsquo;s dreams crushed, someone torn away from their passion. I think it&rsquo;s only because they themselves are a little crushed, a bit torn away inside.</p>\n\n<p>When was the last time you asked yourself, what do I really&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;want to do? It is what you&rsquo;re doing right now? Can you truly be honest to yourself? Can you gather the courage to accept the truth? It&rsquo;s not easy. But being passionate never is. It speaks of untold hardships, of toiling, of suffering and trampling. It speaks volumes about the spirit of man which is unyielding. And it shows the strengths and courage of that individual living his life. His own, not someone else&rsquo;s. That&rsquo;s why being passionate is sexy.</p>\n\n<p>A person without a passion is like a body without a soul. It merely exists for the sake of others, and nothing more. A person without a passion is like a car without a fuel. One can sit inside, but one cannot reach anywhere. A person without passion is a hollow shell, echoing the sounds and vibrations of the world around them. That&rsquo;s why a passionate person is so different. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re so sexy.</p>\n\n<p>No human is devoid of passion. It exists, in great varying amounts in each and every one of us.

At that time, it was available only for iOS, and I dismissed it since I had Android. A few months later, a small news update announced that Super Hexagon was now available on the Google Play Store. So I&nbsp;downloaded&nbsp;it, and began playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/completingsuperhexagon2.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It felt&nbsp;retro, very&nbsp;minimalistic&nbsp;and very&nbsp;addictive. I couldn&rsquo;t play the game beyond 10seconds. But couldn&rsquo;t stop playing either. A few more days of it, and it was captivating the attention and wonderment amongst friends as well. We all tried our hands, and our minds, but couldn&rsquo;t get much farther into it.&nbsp;&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;, we exclaimed, since the game could not obviously be conquered. But with patience, and days of playing, our scores grew by a few seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/completingsuperhexagon3.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, I fell in love with the game at once. It was the clean design, a well though out gameplay and the simplicity of leaving all the work to the player. There were no distractions, no points to gain, no spells to purchase and no achievement to unlock, save going forward and completing the game. I&rsquo;ve always been a sucker for such games, where the enjoyment of playing it is the first priority rather than pompous grandeur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/completingsuperhexagon5.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Super Hexagon is a game consisting of a hexagon, centered in the screen, accompanied by a little triangle rotating about its circumference. The player rotates this triangle by touching the left or right part of the screen. Shapes fly in towards the center, and the triangle must not touch any of them. So it&rsquo;s like a maze coming in towards the center, and the triangle must be rotated to avoid all obstacles. The patterns in the game are also called as&nbsp;gauntlets&nbsp;by lots of players. That&rsquo;s the game in a gist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The beauty lies in the execution of the game. The colors are always dual, a darker and a lighter shade. The walls (the shapes that come in) and the hexagon itself stand out in brighter shades. The effect is a psychedelic trip. And to add to this, is the wonderful 8-bit chip music by&nbsp;Chipzel. Playing the game without the music, is like playing Mario without its signature track. It&rsquo;s just not the same. Super Hexagon is a game that&rsquo;s defined by three things. The gameplay, it&rsquo;s difficulty, and it&rsquo;s stellar soundtracks. While the first two are attributed to&nbsp;Terry Cavanagh&nbsp;and third to&nbsp;Chipzel. It&rsquo;s all about the rage that started recently with&nbsp;Flappy Bird, but here the gameplay is much better, and pleasing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/completingsuperhexagon7.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Super Hexagon contains 3 levels, ordered by difficulty. They are&nbsp;Hexagon, Hexagoner,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hexagonest. Each level progresses in speed, and difficulty in terms of the maze and navigation. After completing 60seconds in each level, a&nbsp;Hyper-&nbsp;level is unlocked. These are called&nbsp;Hyper-Hexagon,&nbsp;Hyper-Hexagoner&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hyper-Hexagonest. Going by the same terminology, the difficulty level on Hexagon is termed as&nbsp;Hard, and progressing with&nbsp;Harder&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hardestest. The&nbsp;Hyper-levels continue on this difficulty with&nbsp;Hardester, Hardestest,&nbsp;and finally&nbsp;Hardestest.&nbsp;A pleasant female voice announces the game actions as you play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each level is further divided geometrically, starting from&nbsp;Point, Line, Triangle, Square, Pentagon&nbsp;and completing at&nbsp;Hexagon.&nbsp;The player always starts at&nbsp;Point&nbsp;which is at 0 seconds. Then comes&nbsp;Line&nbsp;at 10s,&nbsp;Triangle&nbsp;at 20s,&nbsp;Square&nbsp;at 30s and&nbsp;Pentagon&nbsp;at 45s. Reaching&nbsp;Hexagonat 60s will cause a change in the color scheme, the patterns, and the speed of the game. This is the&nbsp;hyper-&nbsp;level. Playing for a further 60s (120s in total) will change the color scheme again, but the gameplay still remains the change. Playing for a further 60s (180s in total) will change the game to the next&nbsp;hyper-&nbsp;level. Playing this way does not complete the game, for that the player has to achieve 60s in the 3rd and 6th levels.&nbsp;Reaching 60s in&nbsp;Hexagonest&nbsp;completes the game. This is called the&nbsp;Normal Ending. Reaching 60s in&nbsp;Hyper-Hexagonest&nbsp;results in the &lsquo;true-ending&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/completingsuperhexagon8.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few months back, in March (on 3rd, if I&rsquo;m right) I completed 60s on&nbsp;Hexagonest. It was a milestone, because me and my friends were at it for months, and hadn&rsquo;t been anywhere near it. I was so obsessed with completing the game, that I put in on my bucket list, the one where you list all the things you want to do in life. I played the game any little time I could manage. Waiting for the bus, play super-hexagon. In the train, while taking a break. I found a great many novel uses for playing it. Like getting rid of the sleepiness much quicker than usual. Or an actual test of how drunk are you. Since drinking causes loss in hand-eye co-ordination, playing Super Hexagon tells you just how much without going all geeky with alcohol levels and blood ppm about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So once I had finished the&nbsp;Hexagonest&nbsp;level, I set my sight on the&nbsp;Hyper-Hexagonest&nbsp;level. The&nbsp;&lsquo;true ending&rsquo;. The final destination for the game. The first time I played that level (right after unlocking it), I achieved a score of 32s. I was surprised, and pleased. But when I started playing it subsequently, I was never able to reach that same spot again. The visuals were too fast, the puzzles hard. One of the gauntlets&nbsp;made me frustrated to no ends. Finally, I managed to take a screenshot of it, and studied it, came up with a strategy, practiced, and was able to navigate through it. It took a great many turns, and each time I was getting no where closer to the end goal. This went on for months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Playing this game takes an immense amount of focus. As the levels progress in difficulty, the more focus is needed to just play it. Lasting for 60s with such sheer focus takes hard work. Playing it day in and day out gave a sort of muscle reflex to me. I could just watch the gauntlets, and my hands would navigate them on their own. I didn&rsquo;t have to do much thinking about it. Thankfully, I didn&rsquo;t have any dreams where I was inside the game, like Tron (that would have been awesome!). With the amount of time I thought about it, I expected it to happen at least once. But it didn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, playing it for weeks and weeks raised my score to 40s. Then to 45s. Then to 52s. Then a tragedy struck, where I was&nbsp;handicapped&nbsp;and forced to rest my eyes. Playing games became a luxury and a privilege and I couldn&rsquo;t indulge in it any more. So the scores dropped, and I was not playing it for a while. Recently though, I started playing it for a few minutes at a time. A week back, my high score jumped to 57s. Frankly, I was far too excited when playing to control the game. I bumped into the wall and it was game over. This happened a lot of times. Nervous 50&rsquo;s I called them. Soon though, my score jumped to 58s. I was inching nearer and nearer. Keep playing, it&rsquo;s bound to happen one of these days. I kept telling myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/completingsuperhexagon9.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day before yesterday, I was watching the news. In my hands, I was playing super hexagon as well. After a while and a string of disappointing scores, I decided to gave up. A last try I said to myself. I sat down again, and started playing. Something came up on the news. I wasn&rsquo;t paying much attention either to the news, or to the game. Suddenly, the phone blurted out &ldquo;New&nbsp;Record&rdquo; and before I could think about what happened, and realize that I had passed the previous score of 58s, I was beyond the end line. I had completed the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I watched as the entire screen turned black, and white gauntlets started appearing, coming in from all sides. Soon, the screen became blank. I waited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/completingsuperhexagon10.jpg\"  /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hexagon in the center began spewing out gauntlets it had been consuming for all this time. The color schemes switched from the last level to the first. All the shapes and patterns that had disappeared into the center, came out of it again, and flowed out of the screen. It was the best end credits display I have ever seen. It was like watching the entire game flow backwards to the time I started playing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the time it was over, I was far too excited. I had completed the game. I had finished one thing on my bucket list. I had done something I had really really wanted to do. It was pure joy. I sent messages to all my friends, and annoyed them to no ends. For them it was just a game, like any other, which I had completed. For me, it was an achievement that I had promised myself I would do, even if it took me all of my lifetime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why did I promise myself that? Because it was simple to keep, simple to complete, and meaningful. Here was a thing I liked and loved a great deal. A game. And it was tough, very difficult to complete. So I simply promised that I wouldn&rsquo;t give up, would not stop playing it. And so I did not. Now I have an achievement, a great BIG moral boost, and confidence to keep on doing something. It feels good. Starting this website was another thing, but it didn&rsquo;t have such a finality as completing the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that I have completed the game, I want to play it till I see all its tricks. That includes playing it till it reaches 180s where levels change. But it&rsquo;s not a goal. This time it&rsquo;s just entertainment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/completingsuperhexagon4.jpg\"  /><br />\r\nWhen I finished playing this, I took a look at my bucket list again. What all things I want to do. Smaller ones are in my&nbsp;Life Experiments. Finishing one item, that one tick, gives you the motivation to work on getting those other ticks as well. So here&rsquo;s a question (like I ask every time I end a story), what&rsquo;s the last item you completed off your bucket list? I&rsquo;m really interested and excited to know!!!</p>", "body": "<p>It was perhaps, last year, when I first came across a seemingly simple game called&nbsp;Super Hexagon&nbsp;that was gaining accolades all over the internet. At that time, it was available only for iOS, and I dismissed it since I had Android. A few months later, a small news update announced that Super Hexagon was now available on the Google Play Store. So I&nbsp;downloaded&nbsp;it, and began playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/completingsuperhexagon2.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It felt&nbsp;retro, very&nbsp;minimalistic&nbsp;and very&nbsp;addictive. I couldn&rsquo;t play the game beyond 10seconds. But couldn&rsquo;t stop playing either. A few more days of it, and it was captivating the attention and wonderment amongst friends as well. We all tried our hands, and our minds, but couldn&rsquo;t get much farther into it.&nbsp;&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;, we exclaimed, since the game could not obviously be conquered. But with patience, and days of playing, our scores grew by a few seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/completingsuperhexagon3.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, I fell in love with the game at once. It was the clean design, a well though out gameplay and the simplicity of leaving all the work to the player. There were no distractions, no points to gain, no spells to purchase and no achievement to unlock, save going forward and completing the game. I&rsquo;ve always been a sucker for such games, where the enjoyment of playing it is the first priority rather than pompous grandeur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2015/05/03/completingsuperhexagon5.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Super Hexagon is a game consisting of a hexagon, centered in the screen, accompanied by a little triangle rotating about its circumference. The player rotates this triangle by touching the left or right part of the screen. Shapes fly in towards the center, and the triangle must not touch any of them. So it&rsquo;s like a maze coming in towards the center, and the triangle must be rotated to avoid all obstacles. The patterns in the game are also called as&nbsp;gauntlets&nbsp;by lots of players.

Shadows cross the walls as a stray car passes outside. The boiler stutters and resumes its process. Some neighbor absently bangs on the wall. Each step of mine creaks on the wooden floor. And as I hold my hand on the handle at the door, I wonder, what if, just what if&hellip; there&rsquo;s an alien inside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s this innate fear, of the dark, of being alone, of a great many things. But it all starts with that one small seed planted somewhere within the mind. For me, it&rsquo;s a rational process. What&rsquo;s the most likely unspecified entity beyond the door. An alien of course. Rather than ghosts, ghouls, monsters or zombies, it&rsquo;s aliens that have the most probabilistic measure of being true. But then of course, why would an alien be present in MY bathroom? Out of all the places, it decides to land here. Why? It manages to do so by evading all the telescopes and satellites and surveillance equipment put up in space by humans. Not likely. Ergo, it shouldn&rsquo;t be really there. But what if, just what if&hellip; it really is? Well then, I&rsquo;ll open the door, find out, and then decide. Till then, there&rsquo;s no point in fearing about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same goes for every time I walk in a dark place. I&rsquo;d rather fear someone attacking me, someone human, than think about the other possibilities. I think left to one&rsquo;s own devices, the human mind comes up with the most deterrent response to avoid the dark. Call it the instinctive ability to survive. There are loads of studies on this. With more imagination comes more fears. Those who are well versed with zombies don&rsquo;t fear them, they know how to defeat them (if really), but those who are afraid to face them, are the ones who fear them. It&rsquo;s really the fear of the unknown, the shapeless, the dark. It&rsquo;s like Rorschach&rsquo;s Test. You leave a person in a dark room, and he&rsquo;ll invent monsters out of thin air, just to give shape to his fear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fear is inevitable. It&rsquo;s a biological, psychological response and there&rsquo;s nothing much one can do about it. But one can control or try to control one&rsquo;s thoughts and go on about it in a rational process. Like every time I am faced with a fear, I objectively deduce that&rsquo;s the likelihood of that happening is far too less. And then, why all of a sudden should I be faced with something? It&rsquo;s absurd to fear something just because. So I wait till that door is open and see actually that there&rsquo;s nothing inside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did an experiment this week. I read about aliens, like, a lot. Watched some programs on TV. Seen some horror movies. All kinds. Anything and everything to frighten me. There have only been two incidents so far. The last night, I dreamed about confronting zombies. These were ones based on Mira Grant&rsquo;s NewsFlesh trilogy. And I managed to fight them, not get bitten, and reach home. I even fancied myself to be immune based on the character of Shaun in the novel. The night before that, I dreamed aliens had come visiting. There was no absurd phenomenon. The alien craft came, hovered about our kitchen window. And a small alien creeped outside and landed in our kitchen. My response was to rush at it and strangle it with my hands. It screamed, but no sound came out. I let it go, and (absurdly!) tried to scare it off with a large teddy bear. I woke up later with my heart beating far too loudly, and my body pumped full of adrenaline. I was too shocked at the feeling, and never managed to turn my head to look around the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I later thought about it, I found some interesting facts. There was nothing &lsquo;scary&rsquo; in the typical sense about the aliens coming, or the zombies rising. In both cases, I managed to not get hurt, make them retreat or leave me, and was OK. Also, people weren&rsquo;t dying, there was no gore, no probing, no silly stuff. I realized later on, that the &lsquo;fear&rsquo; that I thought I had woken up with, was actually excitement. Of fighting. I was fighting in the dream when I woke up. So it wasn&rsquo;t a nightmare even though it sure felt like one. Another interesting fact is that, never, has it happened that I have been hurt in my dreams. Physically that is. I&rsquo;ve fallen off cliffs, been shot at, had dead falls from the sky, been in a fight with zombies and aliens, found myself in a haunted house, in a virtual game with rockets fired at me, but never hurt. It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a mental block (thank you, Professor X!) that stops my dreams from being anything but entertainment to me. It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think it&rsquo;s because I think about it in real life too. I always dismiss monsters, ghosts, demons, aliens, and all sorts of things being present in a dark room. Of course, I&rsquo;m afraid to step into the blackness, but it&rsquo;s purely a thought. I can think it over, I can brush it aside, I can have a rational discussion with myself to convince me that there&rsquo;s nothing really there. If mankind ever had their dreams come true, most would die with their nightmares. Not me though! I&rsquo;d have a gala time!</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>What about you, (those who are reading this, of course) what do you fear and feel when going into a dark place or a closed room?

It manages to do so by evading all the telescopes and satellites and surveillance equipment put up in space by humans. Not likely. Ergo, it shouldn&rsquo;t be really there. But what if, just what if&hellip; it really is? Well then, I&rsquo;ll open the door, find out, and then decide. Till then, there&rsquo;s no point in fearing about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same goes for every time I walk in a dark place. I&rsquo;d rather fear someone attacking me, someone human, than think about the other possibilities. I think left to one&rsquo;s own devices, the human mind comes up with the most deterrent response to avoid the dark. Call it the instinctive ability to survive. There are loads of studies on this. With more imagination comes more fears. Those who are well versed with zombies don&rsquo;t fear them, they know how to defeat them (if really), but those who are afraid to face them, are the ones who fear them. It&rsquo;s really the fear of the unknown, the shapeless, the dark. It&rsquo;s like Rorschach&rsquo;s Test. You leave a person in a dark room, and he&rsquo;ll invent monsters out of thin air, just to give shape to his fear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fear is inevitable. It&rsquo;s a biological, psychological response and there&rsquo;s nothing much one can do about it. But one can control or try to control one&rsquo;s thoughts and go on about it in a rational process. Like every time I am faced with a fear, I objectively deduce that&rsquo;s the likelihood of that happening is far too less. And then, why all of a sudden should I be faced with something? It&rsquo;s absurd to fear something just because. So I wait till that door is open and see actually that there&rsquo;s nothing inside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did an experiment this week. I read about aliens, like, a lot. Watched some programs on TV. Seen some horror movies. All kinds. Anything and everything to frighten me. There have only been two incidents so far. The last night, I dreamed about confronting zombies. These were ones based on Mira Grant&rsquo;s NewsFlesh trilogy. And I managed to fight them, not get bitten, and reach home. I even fancied myself to be immune based on the character of Shaun in the novel. The night before that, I dreamed aliens had come visiting. There was no absurd phenomenon. The alien craft came, hovered about our kitchen window. And a small alien creeped outside and landed in our kitchen. My response was to rush at it and strangle it with my hands. It screamed, but no sound came out. I let it go, and (absurdly!) tried to scare it off with a large teddy bear. I woke up later with my heart beating far too loudly, and my body pumped full of adrenaline. I was too shocked at the feeling, and never managed to turn my head to look around the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I later thought about it, I found some interesting facts. There was nothing &lsquo;scary&rsquo; in the typical sense about the aliens coming, or the zombies rising. In both cases, I managed to not get hurt, make them retreat or leave me, and was OK. Also, people weren&rsquo;t dying, there was no gore, no probing, no silly stuff. I realized later on, that the &lsquo;fear&rsquo; that I thought I had woken up with, was actually excitement. Of fighting. I was fighting in the dream when I woke up. So it wasn&rsquo;t a nightmare even though it sure felt like one. Another interesting fact is that, never, has it happened that I have been hurt in my dreams. Physically that is. I&rsquo;ve fallen off cliffs, been shot at, had dead falls from the sky, been in a fight with zombies and aliens, found myself in a haunted house, in a virtual game with rockets fired at me, but never hurt. It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a mental block (thank you, Professor X!) that stops my dreams from being anything but entertainment to me. It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think it&rsquo;s because I think about it in real life too. I always dismiss monsters, ghosts, demons, aliens, and all sorts of things being present in a dark room. Of course, I&rsquo;m afraid to step into the blackness, but it&rsquo;s purely a thought. I can think it over, I can brush it aside, I can have a rational discussion with myself to convince me that there&rsquo;s nothing really there. If mankind ever had their dreams come true, most would die with their nightmares. Not me though! I&rsquo;d have a gala time!</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>What about you, (those who are reading this, of course) what do you fear and feel when going into a dark place or a closed room?

Apple announced new iPhone(s) and a smartwatch last week. Everything looked very optimistic and great. The new possibilities that these devices bring to the table is great for users. The marketing hype and interest generated was phenomenal. Any rumor made front page on the news feed. Naturally, excitement reached peaks at launch time. Everyone waited to hear the price and when they could get their hands on them. But a few days later, everything crashed. Moto 360 gave reports of a very disappointing battery life. Apple Watch made no mention of battery at all, sparking rumors of a below than average performance. Interested geeks all over the world grew frustrated in disappointment.

Apple announced new iPhone(s) and a smartwatch last week. Everything looked very optimistic and great. The new possibilities that these devices bring to the table is great for users. The marketing hype and interest generated was phenomenal. Any rumor made front page on the news feed. Naturally, excitement reached peaks at launch time. Everyone waited to hear the price and when they could get their hands on them. But a few days later, everything crashed. Moto 360 gave reports of a very disappointing battery life. Apple Watch made no mention of battery at all, sparking rumors of a below than average performance. Interested geeks all over the world grew frustrated in disappointment. They had spent months dreaming of the possibilities these new devices would bring in their life. For many, this was one more step towards the ultimate geekdom dream.

I remember it being cold, very very cold! There were high winds and the temperature was exactly at zero. The next few days went in adjusting myself to the weather and the new routine, and a visit to UCC&rsquo;s Western Gateway Building where I spent the next one year of my life. I remember being clueless at the start. I had a vague idea of what I wanted to do, something about sharing data between applications on a smartphone.

It&rsquo;s not nostalgia, but a realization. When I handed over the copy of the thesis, somewhere inside me I felt the pressure of a period being written at the end of a sentence.

I was eager to write about the new things I want to do and try in 2015. About the places I want to visit. The foods I want to savor. The friends I want to make and meet. All of it had been put on hold. When I handed in that thesis, I had expected this dam to burst, with the thoughts to have come flooding in. But the only thing I felt was an eery silence. The surroundings around me reveled in my thoughts, but I could not understand why. This is also why I am writing this today, on the 9th of December, and not on the 8th when I handed in my thesis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember those days in school, when I used to rush to complete the last exam, and spend the last 15 minutes or so daydreaming about what I was going to do in the holidays. This time, there was no exam. But I still had the same feeling of wanting to simply sit and dream. It took me a while to realize that what I was feeling, now as well as back then, is the feeling of being free from something. I no longer had to think about my research, about writing my thesis, about meeting and reporting and making sure I follow up on things. It&rsquo;s like a room that has most of its furniture removed. It&rsquo;s bare. And all you think of is what stuff should I put in there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some things I want to do, not just because I have finished a part of my education, but because it excites me to want to do it. Like photography &ndash; I really feel tensed to do it because I get caught up in it too easily. So far, it has been excused because of my work and research, but now that I have the time, I can focus on it, and enjoy it leisurely. Then there is my website, my blog. I plan to write a lot more. Poems, short stories, articles, and even something new that I haven&rsquo;t tried before. For my future, I am looking at the various avenues I have for doing a PhD. And maybe a job by the side.

It feels really nice, and makes for a great memento! Receiving this reminded me of the the various bills, stubs and tickets I have collected over the past year. Each one of them has a moment, a memory, and a part of my life attached with them. I had a journal once, where I pasted things like this and wrote down little anecdotes about them. Ever since I stopped writing, I haven&rsquo;t really had a continuos episode of journalling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the new year started, I thought of an interesting way to journal my life. It is called Project 365, where I took a photo of the deciding and memorable moment of the day that would define what I want to remember from the day. And when I searched for something related to it online, I found a website with a similar name, where people post photos taken on each day of their life to create a journal for an entire year. What I want to do is, take a picture of what I think is something worth remembering, or something that tells me how I spent that day, and then put the photo in a digital notebook of sorts, and write about it. I can have as many pictures of a day I want, but at least one for every day. I use Day One, because it&rsquo;s a really nice looking app, and available on both my mac and iPad. I take photos with my phone, with an iPad, sometimes using images found on the internet. For the days that I was writing my thesis, I have a picture of my desk, with my tea cup, macbook, pencils and everything littered around exactly as I was working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the eight days that I have followed this journalling style, I&rsquo;ve found it to be immensely rewarding. It creates a habit of taking a picture of something you want to remember, and then writing about it later on. It&rsquo;s easy to do, because one can just snap a picture with their phone, and rewarding, because I can just &ldquo;browse&rdquo; through my previous week or month. Sometimes I take screenshots of conversations I have with people, because they are important, or something worth remembering by. And also, by having a picture, I can write about it two days later, based on the memories I have associated with the picture. It&rsquo;s a fun idea and something I think will cultivate into a habit for me.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Apart from all of these, I also realize that this is the first time in my life, where I have a choice of the things I want to do, with no decisive answer.

Right from childhood, one changes with each passing day. Most of the changes that happen in our personality and thinking are sub-conscious, we don&rsquo;t explicitly make or think about those changes. Sometimes, these changes are bad, they are not considered to be good traits. For example, over a period of a few months, one might become lazy, which is a sub-conscious change. Or, someone might not talk the way they used to. What I want to do, is make a conscious change in myself as much as it is possible for me to. I want to be able to think of myself as being the sum total of my conscious decisions, and not the remnant of the society around me. For this, it is important to realize exactly what I am doing. Sometimes, it is impossible to realize that a certain trait is up for a change. That is why criticism is necessary. Criticism acts like a reference or a reminder to look at a certain aspect of one self. All criticism does not necessarily have to be wrong, just like all criticism does not have to be valid. I&rsquo;m sure most of us have heard the phrase &ldquo;look before you jump&rdquo;, so consider criticism as a reminder to look, and YOU decide whether you want to jump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feedback is of all kinds, from the professional &ldquo;wear better ties&rdquo; to the &ldquo;dude, get your shit together&rdquo; kinds. All criticism is important. A few months back, sometime in 2014, I did an experiment, where I asked people to provide feedback on me where they had an option to provide it anonymously, and the feedback was open for a week or so. I received some rather strange replies, sure; but it also made me realize a lot of other things that I would not have otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Providing anonymous feedback can be beneficial not just for the person who provides it, but also for me as an individual. If someone writes a sharp critique of my actions, I do not want to think vengeful or hatred towards anyone. It works both ways. That is why, this time, I&rsquo;m keeping the feedback open at all times, with a permanent link here on my site. I&rsquo;m going to try and provide the link in all my future posts, and I hope that people would provide some feedback about the things they are thinking about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So here is the plan, the process and the project. You go to the link (at the top of the page, or&nbsp;<span style=\"color:rgb(255, 0, 0)\"><a href=\"http://whatiswrongwith.me/harshp\" style=\"transition: color 0.3s ease; -webkit-transition: color 0.3s ease; color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-position: 0px 0px; background-repeat: initial initial;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"whatiswrongwith.me\">here</a></span>) and type in your message. If you want to provide anonymous feedback, make sure the &ldquo;Anonymous&rdquo; option is selected. That&rsquo;s it, and perhaps some trivial math like what is 1+1, which I&rsquo;m sure most of us will get right (eventually). So to sum it up, this is why I&rsquo;m doing it &ndash;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Many times people, friends, colleagues and others want to say something but won&rsquo;t because they don&rsquo;t want to be seen in a negative light, or because they&rsquo;re conscious about it.</li>\r\n\t<li>Sometimes, people don&rsquo;t know you enough to come and talk to you about something.</li>\r\n\t<li>Sometimes, friends don&rsquo;t want to hurt the feelings of someone they care about.</li>\r\n\t<li>Sometimes, you just want to curse at someone, but don&rsquo;t have the opportunity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re anything but the last kind, you should provide feedback! It also works wonders for you, because criticizing someone makes you self-aware of what you&rsquo;re doing on the same points. So do it because you care, or do it because you just want to say something to me. Or, do it because you had this on your mind for a long time, or do it because you love me! I&rsquo;m listening, and I promise to reply to each criticism, with a positive analysis of the statement, and what I&rsquo;m going to do about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s to self-improvement!

I cross-referenced the name on LinkedIn, and this really was from a recruiter! My luck! How and why did I ever get the call was a great mystery. I remember one of my friends saying, &ldquo;<em>Keep a good LinkedIn profile, recruiters use that to look you up.</em>&rdquo; I&rsquo;m glad I listened to her! It had been a few days since I had given a&nbsp;<u><a href=\"http://harshp.com/brainbank/breaking-the-app-barrier-a-presentation-at-gdg-dublin/\" style=\"transition: color 0.3s ease; -webkit-transition: color 0.3s ease; color: rgb(74, 74, 74); background-position: 0px 0px; background-repeat: initial initial;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Breaking the App Barrier \u2013 A presentation at GDG Dublin\">talk on my research at Google Developer Group, Dublin</a></u>, and I wondered if this had something to do with that (it didn&rsquo;t).</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>When the feeling settled in, the excitement started in. I was so excited that I dared not reply to the email at that point for fear of saying something stupid. So the next day, I replied to the email and got a prompt reply asking me to rate myself on a few topics related to computer science. That was when I got my first scare. I really rated myself as being&nbsp;<em>average,&nbsp;</em>thinking that it is better to underestimate oneself rather than overshoot and miss.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>When the call started, I had expected to be shot with an array of questions that would test my knowledge. But instead, I was asked to talk about my current research, what I like to do and what I wanted to do. Then I was told about the job opportunities at Google Dublin, which were mainly about System Administration. I thought about the job, about working at Google, which is a dream of mine. But then I thought about my interests, about my other dream of what I wanted to be working at in life. I want to work in context-related areas, making the use of technology to do things in better ways. Sure, system administration at Google is at massive scales, and probably one of the most exciting networking jobs, but I had never been interested in it. And so, with a half-sure mind, I said &ldquo;<em>no, I want to do something else with my life</em>&ldquo;. I got some flak from people over not taking a job at Google, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure, except a tiny bit, that I had made the right choice.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>A week later, I got another email from the recruiter with the news of software engineering jobs at Google, and that another recruiter would handle the process. Great news! I could get a software engineering job at Google! When I spoke with the new recruiter, I asked about the kind of jobs I would be doing, and was told that Google hires people who then get assigned projects. And if I ever felt like changing projects, I was free to do so without going through any interviews or screening process. That was great news, no wonder that Google gets rated as one of the best places to work. So we scheduled a date for the interview, and the recruiter sent me some material that I should study and brush up on. Unfortunately, this was in December, when I was smack in the middle of finishing my thesis. So I could not give the study much of my time, but whatever I did was just a revision of graduation concepts.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>Soon the day of the first interview arrived, and I waited in suspense over what I would be asked and tested against. The phone rang up, and I answered, still lost in the feeling of awe of giving a Google interview. The first five minutes went talking about general introductions. And then came the real question. I think there is some google policy about not divulging interview questions, I am not sure. But I will anyway not mention anything specific. I was provided with a real-use case that contained a hidden problem. I had to identify the problem, and then choose the most appropriate approach to develop a solution. I was excited to go through the process. It made me think about problems in a way that I hadn&rsquo;t done in a very long time. At the basis of the problem was a graph, or a travelling salesman problem. Given a set of edges of an optimum route, how do I identify the starting and ending points of the route, and the path from there onwards. It was exciting, and I got the right approach, but overshot the time for providing the code. I was sure my solution was correct, but I was not sure that my code was optimum. I was positive about the results.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>A week later, the recruiter called me and said that while my solution was better, they wanted to do another phone interview to check up on my programming. This time I was stuck in a rut. I had to submit my thesis in two weeks, and the interview was right before the deadline. This prevented me from practicing much, and I felt half prepared as I faced my second interview. For the problem, it was all about trees, and I got the correct solution and proceeded to explain the process. But I got stuck somewhere in between, my unpreparedness showing when it came to handling trees. I knew right there in the middle of the interview that it was going bad. But I managed somehow to limp to the finish line. When the interview was over, I knew that I could very well not get past to the next stage</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>Sure enough, when the recruiter called and informed me that I did have what Google was currently looking for (a polite way of saying I&rsquo;ve been rejected), I was prepared. But I got a nice surprise when I was told that the interviewer thought I had potential and I should study and try after a year. To me, this seemed like a new opportunity.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>When I view what happened at the interview, and think what I need to do to make it through the next time, it isn&rsquo;t much apart from practice, and more practice. I could get the problems, start on the solution, but where I lacked was representing it as a piece of code. In the past, I&rsquo;ve been used to working on problems with a pen and a paper, taking my time, and going through a lot of divergent paths before settling on a solution, which I would then proceed to code. I need to change this to create a style of rapidly solving a problem, and the best way to do this would be to solve the kind of problems provided in coding competitions. So that is what I&rsquo;ll be aiming to do this year. And also revising graduation concepts now that I have the time. I plan to do a few short project that will help me develop something (also for my resume), and would help me practice writing code.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>I look forward to studying, and dream of one day working at a really exciting place.

These are called mindfuck movies as a very figurative interpretation of&nbsp;<em>movies that fuck with our heads</em>. Some film makers are famous for exclusively making only such films. Case in point &ndash; David Lynch, the only way to even describe his movies is that they are&nbsp;<em>Lynchian</em>, made by this guy. Some famous directors of today, like Christopher Nolan and David Fincher are famous because of this very aspect of their films. Their movies are incredibly clever, with a lot of details and subplots being subtle and hidden in plain view. The audience is expected to be smart and&nbsp;<em>think</em>&nbsp;about the film to get these hidden gems. It is like an exemplary book that introduces a new narrative style that leaves the reader baffled, but manages to throughly entertain the reader by its end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mindfuck movies are not necessarily movies with sudden twists (like&nbsp;<em>Sixth Sense</em>), or stereotypically being&nbsp;<em>surreal</em>. The basic premise of a mindfuck movie is its narrative, its story and its hidden layers of plot that ebb the viewer on towards being obsessed with the movie&rsquo;s meaning, the happenings or its conclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Selecting mindfuck movies</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Like selecting any other type of movie to watch, a mindfuck movie must have at least two of the

have long fallen off the head and combing the remaining ones is difficult with a shaking hand. I&rsquo;ve seen it, and read about it far too many times.

A legacy is supposed to be the desire to change or continue the outcome of a significant portion of the past, and so, logic would dictate that the person would think about his legacy much before reaching his end. By knowing what legacy he may wish to leave behind, he would probably define what kind of a person he wants to be for the rest of his life. It&rsquo;s like a marathon runner registering for a marathon a great many months later. What does he want his legacy to be? He wants the world to know him as the champion, as the person who won the race, for which, of course, he would have to indeed win the race.

Like a great rock falling from the sky into the water, rings of awareness are spreading wide around. Asking people what they want to leave behind is like asking do you want to care what people think about you after you die. As if worrying about what other people think when I am alive and living was not enough, now I have to go have headaches about what just might happen after I die. Swell. I want to change the world because I do not like it, because I want to change it, because I want to live in the changed world. There, I just admitted my sins, come hang me on a tree with a noose around my neck. But oh wait, what did you say? You couldn&rsquo;t find a tree to hang me on, did you?

Life is like that, it gives some really amazing experiences. I&rsquo;ve often heard parents describe having a child as something that changed their life. Is it the responsibility of ensuring the toddler&rsquo;s life goes along a more desirable path than their own that drives them towards their legacy? Or is it cliche deathbed scene, where a person sees their life flash before their eyes, wishing they could travel back in time and mess around to create paradoxes that would just loop endlessly like cycles of death and rebirth?

The problem with the whole thing is, it absolutely <strong>disrespects</strong>&nbsp;my right to an opinion, and instead looks to disregard any dissent I might have. Apart from the problems with Internet.og, namely the whole case of allowing access to only a few <em>chosen</em>&nbsp;sites that Facebook believes constitues to be <em><strong>basic</strong>&nbsp;</em>internet, is the apparent ploy to market it as <strong>goodwill</strong>. It is akin to the free rations governments provide to poor people, albeit unlike these, Facebook would be proliferating businesses through free access. Users would have absolutely no choice in what services they use, and the argument that some services are better than nothing is a sham behind a lot of smoke. Some services <em>chosen</em>&nbsp;by vested interests are not better than <em>nothing</em>. If it truly was representative of a goodwill to bring internet to the people, it would have offered choice. Choice to change their search provider, choice to use some other site to buy things. Instead of doing a good thing, this is totally a business venture, where company A asks company B to promote its products for x% of profits (or something along those lines). In this case, they&rsquo;re gettings more users, more coverage, and setting a dangerous precedent to the user of internet - <strong>that it&rsquo;s ok to restrict access</strong>.</div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>The problem with the so called <em>opinion</em>&nbsp;that Facebook is trying to gauge (as seen in the screenshot), is that it absolutely lacks any respect that I, as the user, might dissent with their idea of Internet.org. The only buttons shown on the message are <strong>Yes, I&rsquo;m in</strong>, which would constitute my participation and support to the idea; and the other being<strong>&nbsp;Not now</strong>, which means that I will (probably) be bombarded with this question again in the future in the hope that I may agree then. Where&rsquo;s the <strong>No, I disagree</strong>&nbsp;button, or even the option to disable any interest in Internet.org?</div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>While it their (Facebook&rsquo;s) right to use their social platform to further causes they are interested in, this kind of manipulative pesudo-support is not a good precedent. Say, 5 million people do click on the agree button, while others click on the <em>not now </em>button. Will there be any indication of how many people have decided to <strong>NOT</strong>&nbsp;support this movement?

The problem with the whole thing is, it absolutely <strong>disrespects</strong>&nbsp;my right to an opinion, and instead looks to disregard any dissent I might have. Apart from the problems with Internet.og, namely the whole case of allowing access to only a few <em>chosen</em>&nbsp;sites that Facebook believes constitues to be <em><strong>basic</strong>&nbsp;</em>internet, is the apparent ploy to market it as <strong>goodwill</strong>. It is akin to the free rations governments provide to poor people, albeit unlike these, Facebook would be proliferating businesses through free access. Users would have absolutely no choice in what services they use, and the argument that some services are better than nothing is a sham behind a lot of smoke. Some services <em>chosen</em>&nbsp;by vested interests are not better than <em>nothing</em>. If it truly was representative of a goodwill to bring internet to the people, it would have offered choice. Choice to change their search provider, choice to use some other site to buy things. Instead of doing a good thing, this is totally a business venture, where company A asks company B to promote its products for x% of profits (or something along those lines).

Sexist jokes, racist connotations, and things like that are sometimes thrown in, and enjoyed. To me, it&rsquo;s OK to laugh at these kind of things as long as they aren&rsquo;t offensive (they&rsquo;re just jokes) and they&rsquo;re not degradative (they don&rsquo;t look down upon someone). But I&rsquo;m often lost as to where do I draw the line.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Today, there was a video in the group, which turned out to be a child, might be around 3-4 years old, still a toddler. So here the toddler lay without his pants (most toddlers are, no big deal, right?); and some adult guys around him were showing him a porn video on their phone. My brain screamed right there, and I wanted to fling it as far away as I possibly could. But I was afraid of what happens next, and&nbsp;had to watch where this leads to, and so I skipped to the end. Upon watching all that porn, the toddler touches and plays with his&nbsp;penis, and everyone around him find great amusement and fun watching that. All of this took around 5 seconds as I watched, skipped to the end, and deleted the video straight off my phone. What puzzled me greatly was, how could people find this funny? And if they&rsquo;re so ignorant, how do they even think about issues like child-abuse and rape, that are filled with incidents small and benign that people suffer for years.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>My reply to the video was this - &ldquo;<em>that&rsquo;s sick, and just if you didn&rsquo;t know, could be considered child pornography</em>&rdquo; and a general&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re sick!&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;to the person who posted it. The following conversation ensued:</div>\r\n\r\n<div>OP (original poster): <em>You&rsquo;re judgemental Harshvardhan Pandit. And now do we have to set restrictions on what to send in this group? Everyone? This was supposed to be a chick free group. Not people reacting like chics group.</em></div>\r\n\r\n<div>Great! So now we also have exaggerated sexist tendencies on top of the previous issue. As far as I recall, the group was made by boys, because there were a lot of things that we, as boys, were interested in discussing that the girls found boring and tedious. Like sports, like guy jokes, like being freely able to talk to other guys without watching their language, those sort of school-boy things where being with or around a girl meant holding your tongue. But since when this turned out to be a situation where <em>complaining</em>&nbsp;was a female-only attribute is what I do not know.&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Why is it that guys expect other guys to <em>just get along</em>&nbsp;and <em>not complaint</em>&nbsp;and anyone who does is labelled to be a female in some not-so-nice terms. So even if someone does speak aloud what&rsquo;s going on, peer pressure makes sure that they don&rsquo;t speak out much far, and are immediately labeled a female, with suggestions hinting that female means something inferior or undesirable. Classic sexist behaviour.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Another quirk was the following sentence: &quot;<em>Are the boys of this group doing that child abuse?&quot;</em></div>\r\n\r\n<div>No, the boys are not, but by sharing such things, they are also participating in it, and are guilty of that. The very idea that watching something is fine even though it is wrong, only because none of them are involved in it is absurd. When things begin to get heated up, an argument comes up along the lines of &ldquo;<em>comment on the video, not on&nbsp;the person sharing it&rdquo;</em>.&nbsp;When you share something as a joke, or as something funny, you are liable for it. You are participating it, endorsing it, accepting it. So whatever is perceived as being sick, wrong, evil in that video is also applicable to the person sharing it as an act of enjoyment.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Something about awareness came up, whereby I added that <em>awareness doesn&rsquo;t mean sharing videos</em>. When people make documentaries and awareness videos, they do not show the things happening on video. A rape documentary does not show people being raped. Hence, the statement&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;So why don&rsquo;t you take it as an awareness n chill&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;is just another way of saying, &ldquo;<em>shut up, and shut up!&quot;</em></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>It&rsquo;s not long before peer-pressure comes to work. With statements like,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;I thought we;re all friends here and can share all kinds of crap&rdquo;,&nbsp;&ldquo;Everyone has their own views&rdquo;,&nbsp;&ldquo;Reacting like this makes you a pussy&rdquo;</em>. And the reverse-trap, where they spew out all the weird kinds of porn I&rsquo;ve watched and justify their actions as&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t judge you when you watched that, so why are you judging me now&rdquo;</em>. Well, for one, when I watched that porn, it was PORN. It was an adult-only business where everyone involved did something totally legal, with consent, without any form of trauma, physical or mental to anyone. On the other hand, the video that started all this featured a child, that does not even understand yet that boys and girls have different anatomies!</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Resorting to peer-pressure is the most popular group tactic all over the world. And it&rsquo;s not only in schools that boys do it, but all humans do that whenever they are in a group. Usually, it goes for nudging people to do something, or bonding, or cajoling. But in instances like these, where a wrong purported by a few members of the group is ultimately accepted and propagated by the rest because of peer pressure just exposes the woeful hazards of not standing up for yourself, or even worse, for not thinking for yourself.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>What really pushed my boundaries was how much time and arguments it took to even bring out a little realisation into people that this video constituted child abuse or child pornography which is one of the greatest evils that sadly exists today. According to the canadian law (which I found to be very clear, and specific, and which is mostly similar to all other laws on this topic):&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>from:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-163.1.html\">http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-163.1.html</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>163.1&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;In&nbsp;this&nbsp;section,&nbsp;&ldquo;child&nbsp;pornography&rdquo;&nbsp;means (a)(ii)&nbsp;the&nbsp;dominant&nbsp;characteristic&nbsp;of&nbsp;which&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;depiction,&nbsp;for&nbsp;a&nbsp;sexual&nbsp;purpose,&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sexual&nbsp;organ&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;person&nbsp;under&nbsp;the&nbsp;age&nbsp;of&nbsp;eighteen&nbsp;years;</li>\r\n\t<li>Section&nbsp;2256&nbsp;of&nbsp;Title&nbsp;18,&nbsp;United&nbsp;States&nbsp;Code,&nbsp;defines&nbsp;child&nbsp;pornography&nbsp;as&nbsp;any&nbsp;visual&nbsp;depiction&nbsp;of&nbsp;sexually&nbsp;explicit&nbsp;conduct&nbsp;involving&nbsp;a&nbsp;minor&nbsp;(someone&nbsp;under&nbsp;18&nbsp;years&nbsp;of&nbsp;age)&nbsp; Notably,&nbsp;the&nbsp;legal&nbsp;definition&nbsp;of&nbsp;sexually&nbsp;explicit&nbsp;conduct&nbsp;does&nbsp;not&nbsp;require&nbsp;that&nbsp;an&nbsp;image&nbsp;depict&nbsp;a&nbsp;child&nbsp;engaging&nbsp;in&nbsp;sexual&nbsp;activity.&nbsp; A&nbsp;picture&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;naked&nbsp;child&nbsp;may&nbsp;constitute&nbsp;illegal&nbsp;child&nbsp;pornography&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;sufficiently&nbsp;sexually&nbsp;suggestive.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div>So under legal terms, the video in question is definitely classified as child pornography which means that is an incident of child abuse. The question is, why does it take so much effort just to make people <em>think</em>&nbsp;that this is something sick which should be stopped at once. In a group of 10, most guys do not volunteer into the conversation at all. They act like they are innocent bystanders, who take no stands, and who make no comments. I do not know what they are afraid of. Is it of expressing their opinions or is it of alienating themselves by potentially hurting someone? The ones who do pitch in want to establish some sort of <em>peace</em>, or at least that&rsquo;s what I think they want to do, because they keep using words like&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;chill, calm down, it&rsquo;s ok we got it, you&rsquo;ve made your point.&rdquo;</em>. They behave as if the only thing wrong or worrisome is that I am worked up, and by calming me down, everything goes back to the way it was.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Then there are people who are so averse to arguments and opinions being expressed, that they demand that I voice my <em>opinion</em>&nbsp;and shut my loud mouth for good. I wonder whether they lack a spine, or are just afraid of standing up on their own. Why is it so hard for people to have an opinion about something that they already have participated in? Or why are people so averse to arguing on topics that would only result in broadening their own thinking capabilities? Why has the motto &ldquo;<em>live, and let live</em>&rdquo; been expanded into&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;&hellip;as long as you don&rsquo;t make me think&rdquo;</em>???</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>I&rsquo;m utterly confused and befuddled by now, as to what does it take for a person to realise that something is wrong. What action or demonstration triggers a silent alarm inside their head. Should the video have contained the child being actually exploited for it to be considered wrong? Should the video have contained more <em>violence</em>? Films and media that contain such connotations are usually hints and depictions. An incident of rape in a film is an act, a viewable demonstration of the story. That does not make it justifiable or comparable to actual videos being shared depicting similar acts of violence. Why then, do such videos of children go under people&rsquo;s radars?&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>In my age (I&rsquo;m 25 years old), people around me, my friends and colleagues would soon get married and start families. Some of them already have. If not themselves, they would certainly themselves around kids. How would their brains not be affected by this video? I do not mean to imply that they will turn into child abusive individuals, but certainly, their brains have now accepted this incident, so this kind of actions are justifiable to be done around them. They would find it funny if it was in another video, or happening right in front of them. Would they now stop it then? Where and when exactly, would their thought process kick in? Where do they draw a line?</div>", "body": "<div>My phone beeped for a new message notification in one of the boys groups on whatsapp where much filth and crap is shared that boys generally find funny. Sexist jokes, racist connotations, and things like that are sometimes thrown in, and enjoyed. To me, it&rsquo;s OK to laugh at these kind of things as long as they aren&rsquo;t offensive (they&rsquo;re just jokes) and they&rsquo;re not degradative (they don&rsquo;t look down upon someone). But I&rsquo;m often lost as to where do I draw the line.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Today, there was a video in the group, which turned out to be a child, might be around 3-4 years old, still a toddler. So here the toddler lay without his pants (most toddlers are, no big deal, right?); and some adult guys around him were showing him a porn video on their phone. My brain screamed right there, and I wanted to fling it as far away as I possibly could. But I was afraid of what happens next, and&nbsp;had to watch where this leads to, and so I skipped to the end. Upon watching all that porn, the toddler touches and plays with his&nbsp;penis, and everyone around him find great amusement and fun watching that. All of this took around 5 seconds as I watched, skipped to the end, and deleted the video straight off my phone. What puzzled me greatly was, how could people find this funny? And if they&rsquo;re so ignorant, how do they even think about issues like child-abuse and rape, that are filled with incidents small and benign that people suffer for years.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>My reply to the video was this - &ldquo;<em>that&rsquo;s sick, and just if you didn&rsquo;t know, could be considered child pornography</em>&rdquo; and a general&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re sick!&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;to the person who posted it. The following conversation ensued:</div>\r\n\r\n<div>OP (original poster): <em>You&rsquo;re judgemental Harshvardhan Pandit. And now do we have to set restrictions on what to send in this group? Everyone? This was supposed to be a chick free group. Not people reacting like chics group.</em></div>\r\n\r\n<div>Great! So now we also have exaggerated sexist tendencies on top of the previous issue. As far as I recall, the group was made by boys, because there were a lot of things that we, as boys, were interested in discussing that the girls found boring and tedious. Like sports, like guy jokes, like being freely able to talk to other guys without watching their language, those sort of school-boy things where being with or around a girl meant holding your tongue. But since when this turned out to be a situation where <em>complaining</em>&nbsp;was a female-only attribute is what I do not know.&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Why is it that guys expect other guys to <em>just get along</em>&nbsp;and <em>not complaint</em>&nbsp;and anyone who does is labelled to be a female in some not-so-nice terms. So even if someone does speak aloud what&rsquo;s going on, peer pressure makes sure that they don&rsquo;t speak out much far, and are immediately labeled a female, with suggestions hinting that female means something inferior or undesirable. Classic sexist behaviour.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Another quirk was the following sentence: &quot;<em>Are the boys of this group doing that child abuse?&quot;</em></div>\r\n\r\n<div>No, the boys are not, but by sharing such things, they are also participating in it, and are guilty of that. The very idea that watching something is fine even though it is wrong, only because none of them are involved in it is absurd. When things begin to get heated up, an argument comes up along the lines of &ldquo;<em>comment on the video, not on&nbsp;the person sharing it&rdquo;</em>.&nbsp;When you share something as a joke, or as something funny, you are liable for it. You are participating it, endorsing it, accepting it. So whatever is perceived as being sick, wrong, evil in that video is also applicable to the person sharing it as an act of enjoyment.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Something about awareness came up, whereby I added that <em>awareness doesn&rsquo;t mean sharing videos</em>. When people make documentaries and awareness videos, they do not show the things happening on video. A rape documentary does not show people being raped. Hence, the statement&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;So why don&rsquo;t you take it as an awareness n chill&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;is just another way of saying, &ldquo;<em>shut up, and shut up!&quot;</em></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>It&rsquo;s not long before peer-pressure comes to work. With statements like,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;I thought we;re all friends here and can share all kinds of crap&rdquo;,&nbsp;&ldquo;Everyone has their own views&rdquo;,&nbsp;&ldquo;Reacting like this makes you a pussy&rdquo;</em>. And the reverse-trap, where they spew out all the weird kinds of porn I&rsquo;ve watched and justify their actions as&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t judge you when you watched that, so why are you judging me now&rdquo;</em>. Well, for one, when I watched that porn, it was PORN. It was an adult-only business where everyone involved did something totally legal, with consent, without any form of trauma, physical or mental to anyone. On the other hand, the video that started all this featured a child, that does not even understand yet that boys and girls have different anatomies!</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Resorting to peer-pressure is the most popular group tactic all over the world. And it&rsquo;s not only in schools that boys do it, but all humans do that whenever they are in a group. Usually, it goes for nudging people to do something, or bonding, or cajoling. But in instances like these, where a wrong purported by a few members of the group is ultimately accepted and propagated by the rest because of peer pressure just exposes the woeful hazards of not standing up for yourself, or even worse, for not thinking for yourself.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>What really pushed my boundaries was how much time and arguments it took to even bring out a little realisation into people that this video constituted child abuse or child pornography which is one of the greatest evils that sadly exists today. According to the canadian law (which I found to be very clear, and specific, and which is mostly similar to all other laws on this topic):&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>from:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-163.1.html\">http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-163.1.html</a></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>163.1&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;In&nbsp;this&nbsp;section,&nbsp;&ldquo;child&nbsp;pornography&rdquo;&nbsp;means (a)(ii)&nbsp;the&nbsp;dominant&nbsp;characteristic&nbsp;of&nbsp;which&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;depiction,&nbsp;for&nbsp;a&nbsp;sexual&nbsp;purpose,&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sexual&nbsp;organ&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;person&nbsp;under&nbsp;the&nbsp;age&nbsp;of&nbsp;eighteen&nbsp;years;</li>\r\n\t<li>Section&nbsp;2256&nbsp;of&nbsp;Title&nbsp;18,&nbsp;United&nbsp;States&nbsp;Code,&nbsp;defines&nbsp;child&nbsp;pornography&nbsp;as&nbsp;any&nbsp;visual&nbsp;depiction&nbsp;of&nbsp;sexually&nbsp;explicit&nbsp;conduct&nbsp;involving&nbsp;a&nbsp;minor&nbsp;(someone&nbsp;under&nbsp;18&nbsp;years&nbsp;of&nbsp;age)&nbsp; Notably,&nbsp;the&nbsp;legal&nbsp;definition&nbsp;of&nbsp;sexually&nbsp;explicit&nbsp;conduct&nbsp;does&nbsp;not&nbsp;require&nbsp;that&nbsp;an&nbsp;image&nbsp;depict&nbsp;a&nbsp;child&nbsp;engaging&nbsp;in&nbsp;sexual&nbsp;activity.&nbsp; A&nbsp;picture&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;naked&nbsp;child&nbsp;may&nbsp;constitute&nbsp;illegal&nbsp;child&nbsp;pornography&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;sufficiently&nbsp;sexually&nbsp;suggestive.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div>So under legal terms, the video in question is definitely classified as child pornography which means that is an incident of child abuse. The question is, why does it take so much effort just to make people <em>think</em>&nbsp;that this is something sick which should be stopped at once. In a group of 10, most guys do not volunteer into the conversation at all. They act like they are innocent bystanders, who take no stands, and who make no comments. I do not know what they are afraid of. Is it of expressing their opinions or is it of alienating themselves by potentially hurting someone? The ones who do pitch in want to establish some sort of <em>peace</em>, or at least that&rsquo;s what I think they want to do, because they keep using words like&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;chill, calm down, it&rsquo;s ok we got it, you&rsquo;ve made your point.&rdquo;</em>. They behave as if the only thing wrong or worrisome is that I am worked up, and by calming me down, everything goes back to the way it was.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Then there are people who are so averse to arguments and opinions being expressed, that they demand that I voice my <em>opinion</em>&nbsp;and shut my loud mouth for good. I wonder whether they lack a spine, or are just afraid of standing up on their own. Why is it so hard for people to have an opinion about something that they already have participated in? Or why are people so averse to arguing on topics that would only result in broadening their own thinking capabilities? Why has the motto &ldquo;<em>live, and let live</em>&rdquo; been expanded into&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;&hellip;as long as you don&rsquo;t make me think&rdquo;</em>???</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>I&rsquo;m utterly confused and befuddled by now, as to what does it take for a person to realise that something is wrong. What action or demonstration triggers a silent alarm inside their head. Should the video have contained the child being actually exploited for it to be considered wrong? Should the video have contained more <em>violence</em>? Films and media that contain such connotations are usually hints and depictions. An incident of rape in a film is an act, a viewable demonstration of the story. That does not make it justifiable or comparable to actual videos being shared depicting similar acts of violence. Why then, do such videos of children go under people&rsquo;s radars?&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>In my age (I&rsquo;m 25 years old), people around me, my friends and colleagues would soon get married and start families.

It has an interface that is simple, clean, and consistent across platforms.\n</p>\n\n<p><br>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tasks</strong> are the primary items in Wunderlist. Each task can have a <em>due date</em> along with a <em>reminder</em>. <em>Subtasks</em> can be assigned to a task to further break it down into more steps.

It should be easy enough to complete without thinking too much, but powerful enough to be extrememly useful enough to continue using. GTD recommends segregating tasks into different lists based on when they are to be completed or acted upon, and annotating them with with useful information such as tags and due dates.<br>\n</p><p><br><br>\n</p><p>To have a clear and useful GTD setup, it is necessary to have an overview of the tasks assigned in the immediate following time span. This includes tasks to be acted upon immediately, as in <strong>Today</strong>; tasks that are to be acted upon next (after the current ones), which would be <em>Tomorrow</em> or <strong>Next</strong>; and tasks that are to be acted upon <strong>soon</strong>, within the <em>Week</em>. Then there are some tasks that need to be finished off someday, but don\u2019t really have a timespan now, these go in <strong>Someday</strong>. So we have a clear hierarchy of tasks via lists:<br>\n</p><ul><br>\n    <li><strong>Today</strong>: tasks that need to be taken care of today</li><br>\n    <li><strong>Next</strong>: tasks that need to be taken care of after current ones, or ones that need to be worked on tomorrow</li><br>\n    <li><strong>Later</strong>: tasks that need to be acted after the ones in today and next, or ones that need to worked upon in the current week</li><br>\n    <li><strong>Soon</strong>: tasks that come after the current set of tasks, such as when they depend on other tasks that need to be finished first. These also include tasks that need to be acted upon in the next week.</li><br>\n    <li><strong>Someday</strong>: tasks that need to be kept in perspective, but don\u2019t have a fixed date or time inclination. These also include tasks that need to be completed within the months.</li><br>\n</ul><p><br><br>\n</p><p>Keeping tasks ordered by when we need to do them offers a great overview of what we should be doing and what\u2019s coming up after that.

Wunderlist keeps a little <em>helper app</em> running in the background that allows quickly entering tasks from any app. So you can quickly enter things as they come to the mind, and they\u2019ll all land up in one place - Inbox. Tasks can later be moved around to approaprite lists when you have more time. This is exactly like keeping a stack of sticky notes or a notepad for a quick jotting down of tasks while you are doing other things.<br>\n</p><p><br><br>\n</p>One of the more important parts of GTD is <strong>planning</strong>. You take time out to plan and order your tasks so that you have a schedule of things to do, and an overview of things that need to be done. By keeping tasks across the current and next week in perspective, we are aware of what needs to be done, and it is easier to notice if we\u2019ve forgotten or missed something. My usual practice is to use <strong>Sunday</strong> to plan the next week (Monday onwards).<p><img src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Screen Shot 2015-11-21 at 11.10.59.png\" \"=\"\"><br>\n</p><p>The Starred list acts as the Today list, and it makes things very easy since starred items float to the top of their lists. The Starred list also shows tasks along with what list they occur in. So it neatly categorises tasks and makes it easy to select things to do. There is no strict order of things or a schedule, just a collection of tasks. This allows the freedom and flexibility to change your schedule or select tasks according to what happens during the day.<br>\n</p><p><br><br>\n</p><p>The Next / Later / Soon / Someday lists are tricky, since they require moving the tasks into the lists unlike Starred. This means that when these items need to be bumped up with stars, they will stay in whatever list they had earlier been in. One way I use to offset this is by using tags to put the context into the task itself. I always use a hashtag to denote the context of the list, for e.g. if a task is about grocery or chores, I put a <em>#grocery</em> or <em>#chore</em> in it even though the task might be in a list called Grocery or Chore. This allows the context to persist even if the task is moved around within different lists. You can move tasks back from the Next to the original list, or keep tasks marked to be done today in the Next and star them. Both schemes work well (or don\u2019t work that well, if that) so choose one that makes more sense to you.<br>\n</p><p><img src=\"http://harshp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Screen Shot 2015-11-21 at 11.09.57.png\" \"=\"\"><br>\n</p><p><br><br>\n</p><p>Clicking on the hashtag of a task shows all tasks containing that hashtag. Use this to get a quick overview of the context when you need it. For example, a tag of <em>#project</em> in the Starred list might make you wonder about what else needs to be taken care of in the project. This can be looked up easily by clicking on the hashtag, which will open up a search with the hashtag and show you all tasks in the project.<br>\n</p><p><br><br>\n</p>Use hashtags liberally if you think they might be useful in any way. I often tag things with as many contexts as I can think of. I also use hashtags to keep track of people - so I might have a hashtag of a person who I need to reply or contact via email, and I have a task containing hashtags of their name,<em> #email, #reply</em>, etc. which makes it easy to see all the emails or replies that I need to send.<p><br><br>\n</p><p>Remember, the cornerstone of GTD is jotting down ideas, planning them, and then making the whole system an integral part of your daily routine.

This can be looked up easily by clicking on the hashtag, which will open up a search with the hashtag and show you all tasks in the project.\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p>Use hashtags liberally if you think they might be useful in any way. I often tag things with as many contexts as I can think of. I also use hashtags to keep track of people - so I might have a hashtag of a person who I need to reply or contact via email, and I have a task containing hashtags of their name,<em> #email, #reply</em>, etc. which makes it easy to see all the emails or replies that I need to send.<p><br>\r\n</p><p>Remember, the cornerstone of GTD is jotting down ideas, planning them, and then making the whole system an integral part of your daily routine. If used correctly, it makes it very easy to keep track of the things you have finished and how you are getting along with work.\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p>If you have any experiences you wish to share or have ideas that improve upon this workflow, I would love to hear about them.

The audience rating was a healthy <strong>72%</strong> - a sign that most cinegoers had enjoyed the film.</p>\n<p>I was shocked, surprised, even dejected by this turn of events. Seeing Batman and Superman fight has always been something that is guarenteed to be entertaining, regardless of who actually wins. The movie is directed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Snyder\"><strong>Zack Snyder</strong></a> (<em>300, Watchmen, Man of Steel</em>), a person who has made good comic book adaptations, whose directorial style is quite entertaining for me to watch, and where the fight scenes are always more <em>stylized action</em>. </p>\n<p>I argued against going to watch something that has essentially been ridiculed by the critics, been thrown around in insulting memes, and especially after seeing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwXfv25xJUw\">this</a> video of Ben Affleck just looking <em>sad</em> - it's haunting. But I did end up going to see the movie, and I did end up enjoying it, even though it wasn't much good - but I thought it wasn't <em>that</em> bad.</p>\n<p>This movie makes more sense only if you've followed the <strong>DC universe</strong> - <em>Batman, Superman, Justice League</em> - enough to understand the various plot lines and references littered throughout the movie. Without it, everything would feel incomplete and unexplained. A lot of apparent backstory and explanations are drawn from the comic story lines, and they just show up in the movie without a bare thread of notice and disappear just as much quickly.</p>\n<p>This movie is based on, and draws heavily from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_Returns\"><strong>The Dark Knight Returns</strong></a> series by <strong>Frank Miller</strong> (one of the best Batman series) set in the distant future where an aging Batman can no longer fight as he used to, and the US Goverment has subverted Superman by making him nothing more than a soldier who follows orders. The movie shows the beginning of this - as questions are raised against the very nature of Superman's authority, and steps are being taken to undermine it.</p>\n<p><img class=\"ui centered fluid image\" src=\"http://www.comicbookresources.com/imgsrv/social_post/0/0/1/robin-social_17.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Why Batman is so angry and willing to take down Superman is a question that is really deep rooted in their history. Batman has lost <em>Robin</em> - a son-like figure who was killed by <em>The Joke</em>r in cold blod (see the Robin-suit in the glass case with Joker's taunt?) - and is filled with anger, guilt, and the feeling of powerlessness. </p>\n<p><img class=\"ui centered fluid image\" src=\"http://www.republ33k.fr/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/harvey_dent-banner.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Batman has always been someone who does not believe in inherent goodness - and so he doesn't really <em>trust</em> that every one will stay good (remember Harvey Dent turning into Two-Face?) Batman is the sort of person who keeps contingencies against his own team mates - <em>just in case</em> they go evil - and he is forced to act against them (see the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_League:_Doom\">Justice League: Doom</a> storyline).</p>\n<p><img class=\"ui centered fluid image\" src=\"http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/darkseid-batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice.jpg\"></p>\n<p>In the movie, a vision of a dystopian future is shown, where Superman builds an army under his command, is ruthless enough to kill people, and things are so bad that Batman has to resort to firing guns and killing people just to survive. The end of that dream-like sequence is Batman's death - by Superman. A very confusing vision of <strong>The Flash</strong> (that's the guy talking to Bruce in that electric time-portal thingy) is shown talking about this dystopian future (he is time-travelling) and how Batman was <em>always right</em> about Superman - that there need to be contingencies - and that <em>Lois Lane</em> is the <em>key</em>. </p>\n<p>This is from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injustice:_Gods_Among_Us#Synopsis\">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> storyline - where Joker blows up a bomb - killing Lois Lane, and turning Superman into a dictator who has no qualms about asserting his authority over everyone - including the Justice League. Things are so bad - that the only way to make things right is to go back in time and stop the bomb from ever exploding. Lois Lane has always made Superman's mind crumble like a house of cards.</p>\n<p><img class=\"ui centered fluid image\" src=\"http://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/batman-v-superman-trailer-2-001-1280x533.jpg\"></p>\n<p>This is the point where it gets really deep into the psyche of the two characters. Superman has essentially grown up to fear his own power, to try and do the <em>right</em> thing. He has always been the <em>outsider</em>, and goes to great lengths to <em>fit in</em> amongst the humans. That's why we see him land outside the court and <em>walk</em> up the stairs and in there - he could have floated (or fly) in instead. That's why we see him standing in the middle of all those people after the firefight. He doesn't really have a strong mind for a hero - he's more of a boy scout. That's why Lex Luthor is able to control him so easily. </p>\n<p>Batman on the other hand, has grown with dark memories - anger over the killing of his parents - a resolve to fight crime <em>with</em> crime. His thinking is captured quite well in the line - \"<em>\u2026 if there's even a 1% chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty</em>\" - which means that he wants to be <em>'prepared'</em>. This is the same doctrine that is used / followed by the intelligence community - if there's even a 1% chance that someone is a terrorist, we need to prepare believing they are. </p>\n<p><img class=\"ui centered fluid image\" src=\"http://screencrush.com/442/files/2015/10/Batman-v-Superman-4.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Thinking and action is not the same thing. While Batman is still busy preparing things - Superman gets in the way (this is where Superman just stands in the way of the Batmobile and wrecks it). Did Superman know that Batman was going after the Kryptonite? No, he is <em>naive</em>. He believes Batman is a good person, but he is <em>too forceful</em> (the branding incident) and thats why Superman does a <em>show of power</em> as a deterrent. This pushes Batman over the edge - he's essentially helpless sitting in a crashed car, humiliated and utterly powerless.</p>\n<p>\"<em>Do you  bleed? You will!</em>\" - that's what Batman says as Superman flies away - does he want to kill Superman? Not really. Just weaken him, show him that he's vulnerable too. Batman knows how Superman can be easily manipulated, how he does not really have the mind to take the sacrifies that come with being a hero, and how disastrous it would be if Superman snapped away even a little to do evil. <em>Contingency</em> - that's what Batman always does. That's why he has the utility belt. That's why he's <em>Batman</em>!</p>\n<p>So how they actually end up fighting? Because <strong>Lex Luthor</strong>, of course. He just <em>hates</em> Superman - because he has power far above than what he can ever achieve. So he manipulates him into fighting Batman by first kidnapping Lois Lane, and then his mother. And Superman, confused and <em>scared</em>, flies up to Batman not really sure what he is going to do. Then they fight, because Batman doesn't really like to talk things out.</p>\n<p><img class=\"ui centered fluid image\" src=\"http://images.hngn.com/data/images/full/94692/batman-v-superman-jpg.jpg?w=650\"></p>\n<p>At the point where Batman has the kryptonite spear by Superman's throat, he hesitates - is he going to kill this god-like being and break his one rule?

Saying \"<em>\u2026save Martha</em>\" is sure to fire up the Batman's psyche, since his parent's deaths haunt him for eternity (that's what the dream sequences are there to tell, where Bruce's father says essentially the same thing with his dying breath).

The day I was born into this world. An annual commemoration of that  event. At first, it was my parents who celebrated them. As a child of only a  few years, I must have been fascinated by the candles and the cake and the singing  and joyous emotions of my parents and everyone gathered around. As I grew  older, birthdays became a symbol of gifts. And more cake. I still remember the cake  I had on perhaps my 6th birthday. It was three layers, stacked on top of the  other, decked like a building. I was amazed thinking all of that was for me and  I got to stuff myself in so much cake. Never mind that I couldn't eat it all, or  could anyone else, and we had it in the fridge for days.   A little older, birthdays became occasions where I received gifts. Usually  toys. Or stationery. Anything to help my 'learning' mind. If a relative was  kind enough to offer me money, I dutifully handed it over to my parents as I  wasn't old enough to buy things myself yet. Back then birthdays were something  that were exciting because everyone else around me was exciting. Some  good things happened, there was more music and better clothes than the   usual everyday, and people sang and danced. It felt like fun, and so I associated  birthdays as celebrations that somehow revolved around me.   </p>\n<p>During the teenage years, the focus of birthdays changed from parents and  relatives to friends. Friends who went to school with me, or friends who were  neighbours, or friends whom I played with. The definition of a friend was  really fast and loose back those days. It became basically anyone I hung out  with. In the mornings, mom would  follow the Indian tradition of performing pooja or aarti to mark the blessed  occasion. I would get to wear what was called the 'fancy dress' to school,  which meant that I was excused from wearing the uniform. If a kid  turned up to class dressed in colourful clothes, you could bet that it was his  birthday. One would get a bag of chocolates to distribute it amongst the  classmates and then later take a trip to the staff room. Teachers would often  find it amusing to take chocolates, and students would often be terrified if  they just might decide to check on their homework. No punishments would be  handed to the birthday boy if they could be avoided. Everyone was  super nice. Teachers didn't pester for answers. And there was more leeway and  consideration given on the play field.  </p>\n<p>Once back home, there used to be a small party where everyone was invited,  though mostly it was just the kids. Most would come bearing the gift of  chocolates. Others would walk in with toys. Family and relatives usually had  nicer gifts in lieu of maintaining their imaginary reputation. The cake would  be brought out and everyone would gather around. Someone would light the  candles. The pressure of blowing all the candles out at once was tremendous and  a matter of prestige. Then, following a non-verbal permission from mom, I would  make an incision on to the cake while the gathered populace drudged along to a  simplified rendition of \"Happy Birthday to you\". It was done as a matter of  routine and tradition. The song never had any real enthusiasm beyond the first five  words. The first piece of the cake would always go to the parents. Then the  cake would be whisked away while I stood there receiving the lukewarm wishes  and the obligatory gifts. Someone would cut the cake in the kitchen. Guests  would be served snacks, usually crisps (or chips, as long as you know what they  are) with chocolates and a piece of cake. It was essential that everyone got  exactly one piece of cake. Refreshments would be some flavoured drink. Kids  would wolf down the food and wonder if they could get some more. Dishes would  be compared. The number of crisps versus the size of the cake. Did the cake  have cream on top. Any decorative icing. Bigger and more intact pieces would  receive more pride. </p>\n<p>Everyone had a technique of how they ate at birthday parties.   Some would eat the cake first, others would  start with whatever was savoury. Some would have a bit of everything. Finishing  the food, the kids would turn the area in to a playing field. If the parents  had to leave early, that kid disappeared. Others would play whatever game was  suitable for the number. Then they would leave too. Dinner was the best of the  best that night. Whatever dish I most cherished and loved, would be present.  Things would be bought just because it was my birthday. Even when we could not  afford a lot of the good stuff, eating the food prepared always felt rich.  Because it was made with so much love, and it felt amazing with every bite. </p>\n<p>Throughout the day, there would be phone calls, mostly from relatives who would <br>\nwish me and enquire how things were going. Listening and talking to them doing  that is the most boring thing. The phones those days were land lines,   often kept in a corner of the living room. I grew up not having my  parents call me demanding to know where I was or asking me to get home  immediately. If I knew I was getting caned, doing all those stupid insane  things wouldn't have seemed so much fun. While talking to a relative the call  barely lasted more than a minute. Two tops. Then the phone was passed to mom or  dad, and I was free to go. I would get busy admiring my gifts   or watch people busy with preparations for a wonderful dinner. </p>\n<p>The next big change in birthdays came when I moved out to stay in a hostel. The age was 16. <br>\nVery not sweet. I was a stereotype teenager, still clutching to the vestiges of  society and unsure of my place in it. I would be affected by every little thing  and everything and anything had a huge impact on me. Staying with strangers,  although they soon became familiar and some became friends later on, was quite an  experience. Birthdays became a social event. Flat-mates, or room-mates, would  get a cake and be in charge of the celebrations. They'd try their best to be as  discrete as possible, but I would always have a hint. People would make or buy  cards. Slapstick and naughty humour was overratedly enjoyed. It would be just  guys and so things would invariably turn to topics that teenage guys talk about. We would  just sit around cracking the vilest and dirtiest jokes we could come up with.  They weren't really that dirty, but at that age, they seemed the end of the  world. We would all go somewhere outside to have food. The place would not  matter as we did not have much money to spend. The company was the only thing that  mattered at those times. It is not common in India for people to have casual  jobs, especially students. Never seen a kid work summers as a casual employee.  Most would go work in a relative's shop. And they'd get gift money, not a  salary. And so there was  never any spending money in our pockets, even when we  were 16 years old, and thought of ourselves as grown up and free, and we were not. </p>\n<p>By the time I was 18, I was living in an apartment with 5 other guys. Two were  my best friends. Being 18 is becoming an adult, and it was a big deal. A lot of  imaginary doors start opening at that age. It was supposed to be special. But  apart from saying that I was an adult from then on, nothing else felt special.  I was still a teenager in my head, and celebrated my birthday like one. In  India, teenage drinking is not a thing. The society, in all its orthodox and  restrictive ways of the tradition, might just have resulted in a good thing for  once. Even without the influence of alcohol, having fun never seemed lame. We still  enjoyed ourselves silly. The kind of things that happened around birthdays back  then were classically idiotic. We had a ritual that anyone turning 18 had to go  to a pharmacy to buy a pack of condoms to symbolise that they had now turned  into an adult. It felt scary and intimidating for a kid to walk into that store  and demand a condom, especially in India. Silly things aside, there was a lot  of good thoughtful things that took place as the years progressed. It was the  first instance where friends reached out to other people they didn't know  about, and only because you cared about them. It showed thoughtfulness, and  there was maturity. It was a good departure from the birthday parties where  everyone was invited to cause havoc under one roof. </p>\n<p>I distinctly remember the birthday we celebrated for my best friend at that  time. He had turned 18 two months before me, and was the first adult amongst  us. The preparations had begun weeks earlier, and kept a top secret. We contacted  every person that mattered to him, all of them, and asked them to write a  letter for his birthday. That was the time when all of us were staying away  from our homes and parents for the first time. We all had just overnight  moved away from old friends and thrust into this place with strangers. A lot of  people wrote back. Some wrote a few lines, others filled  entire pages, front and back. We made it a point to not read any of them  ourselves. For an eternally curious soul like myself, that was one tough thing  to do. We put each letter in an unmarked envelope with nothing written on it.  No clue as to what was inside or whom was it from. Then all those letters went  into one giant packet, also unmarked. It was our own idea of a bag of  surprises. We did not give the packet to him right away at the stroke of  midnight. For dinner, we had gone to a pizza place that served unlimited pizza.  For the poor and cheap kids like ourselves, that was manna from the heavens. We  hogged every bit we could, and stuffed ourselves until we were fat turkeys,  unable to move an inch. After having ice-cream, completely sated, while we sat  around waiting for the bill, the server brought the packet on a tray and served  it to our friend. I still remember the look of bewilderment on his face as he  sat there looking at the thing placed in front of him. All our eyes, even the  staff, we on him. He opened the packet and out fell all the other packets,  and he was still clueless as ever, though even more surprised and bewildered.  </p>\n<p>Surprises are a big part of birthdays to the point that they have become the  norm of it. If there is cake, it is a surprise. If there are gifts, they are a  surprise. If there are people turning up, they are a surprise too. In that  essence, what the surprises are and what they represent changes over time. Back  when we were 18, surprises meant surprises, doing the unknown. It was simple.  It did not have to mean anything. For a lot of people, it continues to be this  way for the rest of their lives. When we reached home, I saw him tearing all  those envelopes open, and reacting to each and every one of them because he  absolutely did not know what was in them. And each one was a surprise. There  was no pattern, there was no order. They were all random. The impact this had  on me was profound. I realised that day that merely giving something  extravagant was not enough. If I cared, I had to do more. I had to surprise the  mind, the intellect. I had to tune them into an emotion of happiness. That's  what a birthday surprise should be like. </p>\n<p>The letter idea was a great success, and it was repeated by quite a lot of  people. Strangely, the whole thing seems so simple and easy, and yet, there is  something about communicating with letters that just draws the mind in. You  find yourself reading those letters over and over again. It sticks around.  The next year, when another friend had a birthday, I wrote her a book. It was  more sort of a journal, containing various things about us. How we met, how we  came close, and I think I wrote her a poem too. The act was more akin to giving  a piece of me to her. It somehow felt more sharing than cutting cake and eating  it together. We used to exchange letters before we met, our common friend acted  as the postman. I still have them, and I find myself going over them once in a  while. I wish we had continued.   But as life is, we seem to have moved on in different directions. </p>\n<p>During the undergrad years, the entire social dynamic changed. Old friends moved  to different places, and I started hanging out with new classmates.  Eventually after spending five years of  sitting in the same class, doing the same assignments, and having lunch  together everyday, the experience of doing it all together   was something that brought all of us closer.  It was in the final year that I had an  amazing birthday. Friends planned it for a long time. It was a treasure hunt.  I was blindfolded, my phone taken away from me, and then I was driven somewhere. By  the time I could see again, I was at my friend's house. It was under  construction, so no one was using it. I had clues, and I had gifts to find. I  remember gobbling down every sweet treat coming my way. Chocolates. A water  bottle, because I did not have a good one at the time. And at the top of the  house was my girlfriend who had said she couldn't come celebrate  because she couldn't get out of the house at night, but there she was. It was  pure joy. Then she rushed me downstairs and there were friends, and a room lit  completely by candles. It was magical. I was lost for words. I think that's one  of the happiest moments I have ever felt. I knew then that this day was something I  would remember for the rest of my life.  </p>\n<p>After I graduated, I moved to Ireland to pursue a Masters. Birthdays became  quiet and simple. It was the age of Facebook, and I was a very public person.  Everyone could see it was my birthday and wish me. I didn't give it much  thought. Birthdays were days when I caught up with friends. The entire day went  by chatting with people, whether it be on Facebook, or whatsapp, or even just  via calls. I received gifts all the way from India. Cards with birthday  messages in them. It felt good to be remembered. </p>\n<p>This year, I changed my Facebook birthday from public to private,   essentially hiding it from everyone. And it made a  huge change in how the birthday went. I realised how much people depended on  Facebook to remember birthdays, or to react to them. The birthday went  surprisingly quiet. People did not wish me at all. New people did not wish me,  true, but old friends forgot as well. Some intentionally, some accidentally. At  first, I was immensely surprised - how could everyone forget a birthday. Not a  single message on my timeline, except one from my maternal aunt, bless her. The  few friends who remembered it and planned for it had not made it a public  occasion, which was good. We had food, we had good alcohol, we talked a bit,  then we slept. We woke up the next day, had breakfast, and came back to work. I worked till  the evening, and then we had ice-cream. I went home and slept. The birthday  went by peaceful and quiet. No phone calls, no messages, no surprises. The lack  of anything happening was a surprise in itself. </p>\n<p>A few friends wished in the common whatsapp group. I dislike that, I avoided  using the word hate. I simply do not get the point of wishing in a group, the  attitude and mentality seems to me of avoiding personal interactions, but being  'safe' by wishing in a social context. How infuriating! One friend called,  and it was more of a catch-up call as it had been a while. It felt good to talk  to someone, and she knew better than to go over the usual \"So, what's special  for today?\" questions. Another friend sent a truly heartfelt message. She wrote  it honestly, and I can say that because I've known her a long time. It would  have been better if I could have spent the day with her in the tulip fields of  Netherlands. But one can't get everything they want, can they? Surprising was  the fact that in a social gathering, even whatsapp groups, people see others  wishing but don't wish themselves. It is truly puzzling, and makes me curious  with respect to the psychology that goes behind it. One friend I was waiting to hear from  didn't wish, though I knew he remembered my birthday, but I kept dismissing it saying  he'll probably call at the last minute. He didn't. It made me sad, but I  decided to not think about it. He did call the next day though, and we had a  long chat about what was happening in our lives. You understand how much the  person cares about you by the quality of the conversation, and by how genuinely  they tell you that they forgot. Honesty, that's a great quality. </p>\n<p>Once all the birthday amusements were over,   I realised how much of an adult I had just become. I knew when I talked with  people after a few days, and mentioned the birthday I had last week, it would  be no big deal. Usually, people in my lab celebrate a birthday with a cake. It  didn't happen for me, but then, was it necessary? Do I have to depend on others  to make my birthday special? I was utterly perplexed that day, and on the days  that followed. A hint of sadness and disappointment later, I realised that all  these years the only thing keeping the birthdays a happy occasion was myself  believing it was so. With age, birthdays become more symbolic rather than the festival  I had always thought them to be. It was quite surprising to note that people whom I had wished,  or who were good friends, or someone I had gifted something on their birthday  as a token of appreciation, simply forgot to wish me. Was I at fault here for making my  birthday private on Facebook? The issue seemed very philosophical. </p>\n<p>If I want others to remember and celebrate my birthday, I should have kept the  birthday public. Since I did not, people would not remember it, and that should  not be a surprise. Later on, if the date does come up, a lot of people would  simply not react to hide the fact that they missed it, or they just don't care.  In all of this, I found something I call the adult birthday. I always was  surprised and curious to note that one of my friends, he's quite older than me  (by a decade, not less), would not be enthusiastic about birthdays at all. This  year, I finally agree with me. I'll happily trade a day full of messages and  cakes and gifts for the few people who genuinely care enough to be there  regardless of what day it is. </p>\n<p>Dear self, welcome to the adult world.</p>", "body": "Birthday.

It was three layers, stacked on top of the  other, decked like a building. I was amazed thinking all of that was for me and  I got to stuff myself in so much cake. Never mind that I couldn't eat it all, or  could anyone else, and we had it in the fridge for days.   A little older, birthdays became occasions where I received gifts. Usually  toys. Or stationery. Anything to help my 'learning' mind. If a relative was  kind enough to offer me money, I dutifully handed it over to my parents as I  wasn't old enough to buy things myself yet. Back then birthdays were something  that were exciting because everyone else around me was exciting. Some  good things happened, there was more music and better clothes than the   usual everyday, and people sang and danced. It felt like fun, and so I associated  birthdays as celebrations that somehow revolved around me.   \r\n\r\nDuring the teenage years, the focus of birthdays changed from parents and  relatives to friends. Friends who went to school with me, or friends who were  neighbours, or friends whom I played with. The definition of a friend was  really fast and loose back those days. It became basically anyone I hung out  with. In the mornings, mom would  follow the Indian tradition of performing pooja or aarti to mark the blessed  occasion. I would get to wear what was called the 'fancy dress' to school,  which meant that I was excused from wearing the uniform. If a kid  turned up to class dressed in colourful clothes, you could bet that it was his  birthday. One would get a bag of chocolates to distribute it amongst the  classmates and then later take a trip to the staff room. Teachers would often  find it amusing to take chocolates, and students would often be terrified if  they just might decide to check on their homework. No punishments would be  handed to the birthday boy if they could be avoided. Everyone was  super nice. Teachers didn't pester for answers. And there was more leeway and  consideration given on the play field.  \r\n \r\nOnce back home, there used to be a small party where everyone was invited,  though mostly it was just the kids. Most would come bearing the gift of  chocolates. Others would walk in with toys. Family and relatives usually had  nicer gifts in lieu of maintaining their imaginary reputation. The cake would  be brought out and everyone would gather around. Someone would light the  candles. The pressure of blowing all the candles out at once was tremendous and  a matter of prestige. Then, following a non-verbal permission from mom, I would  make an incision on to the cake while the gathered populace drudged along to a  simplified rendition of \"Happy Birthday to you\". It was done as a matter of  routine and tradition. The song never had any real enthusiasm beyond the first five  words. The first piece of the cake would always go to the parents. Then the  cake would be whisked away while I stood there receiving the lukewarm wishes  and the obligatory gifts. Someone would cut the cake in the kitchen. Guests  would be served snacks, usually crisps (or chips, as long as you know what they  are) with chocolates and a piece of cake. It was essential that everyone got  exactly one piece of cake. Refreshments would be some flavoured drink. Kids  would wolf down the food and wonder if they could get some more. Dishes would  be compared. The number of crisps versus the size of the cake. Did the cake  have cream on top. Any decorative icing. Bigger and more intact pieces would  receive more pride. \r\n \r\nEveryone had a technique of how they ate at birthday parties.   Some would eat the cake first, others would  start with whatever was savoury. Some would have a bit of everything. Finishing  the food, the kids would turn the area in to a playing field. If the parents  had to leave early, that kid disappeared. Others would play whatever game was  suitable for the number. Then they would leave too. Dinner was the best of the  best that night. Whatever dish I most cherished and loved, would be present.  Things would be bought just because it was my birthday. Even when we could not  afford a lot of the good stuff, eating the food prepared always felt rich.  Because it was made with so much love, and it felt amazing with every bite. \r\n \r\nThroughout the day, there would be phone calls, mostly from relatives who would \r\nwish me and enquire how things were going. Listening and talking to them doing  that is the most boring thing. The phones those days were land lines,   often kept in a corner of the living room. I grew up not having my  parents call me demanding to know where I was or asking me to get home  immediately. If I knew I was getting caned, doing all those stupid insane  things wouldn't have seemed so much fun. While talking to a relative the call  barely lasted more than a minute. Two tops. Then the phone was passed to mom or  dad, and I was free to go. I would get busy admiring my gifts   or watch people busy with preparations for a wonderful dinner. \r\n \r\nThe next big change in birthdays came when I moved out to stay in a hostel. The age was 16. \r\nVery not sweet. I was a stereotype teenager, still clutching to the vestiges of  society and unsure of my place in it. I would be affected by every little thing  and everything and anything had a huge impact on me. Staying with strangers,  although they soon became familiar and some became friends later on, was quite an  experience. Birthdays became a social event. Flat-mates, or room-mates, would  get a cake and be in charge of the celebrations. They'd try their best to be as  discrete as possible, but I would always have a hint. People would make or buy  cards. Slapstick and naughty humour was overratedly enjoyed. It would be just  guys and so things would invariably turn to topics that teenage guys talk about. We would  just sit around cracking the vilest and dirtiest jokes we could come up with.  They weren't really that dirty, but at that age, they seemed the end of the  world. We would all go somewhere outside to have food. The place would not  matter as we did not have much money to spend. The company was the only thing that  mattered at those times. It is not common in India for people to have casual  jobs, especially students. Never seen a kid work summers as a casual employee.  Most would go work in a relative's shop. And they'd get gift money, not a  salary. And so there was  never any spending money in our pockets, even when we  were 16 years old, and thought of ourselves as grown up and free, and we were not. \r\n \r\nBy the time I was 18, I was living in an apartment with 5 other guys. Two were  my best friends. Being 18 is becoming an adult, and it was a big deal. A lot of  imaginary doors start opening at that age. It was supposed to be special. But  apart from saying that I was an adult from then on, nothing else felt special.  I was still a teenager in my head, and celebrated my birthday like one. In  India, teenage drinking is not a thing. The society, in all its orthodox and  restrictive ways of the tradition, might just have resulted in a good thing for  once. Even without the influence of alcohol, having fun never seemed lame. We still  enjoyed ourselves silly. The kind of things that happened around birthdays back  then were classically idiotic. We had a ritual that anyone turning 18 had to go  to a pharmacy to buy a pack of condoms to symbolise that they had now turned  into an adult. It felt scary and intimidating for a kid to walk into that store  and demand a condom, especially in India. Silly things aside, there was a lot  of good thoughtful things that took place as the years progressed. It was the  first instance where friends reached out to other people they didn't know  about, and only because you cared about them. It showed thoughtfulness, and  there was maturity. It was a good departure from the birthday parties where  everyone was invited to cause havoc under one roof. \r\n \r\nI distinctly remember the birthday we celebrated for my best friend at that  time. He had turned 18 two months before me, and was the first adult amongst  us. The preparations had begun weeks earlier, and kept a top secret. We contacted  every person that mattered to him, all of them, and asked them to write a  letter for his birthday. That was the time when all of us were staying away  from our homes and parents for the first time. We all had just overnight  moved away from old friends and thrust into this place with strangers. A lot of  people wrote back. Some wrote a few lines, others filled  entire pages, front and back. We made it a point to not read any of them  ourselves. For an eternally curious soul like myself, that was one tough thing  to do. We put each letter in an unmarked envelope with nothing written on it.  No clue as to what was inside or whom was it from. Then all those letters went  into one giant packet, also unmarked. It was our own idea of a bag of  surprises. We did not give the packet to him right away at the stroke of  midnight. For dinner, we had gone to a pizza place that served unlimited pizza.  For the poor and cheap kids like ourselves, that was manna from the heavens. We  hogged every bit we could, and stuffed ourselves until we were fat turkeys,  unable to move an inch. After having ice-cream, completely sated, while we sat  around waiting for the bill, the server brought the packet on a tray and served  it to our friend. I still remember the look of bewilderment on his face as he  sat there looking at the thing placed in front of him. All our eyes, even the  staff, we on him. He opened the packet and out fell all the other packets,  and he was still clueless as ever, though even more surprised and bewildered.  \r\n \r\nSurprises are a big part of birthdays to the point that they have become the  norm of it. If there is cake, it is a surprise. If there are gifts, they are a  surprise. If there are people turning up, they are a surprise too. In that  essence, what the surprises are and what they represent changes over time. Back  when we were 18, surprises meant surprises, doing the unknown. It was simple.  It did not have to mean anything. For a lot of people, it continues to be this  way for the rest of their lives. When we reached home, I saw him tearing all  those envelopes open, and reacting to each and every one of them because he  absolutely did not know what was in them. And each one was a surprise. There  was no pattern, there was no order. They were all random. The impact this had  on me was profound. I realised that day that merely giving something  extravagant was not enough. If I cared, I had to do more. I had to surprise the  mind, the intellect. I had to tune them into an emotion of happiness. That's  what a birthday surprise should be like. \r\n \r\nThe letter idea was a great success, and it was repeated by quite a lot of  people. Strangely, the whole thing seems so simple and easy, and yet, there is  something about communicating with letters that just draws the mind in. You  find yourself reading those letters over and over again. It sticks around.  The next year, when another friend had a birthday, I wrote her a book. It was  more sort of a journal, containing various things about us. How we met, how we  came close, and I think I wrote her a poem too. The act was more akin to giving  a piece of me to her. It somehow felt more sharing than cutting cake and eating  it together. We used to exchange letters before we met, our common friend acted  as the postman. I still have them, and I find myself going over them once in a  while. I wish we had continued.   But as life is, we seem to have moved on in different directions. \r\n \r\nDuring the undergrad years, the entire social dynamic changed. Old friends moved  to different places, and I started hanging out with new classmates.  Eventually after spending five years of  sitting in the same class, doing the same assignments, and having lunch  together everyday, the experience of doing it all together   was something that brought all of us closer.  It was in the final year that I had an  amazing birthday. Friends planned it for a long time. It was a treasure hunt.  I was blindfolded, my phone taken away from me, and then I was driven somewhere. By  the time I could see again, I was at my friend's house. It was under  construction, so no one was using it. I had clues, and I had gifts to find. I  remember gobbling down every sweet treat coming my way. Chocolates. A water  bottle, because I did not have a good one at the time. And at the top of the  house was my girlfriend who had said she couldn't come celebrate  because she couldn't get out of the house at night, but there she was. It was  pure joy. Then she rushed me downstairs and there were friends, and a room lit  completely by candles. It was magical. I was lost for words. I think that's one  of the happiest moments I have ever felt. I knew then that this day was something I  would remember for the rest of my life.  \r\n \r\nAfter I graduated, I moved to Ireland to pursue a Masters. Birthdays became  quiet and simple. It was the age of Facebook, and I was a very public person.  Everyone could see it was my birthday and wish me. I didn't give it much  thought. Birthdays were days when I caught up with friends. The entire day went  by chatting with people, whether it be on Facebook, or whatsapp, or even just  via calls. I received gifts all the way from India. Cards with birthday  messages in them. It felt good to be remembered. \r\n \r\nThis year, I changed my Facebook birthday from public to private,   essentially hiding it from everyone. And it made a  huge change in how the birthday went. I realised how much people depended on  Facebook to remember birthdays, or to react to them. The birthday went  surprisingly quiet. People did not wish me at all. New people did not wish me,  true, but old friends forgot as well. Some intentionally, some accidentally. At  first, I was immensely surprised - how could everyone forget a birthday. Not a  single message on my timeline, except one from my maternal aunt, bless her. The  few friends who remembered it and planned for it had not made it a public  occasion, which was good. We had food, we had good alcohol, we talked a bit,  then we slept. We woke up the next day, had breakfast, and came back to work. I worked till  the evening, and then we had ice-cream. I went home and slept. The birthday  went by peaceful and quiet. No phone calls, no messages, no surprises. The lack  of anything happening was a surprise in itself. \r\n \r\nA few friends wished in the common whatsapp group. I dislike that, I avoided  using the word hate. I simply do not get the point of wishing in a group, the  attitude and mentality seems to me of avoiding personal interactions, but being  'safe' by wishing in a social context. How infuriating! One friend called,  and it was more of a catch-up call as it had been a while. It felt good to talk  to someone, and she knew better than to go over the usual \"So, what's special  for today?\" questions. Another friend sent a truly heartfelt message. She wrote  it honestly, and I can say that because I've known her a long time. It would  have been better if I could have spent the day with her in the tulip fields of  Netherlands. But one can't get everything they want, can they? Surprising was  the fact that in a social gathering, even whatsapp groups, people see others  wishing but don't wish themselves. It is truly puzzling, and makes me curious  with respect to the psychology that goes behind it. One friend I was waiting to hear from  didn't wish, though I knew he remembered my birthday, but I kept dismissing it saying  he'll probably call at the last minute. He didn't. It made me sad, but I  decided to not think about it. He did call the next day though, and we had a  long chat about what was happening in our lives. You understand how much the  person cares about you by the quality of the conversation, and by how genuinely  they tell you that they forgot. Honesty, that's a great quality. \r\n \r\nOnce all the birthday amusements were over,   I realised how much of an adult I had just become. I knew when I talked with  people after a few days, and mentioned the birthday I had last week, it would  be no big deal. Usually, people in my lab celebrate a birthday with a cake. It  didn't happen for me, but then, was it necessary? Do I have to depend on others  to make my birthday special? I was utterly perplexed that day, and on the days  that followed. A hint of sadness and disappointment later, I realised that all  these years the only thing keeping the birthdays a happy occasion was myself  believing it was so. With age, birthdays become more symbolic rather than the festival  I had always thought them to be. It was quite surprising to note that people whom I had wished,  or who were good friends, or someone I had gifted something on their birthday  as a token of appreciation, simply forgot to wish me. Was I at fault here for making my  birthday private on Facebook? The issue seemed very philosophical. \r\n \r\nIf I want others to remember and celebrate my birthday, I should have kept the  birthday public. Since I did not, people would not remember it, and that should  not be a surprise. Later on, if the date does come up, a lot of people would  simply not react to hide the fact that they missed it, or they just don't care.  In all of this, I found something I call the adult birthday. I always was  surprised and curious to note that one of my friends, he's quite older than me  (by a decade, not less), would not be enthusiastic about birthdays at all. This  year, I finally agree with me. I'll happily trade a day full of messages and  cakes and gifts for the few people who genuinely care enough to be there  regardless of what day it is. \r\n\r\nDear self, welcome to the adult world.", "headerimage": "https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/harshp-media/media/2017/birthdays.jpg", "highlight": "1", "series": 5}, {"id": 20, "title": "9 Nov'16  - a wake up call to all", "authors": "1", "date_created": "2016-11-10 00:37:00", "date_published": "2016-11-10 00:37:00", "date_updated": "2016-11-10 00:43:13", "is_published": "1", "short_description": "Why the day is a wake up all, especially after Brexit.
