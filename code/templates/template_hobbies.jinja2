    Wikipedia defines <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby"><i>hobby</i></a> as an activity
    done for enjoyment and entertainment during one's leisure time. People have
    many kinds of hobbies, and anything that can be done for enjoyment can be
    considered a hobby.
</p>
<p>
    I too, over the years, have cultivated many different hobbies. Some of them
    have lasted into adulthood - such as reading - and some others have lapsed
    into distant memories - such as matchbox collections. Regardless, I intend
    to keep a record of them here for pleasure - maybe this counts as a hobby
    too!

        <h2>Creative Writing</h2>
        <p>I like writing - it helps stretch and form the imagination like kneading dough and baking it into a delicious tasting item. I write <a href="/stories"><b>stories</b></a> to explore emotions, philosophy, science, fiction, society, and relations. I write <a href="/poems"><b>poetry</b></a> as a more constrained form to express some core emotion or feeling. Writing them takes time, and is infrequent. I'm trying to keep <a href="/stories/ideas">track of ideas</a> these days instead so I can hopefully turn some of them into creative pieces one day.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Books</h2>
        <p>I'm a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliophilia"><i>bibliophile</i></a> - a person who loves books and loves reading. Also known more colloquially as a bookworm. I like to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction">science fiction</a> the most - a genre that kick-started my imagination and love of reading. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne">Jules Verne</a> will forever be my first love in reading, and an inspiration in imagining. These days I try to read a more variety of genres - social, drama, crime, noir, historical fiction. While this kind of reading is more tied to pleasure, I'm also trying to read more non-fiction as an educational exercise.</p>
        <p>I keep a <a href="/hobbies/books">record of books</a> that I've read or want to read. I'm also trying to maintain lists of books for suggestion and recommendation to others.</p>
    </li>

        <h2>Movies & TV-Shows</h2>
        <p>Movies are perhaps the greatest form of fictional entertainment we have created. And I say that because watching a movie requires nothing - no literacy, no knowledge. We are born ready to watch. Well, it does require vision. And then not all movies are enjoyable to everyone. Yet, the pull of a movie is unparalleled in our society. It is short, concise, complete (mostly).</p>
        <p>TV Shows are a longer format, and therefore have the freedom to provide more depth and variety in offerings. They also are a continuous affair and can afford to be slow and build the world and characters a lot more. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Food</h2>
        <p>Apart from being essential to survive, food can be a great source of pleasure. The taste buds used to indicate whether something is more preferable and desirable to the body are also useful as a source of enjoyment - similar to other bodily functions. The term <i>foodgasm</i> refers to an intense feeling of pleasure derived from tasting something - similar to an orgasm. I enjoy eating different kinds of cheese (trying to eat them all!), trying out teas and coffee varieties, and gouging on pizzas and world cuisines.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>The auditory pleasures are yet unexplained - why do we love music? Why do we like certain songs and tunes? Regardless, the process of discovering what we like in terms of music is a joy in itself. I try to listen to a variety of musical genres - from classical to hard rock, but try to stay away from the extremes. My musical inclinations depend mostly on what I'm doing at the time - programming will invite more electronic and repetitive music, chores will invite EDM or Pop, writing a paper will require classical or non-lyrical ambient sounds. I'm currently using <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/coolharsh55">Spotify</a> to stream music.</p>
