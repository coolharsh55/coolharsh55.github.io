<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath"><b>polymath</b></a> is a person whose knowledge spans across several different areas and topics. In today's world, it is common to specialise in one area, discipline, or profession. But instead, I want to learn about many different things as a personal hobby, and while I have a <a href="/research">specific job</a>, there are other areas of knowledge that are not related to it which I want to learn. The process of deciding what to learn and educating oneself about it is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism">autodidacticism</a>. On this page I list topics I'm interested in, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Overviews">Wikipedia's Contents/Overviews</a>.</p>

<p>A (temporary) brief and rudimentary list of topics I'm interested in learning is as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Biology</li>
    <li>Philosophy</li>
    <li>Physics - Mechanics, Quantum Field Theory</li>
    <li>Chemistry</li>
    <li>Astronomy</li>
    <li>(Mechanical) Engineering</li>
    <li>Computer Science</li>
</ul>
