# Tomme au Marc de Raisin
# variation of Tomme French cheese with Grape skin leftover from wine making

# for having an easy way to write about food realted hobbies, such as coffee, tea, pasta, and cheese, have a query that retrieves all items ordered by hiearchy, i.e. Top --> Mid --> Low --> Top - and so on. Then have for loops that go, for each Top create <h2>, then for Mids create <h3> then for Lows onwards create nested <ul>.
