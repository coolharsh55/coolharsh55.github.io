<p>I moved my earlier system which used Manjaro Linux to EndeavourOS. Both are "arch-based", but Manjaro was more like Ubuntu to Debian in that it controlled the packages and inserted additional stuff as its own packages. It is supposed to be beginner friendly, but I think over time it is better to figure out how stuff works and move to an actual arch distribution. I'm quite familiar with linux environments (though not <i>too familiar</i>), so when the system just refused to work correctly one particular update later, where I kept getting a blank screen after boot (graphics card problems?) - I thought it was the perfect time to switch. I had to install a lot of packages in an ad-hoc manner as I remembered I needed to use some software or utility. So I created this page to list all the packages that I'm installing.</p>

    <h2>Which flavour of linux?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Definitely settled on arch  - but not manjaro which holds back packages, has its own repos which cause issues with AUR, and in general doesn't seem well-liked to fit within the arch community. Of the arch distributions, endeavour and arco seemed the best fit. I went with endeavour as it looked simple and polished.</li>
        <li>opensuse tumbleweed is a good contender for second choice</li>
        <li>popOS is popular as a gaming friendly distro</li>
        <li>not fedora, not ubuntu, not debian, gentoo? - haha, no</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Which filesystem?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>btrfs is a newer (relatively) fs that has great snapshot and backup capability</li>
        <li>ext4 is the default, no issues, just works</li>
        <li>ntfs if a drive is shared with windows and already exists, otherwise exFAT seems to be the choice to avoid permissions wrangling in linux (use ntfs-36 and ntfsfix otherwise)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Which window manager?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>i3 is the WM of choice - simple, no GUI to manage, everything is full screen or tiled, and keyboard navigations is breezy; also I have a setup built over the years that is too comfortable to change</li>
        <li>xfce is the logical choice to have a simple wm complementing i3 for things not provided e.g. network manager, file browser, terminal; also good as a fallback desktop</li>
        <li>kde plasma nice to have for ensuring everything works; also comes with additional things not in xfce like sddm (login manager), kwallet (password keychain) - which avoids having to install gnome</li>
    </ul>
