# Firefox Containers - great idea, wonky implementation

[Firefox Containers](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers) are a great idea. They allow separating website (and their data) across different virtual-browsers, which enables privacy across the web. Imagine using a different browser for each of Facebook, and Google, and Amazon, and whatever different kinds of sites you might be using. Facebook or Google won't know what other websites you're using, and you can open sketchy websites without worrying about being tracked across the web (if you use temporary containers). With such a great premise, I immediately jumped on board to use containers, and did so for a few months. But then I found out that all it takes is for one little mistake or accident where I open the wrong site in a container to "pollute" the container and render it nearly useless.

* accidentally open site in wrong container - game over, it is now 'polluted'
* no way to clear data from only one container, or from default container
* no way to stop sites opening in 'default' container
* having container specific extensions
