Its Friday, and I'm in a rush to catch a bus to go visit my mother for the weekend. I'm frantically opening documents to download for working on during the 3 hour long travel. One of those is on Google Docs. I open the link. Instead, I'm presented with a new prompt that asks me to reset my password. I must have clicked something in a rush somewhere - this must be one of those "confirm its you and enter the password again" prompts. I close the tab, open the document link again, but no - its the same prompt. 

I don't understand what is happening for a while. Why is Google suddenly asking me to reset my password? Was there an intrusion or a hacking attemp? Is there some security policy that I didn't know about that mandates resetting passwords after some X amount of time? Did the work IT admin trigger some password reset policy? But there was no information on _why_ I was being presented with this prompt at all. And I was in a rush to catch a bus. I could have been in a rush in a meeting, in a classroom, or submitting for some deadline. This is inconvenient for us, true, but more than that it is adversarial because it does not concern itself or care about the users being in 'non-laboratory' setting at all. Let me explain.

Same issue for terms and conditions - we have updated, but what is the update? I don't remember the last terms and conditions - how am I going to understand what has changed?
