description: Setting up Virtuoso as a triple-store and serving with Nginx
headerimage: 
===
<p><a href="https://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/linked-data/">Openlink Virtuoso</a> is a powerful
triple-store (and also a traditional RDBMS) with many different features. Setting
up virtuoso is easy as packages are available in most distributions. Virtuoso has
a bizzare collection of documentation which is scattered, unorganised, and sometimes
missing. Depite this, it is a solid tool which is easy to set up and use, and comes
configured ready for production use.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The package <code>virtuoso-opensource</code> is available on Debian based systems, and can be
installed with -</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get install virtuoso-opensource</code></pre>


<p>which will install virtuoso and set it up as a system service with the name</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>virtuoso-opensource-X.x</code></pre>


<p>with <code>X.x</code> being version numbers, which for me were <code>6.1</code>.
The service can be managed as:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-bash"># start, stop, restart, status
sudo service virtuoso-opensource-X.x start
sudo service virtuoso-opensource-X.x stop
sudo service virtuoso-opensource-X.x restart
sudo service virtuoso-opensource-X.x status</code></pre>


<p>During installation, virtuoso will ask to set a password for two users -
<code>DBA</code> and <code>DAV</code> which are like <code>admins</code> for the web interface and management actions.
It is essential to remember the password as this is required to make changes to
virtuoso and also to add other users.</p>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>The config file is located at -</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>/etc/virtuoso-opensource-X.x/virtuoso.ini</code></pre>


<p>and contains settings for storage location and server settings. Virtuoso has the option
of serving the management interface over a SSL certificate (located in the <em>Parameters</em>
section) which is commented out by default. The configuration for the Web interface is
in the <code>HTTPServer</code> section.</p>
<p><code>ServerPort</code> refers to the port the virtuoso interface runs at, which is <code>8890</code> by default,
which can be changed through this option. A description of the various options is
available at <a href="http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/dbadm/">link</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conductor">Conductor</h2>
<p>The virtuoso web interface is called conductor, and offers management capabilities
for all its features. It is served by default at <code>/conductor</code> URL prefixed
by wherever virtuoso is being served.</p>
<h3 id="linked-data">Linked Data</h3>
<p>The <em>linked data</em> section in <em>Conductor</em> offers a <em>SPARQL</em> endpoint, query interface,
and management capabilities for graphs and datasets. The default tab for <em>SPARQL</em>
is a query interface which queries the (<em>default</em>) graph specified and displays
the results in the page itself. <em>Graphs</em> shows all available graphs in the triple store,
and virtuoso comes with a lot of RDF data and some graphs by default, which one can
assume are required for its configurations and data settings. The <em>Namespaces</em> tab
shows the stored namespaces for RDF graphs, and one can add custom namespaces here.
<em>Quad Store Upload</em> provides a simple way to upload a RDF file as a dataset or import
it from a URL. It requires the <em>named graph IRI</em> under which the dataset is stored in the
triple store. There is no <em>default</em> graph, therefore the namespace <em>has</em> to be provided.</p>
<h2 id="isql">iSQL</h2>
<p>Virtuoso provides a utility called <em>Interactive SQL</em> or <em>iSQL</em> which is accessed
using <code>isql-vt</code> or can be symlinked from <code>/usr/bin/isql-vt</code>. This utility provides
SQL-like access to the datasets which can be used to perform SPARQL queries or
upload data into the triple store.</p>
<h2 id="sparql-endpoint">SPARQL Endpoint</h2>
<p>By default, <code>/sparql</code> is the <em>SPARQL</em> endpoint provided by virtuoso, and requires no
access control to set up or access. So once you have used <em>Conductor</em> or <em>iSQL</em> to upload
the dataset, the <em>SPARQL</em> endpoint is ready to serve the data for the given graph IRI.
The only thing to configure is to serve datasets under a given IRI.</p>
<h2 id="exposing-virtuoso-interfaces-using-nginx">Exposing Virtuoso interfaces using Nginx</h2>
<p>By default, Virtuoso runs at <code>localhost:8890</code>, which Nginx can be configured with a
proxy to pass traffic to the server. However, for some reason, Nginx cannot pass
in a reverse proxy, or map URL to the localhost as required. A <em>hack</em> around this
is to configure all the locations virtuoso requires as URL accesses, and proxy pass
them to the Virtuoso server. A list of them is-</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-bash">/virtuoso

/ontology
/page
/property
/rdfdesc
/resource

/wikicompany</code></pre>


<p>If a particular service is to be restricted or not provided, then simply remove
its URL from the Nginx configurations. An example of a proxy configuration for
a URL is -</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-nginx">location /sparql {
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr ;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr ;
    proxy_set_header Host $host ;
    proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;
    rewrite ^/virtuoso/?(.*) /$1 break;
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8890/;
    proxy_redirect off;</code></pre>
