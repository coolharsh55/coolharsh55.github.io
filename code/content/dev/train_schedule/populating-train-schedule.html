<p>Once the <strong>Station</strong> list has been fed into the database, along with the
associated properties (next and previous), the <strong>Trains</strong> can be added to the database as
well. The <strong>Timing</strong> objects
for each station can be created automatically once a train has been
added. The concept of up/down as
directions amongst trains is a trivial, but useful one.</p>
<p>While adding the train, it's
timing, train_no, initial station and destination will be the inputs.
The ID will be assigned automatically by the system since we have no
need to set it explicitly.</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>post_save for Train:
  if train.initial_station.id &gt; train.destination.id:
  # direction is UP lonavala to pune
    add_up_train(train)
  else:
  # direction is DOWN: pune to lonavala
    add_down_train(train)

  add_up_train:
    station_list = [
      stations where 
      id&lt;=train.initial_station.id 
      and id&gt;=train.destination ]
    ( order in descending order )
    time = train.time 
    # start time
    for station in station_list:
      timing.train = train
      timing.station = station
      timing.time = time
     time = time + station.time_to_next

  add_down_train:
    station_list = [ 
      stations where id&lt;=train.destination
      and id&gt;=train.initial_station ]
      ( order in ascending order )
      time = train.time # start time
      for station in station_list:
        timing = Timing()
        timing.train = train
        timing.station = station
        timing.time = time
        timing.save()
        time = time + station.time_to_prev</code></pre>


<p>This will populate the train
timings based on the train (up/down). It can be further refactored using
abstraction for getting the station list and calculating the time
between stops. For example, lambdas can be used and passed to a generic
add_train function:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>add_train(train):
  if train.initial_station.id &gt; train.destination.id:
  # UP
    top = train.initial_station.id
    bottom = train.destination.id
    ordering = descending
    stop = lambda station: station.time_to_next
  else:
  # DOWN
    top = train.destination.id
    bottom = train.initial_station.id
    ordering = ascending
    stop = lambda station: station.time_to_prev
    station_list = [
      stations where id&lt;=top
      and id&gt;=bottom ]
      ( order by ordering )
    time = train.time
    for station in station_list:
        timing.train = train
        timing.station = station
        timing.time = time
        timing.save()
        time = time + stop(station)</code></pre>


<p>This results in roughly the same
code, but saves duplication where unnecessary. If the train is being
<strong>modified</strong>, then instead of modifying all the timings, it is easier to
delete them all and repopulate the timing table with the new
entries.</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>add_train(train):
  if train in [ 
    select train in timings ]
  ( group by train )
  # train already has timings, so let's remove them first
  delete all timings
    where train=train
  # ... rest of the code remains the same</code></pre>
