<p>These are the working notes for adding location concepts to DPV. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/209">issue#209</a> for tracking this work.</p>
<section id="motivation">
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p><a href="https://w3id.org/dpv">DPV</a>’s core goal at the onset of
    the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/dpvcg/">DPVCG</a> was
    representing information about the processing of personal data. This
    required the creation of <code>StorageLocation</code> as a concept to
    state where data was being stored. Since then, the DPV has expanded
    significantly, and the real-world necessity of expressing and using
    locations has led to creation of several location related concepts.
    These include concepts such as <code>Country</code> and
    <code>City</code> which represent geo-physical locations which act as
    jurisdictions. It also includes a new concept called
    <code>LocationLocality</code> which is further expanded into more
    concepts such as <code>WithinDevice</code> and
    <code>RemoteLocation</code>. In DPV v2.1, the extension <a
    href="https://w3id.org/dpv/loc">LOC</a> was added that provides a large
    taxonomy of countries and regions based on the ISO 3166 standard.</p>
    <p>These concepts reflect the need to represent real/physical locations
    (specific countries and cities) as well as non-real/non-physical
    locations such as within a device. However, a third category of
    locations also exists between the two where <em>subjective labels</em>
    such as <em>home</em> or <em>office</em> are used to indicate physical
    locations that differ for each person, as well as virtual locations such
    as <em>device</em> and <em>app</em> that differ for each context. Going
    ahead, DPV should represent such concepts as these are relevant to
    represent information in a manner that fits the context e.g. where a
    particular device is said to be used at home, or that there is a CCTV
    that is monitoring employees in an office.</p>

    <h2>What exists? A Literature Review</h2>
    <p><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types">Google Places</a> has a taxonomy of location concepts for use with Google Maps. It includes concepts such as <i>cafe</i> and <i>park</i>, but does not specify them as public or private, or categorise them in any other way. The <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/place-types">New Places Type</a> taxonomy has categorisations such as <i>Education</i> and <i>Health and Wellness</i> which have further granular concepts (1 level deep).</p>
    <p><a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features">OpenStreetMap</a> also has a taxonomy of location types which are similarly structured, though with a larger taxonomy. However, there is no indication of places as being public or private.</p>
    <p><a href="https://schema.org">schema.org</a> has some location types, e.g. <a href="https://schema.org/Hotel">Hotel</a>, which are extensions of a common top concept called <a href="https://schema.org/Place">Place</a>. The taxonomy of places is a hierarchy with multiple levels, though the focus is on commercial activities and information such as addresses.</p>
    <p>Sector-based financial classification schemes such as NAICS (e.g. <a href="https://www.naics.com/code-search/?trms=place&v=2022&styp=naics&qid=5f065b327f">search for places</a>) and ISIC (e.g. <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/classifications/Econ/Structure">search for places</a>). However, these are economic activities and only some can be correlated to locations such as restaurants.</p>
    <p>I could not find any taxonomy of virtual locations other than a few concepts that relate to technology-specific concepts such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_API/Storage_quotas_and_eviction_criteria">browser storage (MDN)</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html">iOS File Manager</a>, and <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/">Android data storage</a>.</p>
    <p>Regulations such as ePrivacy Directive has a definition for <i>location data</i>, and mentions <i>data stored in terminal equipment</i> which can be simplified to data stored on/in a device.</p>
</section>
<section id="proposal">
    <h2>Proposal</h2>
    <p>We create and provide a taxonomy of such <em>subjective
    locations</em> which help represent information as it is used and
    understood in the real world, especially that related to privacy. This
    means also representing locations in the sense of whether it is
    personal, private, or public (as suggested in the group) and to
    categorise the subjective locations based on these where possible. The
    challenge here is to have a criteria for what subjective locations are,
    and which ones should be included - as there are potentially infinite
    number of locations which can be created.</p>
    <p>The location concepts should be based on the intended use of DPV’s
    concepts, namely in a legal context to represent information that is
    necessary to represent legal requirements, interpretation, or
    compliance, and to support information that is relevant to the use of
    data and technologies at a personal as well as organisational level.
    Based on this, the above can be expressed as the following three categories:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Locations that are legally relevant categorisations related to privacy e.g. <code>private</code> and <code>public</code></li>
        <li>Locations that are physical and real but are subjectively described for the person or organisation e.g. <code>home</code> and <code>office</code></li>
        <li>Locations that describe virtual places in context of technologies and how they operate with data e.g. <code>device storage</code>, <code>browser storage</code>, <code>within app</code></li>
    </ol>
    <p>To decide which concepts to represent, the first criteria should be the most important - if the legal interpretation requires expression of that category, then it should be defined as a concept in DPV. For example, since the law distinguishes between private and public spaces - these are necessary to be modelled as locations. Similarly, the ePrivacy Directive and some other laws distinguish between user storage - so these must also be represented as a concept. Finally, specific laws are modelled based on the specific locations such as workplaces and hospitals - therefore these should also be modelled. For the other concepts, their involvement must be based on whether they help express commonly used use-cases - such as storage on a device.</p>
    <p>Once a sufficient list of concepts has been identified, they should be organised in a hierarchy such as that the top concepts represent broad locations and the lower parts of the hierarchy represent more specific concepts. For example, <code>Local</code> could be a concept representing storage that is 'local' in a real or virtual sense, with more specific locations as <code>OnDevice</code> and <code>ImmediatePhysicalArea</code>. By themselves, these concepts cannot be said to be private or public as there can be use of them as either. In contrast, <code>Home</code> is <code>Private</code> and <code>Personal</code> by definition.</p>

<section id="location-confidentiality">
    <h2>Locations by Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>The concept <code>LocationsByConfidentiality</code> represents categorisations based on the confidentiality of the location, with three categories as:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><code>PersonalPlace</code> - the space around or defined by an individual which defines their comfort, autonomy, privacy, and other attributes which relate to their 'person'.</li>
        <li><code>PrivatePlace</code> - a place that is controlled privately, or that is not a public space.</li>
        <li><code>PublicPlace</code> - a place which members of the public can access or are permitted to access, whether by right or by express or implied permission, or whether on payment or otherwise.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In these, the definition of public place must be aligned with legal definitions which are broad. The concept also needs to be clarified from <code>PublicSpace</code> which is an open and accessible area to members of the public, and is a subset of <code>PublicPlace</code>. <code>PersonalPlace</code> is a subset of <code>PrivatePlace</code> by definition with the distinction being that private can be for an individual person, a group, or even an organisation, whereas personal is always restricted to the individual.</p>
    <p>To avoid misinterpretation between places marked as public or private, it would be beneficial to prefix the names with <code>Public/Private</code>. For example, <code>PublicPark</code> is unambiguous as a public location as compared to just <code>Park</code>. Even though we may not model <code>Park</code> as a concept (and as a parent to public park), the prefix helps communicate and ensure that the concept is used to indicate public parks.</p>
    <p>In some legal contexts, it is also essential to distinguish between areas within a private place which are publicly accessible - but are governed by the private entity. For example, a hotel lobby is a public place based on the above definition as any member of the public can access it. However, as a building, the hotel is a private place. Therefore, this represents a case where the same place has to be indicated as public and private - making both concepts intersecting rather than disjoint. For data protection laws like GDPR, a CCTV placed within a hotel lobby would count towards monitoring of a publicly accessible area (or public area). To indicate such cases more explicitly, the concept <code>PubliclyAccessiblePrivatePlace</code> should be defined by extending both private and public place concepts.</p>

    <h2>Locations by Existence</h2>
    <p>The concept <code>LocationsByExistence</code> categorises locations based on whether they physically exist (<code>PhysicalLocation</code>) or not (<code>VirtualLocation</code>). Existing concepts such as city and country are kinds of physical locations, whereas within device is a kind of virtual location.</p>
    <p>The concept <code>VirtualLocation</code> is expanded to express virtual locations associated with physical equipments and devices (<code>WithinDevice</code>) and those that are associated with applications and software (<code>WithinApplication</code>).</p>

<section id="location-misc">
    <h2>Locations not considered</h2>
    <p>The below concepts were identified in 'brainstorming' with ChatGPT, but were not considered in the above.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Private locations such as personal office.</li>
        <li>Personal locations such as personal vehicle (as a location?) and personal locker.</li>
        <li>Public virtual locations such as public website and community forum.</li>
        <li>Whether the location is indoor or outdoor.</li>
        <li>Whether the location is commercial, residential, institutional, or recreational.</li>
        <li>Whether the location is used as short-term, long-term, or temporary.</li>
        <li>Public locations such as transportation (train station, bus station), parks (community park, national park).</li>
        <li>Shared locations such as co-operatives and timeshares.</li>
        <li>Public domain locations such as government owned and community owned.</li>
        <li>Locations controlled regarding access such as exclusive access, restricted access, and open access.</li>
        <li>Locations that are monitored (e.g. using CCTV,  but could also be by humans).</li>
        <li>Locations that are regulated e.g. military bases and healthcare facilities.</li>
        <li>The question of how to associate organisation taxonomy with location taxonomy e.g. hospital as an organisation category, and hospital as a location category.</li>
        <li>As above, how to associate personal data category for location with the abstract concept of the location itself. For example, Office as a location concept is different from Office as the personal data for a person.</li>
