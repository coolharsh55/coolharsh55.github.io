<p><a href="http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/pubby/">Pubby</a> is a nifty little tool
that is great for exposing RDF datasets accessed through SPARQL endpoints 
as browsable HTML pages. What this allows is to create a populated web-page for
resources available in SPARQL endpoints. Pubby uses <code>DESCRIBE</code> queries to populate
the HTML page. To see it in action, visit [OPMW](http://opmw.org] example pages with
the <a href="http://www.opmw.org/export/page/resource/WorkflowTemplate/SIMILARWORDS">Similar Words</a>
example showing all RDF links in HTML.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Pubby can be downloaded from the <a href="http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/pubby/download/">download page</a>
or the source can be accessed through the <a href="https://github.com/cygri/pubby">Github project</a>.
Usually, the latest version is advocated to be used, but in this case, I found an
unresolved issue with showing RDF prefixes in the generated documents. There was
a proposed solution on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25869241/pubby-displays-question-marks-instead-of-the-actual-namespaces">StackOverflow</a> with two answers that
propose <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/25869703">adding prefixes to the config file</a> and
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/27406059">setting the prefixes as URI</a> both of which
<em>did not work</em> in my case. Therefore, downgraded from version 0.3.3 to version
0.3.2. And important change in these two versions is that pubby changed the configuration
file format from N3 to Turtle. However, they both still look fairly similar, so there
is not much of a change in terms of reading and configuration.</p>
<p>To get pubby, use <code>curl</code> and unzip the contents like -</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-bash"># wget -O pubby.zip http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/pubby/download/pubby-0.3.3.zip
curl -o pubby.zip http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/pubby/download/pubby-0.3.3.zip
# use unzip or jar -xf
jar -xf pubby.zip</code></pre>


<h2 id="serving-with-jetty">Serving with Jetty</h2>
<p>Pubby can be served using Tomcat or Jetty, or any other mechanism of serving web containers.
It does not come with a <code>WAR</code> file, but contains a <code>WEB-INF</code> folder which is
ready to served. If pubby is to be served as the <em>root</em> which means it is
directly accessible from wherever jetty is running, such as <code>localhost:8080</code>,
then the <code>webapps</code> folder must contain the pubby contents as <code>root</code> (folder name).
Otherwise, jetty can be configured to run pubby as a servelet at the desired url.</p>
<p>Jetty is available for download as a package, in which case, it is installed
as a service, or one can download the portable application and set it up.
In this case, jetty can be setup as a service using the file
<code>/etc/systemd/system/pubby.service</code> as -</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>[Unit]
Description=Pubby server using Jetty
After=network.target

[Service]
User=&lt; user &gt;
Group=&lt; dev &gt;
WorkingDirectory=&lt; folder containing jetty &gt;
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar start.jar

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target</code></pre>


<h3 id="serving-using-nginx">Serving using Nginx</h3>
<p>Once jetty is running the pubby servelet, Nginx can be configured to serve this using
a proxy service as -</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-nginx">location /&lt;DESIRED URL/ {
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr ;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr ;
    proxy_set_header Host $host ;
    proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;
    rewrite ^/&lt;DESIRED NAMESPACE SET IN PUBBY CONFIG&gt;/?(.*) /$1 break;
    proxy_pass http://&lt;JETTY ADDRESS&gt;/;
    proxy_redirect off;
}</code></pre>


<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>The pubby config file is located in the <code>WEB-INF</code> folder and is named either
<code>config.n3</code> for N3 or <code>config.ttl</code> for Turtle, depending on the version of
pubby being used.</p>
<h3 id="prefixes">Prefixes</h3>
<p>The starting prefixes define the prefix seen in the HTML page output,
along with those used on the page.</p>
<h3 id="server-configuration-section">Server configuration section</h3>
<p>This is the section marked as an instance of <code>conf:Configuration</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>projectName</em> - this is the name of project displayed on the page</li>
<li><em>projectHomepage</em> - this is the URI for the project homepage</li>
<li><em>usePrefixesFrom</em> - this defines the location where the prefixes are loaded
from, a value of <code>&lt;&gt;</code> indicates the config file, or this can contain a URI from
which the prefixes will be loaded</li>
<li><em>indexResource</em> - this is the URI of the resource that will be displayed
when the 'homepage' of pubby is displayed; or to put it in another way, this is
the resource that will be displayed on the landing page</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dataset-configuration-section">Dataset configuration section</h3>
<p>This is an section in the <em>Server configuration</em> section, defined as annotations
of <code>conf:dataset</code> property.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>sparqlEndpoint</em> - this is the <em>SPARQL</em> endpoint URL from which resources will
be loaded</li>
<li><em>datasetBase</em> - this is the common URI prefix, similar to the <code>@prefix</code> used in
SPARQL queries</li>
</ul>
