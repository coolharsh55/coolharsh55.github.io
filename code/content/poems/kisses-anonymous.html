===
<p>I came home, half asleep, and still confused;<br/>
Walked in with my shoes, manners excused.<br/>
My eyelids meeting, glued shut at last;<br/>
I went in to a haze, blurs coming in fast.<br/>
Morning came in too early and too bright;<br/>
Daggers piercing my body that were light.<br/>
My body grew in a dull filling ache;<br/>
Head throbbing, I dared not shake.<br/>
The memories were amnesia, the symptoms synonymous;<br/>
I had lipstick marks on my right cheek, a kiss anonymous.</p>
