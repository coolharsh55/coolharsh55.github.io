<p>by the moon I strolled lost in some thoughts&hellip;<br/>
wondering the strange fight you and I fought!!!<br/>
I kept teasing you over, and over again till the ends.<br/>
And you teased me too, till we ended up as friends!<br/>
That faux mean demeanor,<br/>
The dramatic gestures to go.<br/>
And still we talked, laughed,<br/>
Silly, but did we both know!<br/>
The mist rising from our breaths,<br/>
Hid our blushing curious smiles,<br/>
It was awkward, strange and nice,<br/>
We never realized how time flies!<br/>
And as we said our goodbyes,<br/>
I looked up and saw the moon.<br/>
And realized, the strange fight,<br/>
Was actually a pleasant boon : )</p>
