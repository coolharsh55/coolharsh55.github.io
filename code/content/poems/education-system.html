<p>ah, our great education system,<br/>
like a hollow useless beating drum.<br/>
so tall the claims they make,<br/>
only few know how good they fake.<br/>
making the kids face hardships and toil,<br/>
breaking heads while making the blood boil.<br/>
what to do? how to do?<br/>
shall we try then magic or voodoo?<br/>
even then thats shall be of no victory,<br/>
the ministry is a corrupt factory.<br/>
we have no option but to accept them,<br/>
to walk in the mud and let it stick to the hem.<br/>
cause its our great education system,<br/>
like a hollow useless beating drum.</p>
