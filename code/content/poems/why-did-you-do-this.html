<p>Wafer thin wings floting above me<br/>
Hovering about for a moment free<br/>
Yearning a flower to drink nectar sweet<br/>
Dancing in the air without any feet<br/>
It sees a flower, so swoops down to see<br/>
Discovering you, it comes to tell me<br/>
Yearning to see a flower dat can dance<br/>
Obviously i come, and go into a trance<br/>
Unknown of the thorns it has on itself got<br/>
Dropping a bit of blood, the thorn, oh I forgot!<br/>
Obliterate the wounds, i must fast<br/>
Time flies as i rush home at last<br/>
Hurriedly cover the wound and run away<br/>
Imbicile i was, forgot roads, the mind sways<br/>
Surely the flower was here, but where did it go? ? ?</p>
<p>One question the mind asks time and again,<br/>
It refuses to let go, however large be the pain</p>
<p>Why did the flower hid itself from my way?<br/>
Or did someone take it very very far away?</p>
