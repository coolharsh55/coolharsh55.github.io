<p>No one ever warned me<br/>
About the hazards i face from you<br/>
You could kill me with laughter<br/>
And i woudnt have a clue!</p>
<p>Nothing could have prepared me<br/>
For the sweetness that was you<br/>
A person who could come so close<br/>
Within the past weeks few</p>
<p>With you there&rsquo;s only happiness<br/>
So much, that its maddening me<br/>
There&rsquo;s sadness only when you<br/>
Feel sad, and then i follow thee</p>
<p>Yet, we have so many fights, and<br/>
I dont understand how you bear me<br/>
How you still manage to smile<br/>
Still find something good to see</p>
<p>U love friendships, and u point it out<br/>
Of some nicest people i have ever seen<br/>
And yet u dont realise, your my friend too<br/>
Just to have u, how lucky i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>To say i&rsquo;ll be there for you is no joke<br/>
To lend a shoulder a true feat<br/>
To have true friends is wonderfull<br/>
Theres nothing friendship cannot beat</p>
<p>As i always have said, and still say to thee,<br/>
You are an amazing person, you are, Gauri<br/>
Dont change yourself, and remember me<br/>
Laugh, smile a lot and always be free</p>
