<p>what&rsquo;s that blue over the horizon<br/>
a thin line that breaks the streak<br/>
of dark blacks and bright orange<br/>
a rising yellow hue ever so weak<br/>
the birds that will chirp out aloud<br/>
answering with the natures call<br/>
the scurrying about of all beings<br/>
a very good morning to you all</p>
