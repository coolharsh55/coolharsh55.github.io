description: a feeling of exaltation

===
<p>Tired after the journey on train<br/>
When i finally reach my station<br/>
That&rsquo;s when i feel my body relax<br/>
I feel my exaltation</p>
<p>At home when i have my bath<br/>
And i have food which was craven<br/>
I feel my stomach say its prayer<br/>
I feel my exaltation</p>
<p>Before sleep when i pray<br/>
For the life, clothes and ration<br/>
I see the peaceful sleep ahead<br/>
I see my exaltation</p>
<p>In the morning<br/>
As i have my ablution<br/>
I see the start of a new day<br/>
I see my exaltation</p>
<p>As i go to work at office<br/>
The boss gives me a promotion<br/>
Everyone cheers me<br/>
I have my exaltation</p>
<p>I sit in my new sports car<br/>
And start the ignition<br/>
The thrill gets to me<br/>
Drowning me in exaltation</p>
<p>At the weekend we go out<br/>
To have a bit of relaxation<br/>
My soul is refreshed<br/>
And filled with exaltation</p>
<p>As i sit to type this out<br/>
I need no critical acclamation<br/>
But i hope there won&rsquo;t be criticism<br/>
And that shall be true exaltation</p>
