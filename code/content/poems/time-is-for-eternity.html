<p>time is for eternity<br/>
but it does not wait for me<br/>
i have fooled with it<br/>
it makes me pay the fee<br/>
i lay dead, in hope and despair<br/>
that life may do wonders<br/>
and make some repairs<br/>
but i know its useless,<br/>
that my hardships shall be fruitless<br/>
theres no use of me toiling<br/>
of banging my head and bloodboiling<br/>
because time is for eternity<br/>
but it does not wait for me&hellip;</p>
