description: a resolve to keep moving ahead

===
<p>take two steps ahead<br/>
and one step back<br/>
trade in your skills<br/>
be a know it all jack<br/>
stay silent for a moment<br/>
contemplate what you need<br/>
what is that light at the end?<br/>
success or destructive greed?<br/>
what are you waiting for?<br/>
no comet is gonna come by<br/>
start by walking ahead<br/>
look down, not at the sky&hellip;<br/>
remove junk from the closet<br/>
wipe out layers of dust<br/>
time to start sharpening tools<br/>
get rid of all this rust<br/>
you are the master<br/>
of your own fate<br/>
pick up your destiny<br/>
and march ahead<br/>
everyday is a battle won,<br/>
but remember<br/>
the war is not lost yet,<br/>
till you&rsquo;re dead!</p>
