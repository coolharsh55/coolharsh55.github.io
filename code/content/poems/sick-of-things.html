<p style="text-align: center;">everybody enjoys music,<br />
but it makes me sad.<br />
i wish i could do something<br />
and also be glad.<br />
people dont know<br />
what are suffering and pain.<br />
everything for them<br />
is their personal gain.<br />
i wish my friends<br />
would understand though.<br />
but they are a bunch<br />
of a confused few.<br />
life has been on me<br />
a bit cruel<br />
i am waiting to go back<br />
and start a duel&hellip;</p>
