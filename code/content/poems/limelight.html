description: the limelight of a (new) life

===
<p>Staggering first steps into a new world,<br/>
The feet small, with toes that curled;<br/>
Like puffed cotton, soft to the touch,<br/>
Cheeks that flushed as roses much;<br/>
Encouraging glances, within eyesight;<br/>
The centre of a vivid life in limelight.</p>
