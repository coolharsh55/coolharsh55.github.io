===
<p>The distance between me and you,<br/>
Grows larger even as we struggle to pull through.</p>

<p>As I sit in my home, and you in yours,<br/>
And we wonder how we spend our hours,<br/>
We say we are busy but don't know where the time goes,<br/>
Everyday the same routine wearing the same clothes.</p>

<p>The distance between me and you,<br/>
Is longer now than it used to.</p>

<p>The internet is supposed to connect us in these times,<br/>
But we just miss that physical presence sometimes,<br/>
When talking on the phone isn't the same,<br/>
Or texting or videos, no matter what someone may claim.</p>

<p>The distance between me and you,<br/>
Is what it is and we have to make do.</p>

<p>As we struggle to adjust, adapt, overcome,<br/>
While trying to live without being glum,<br/>
We are a little lost in our own heart,<br/>
But let us not forget those who are apart.</p>

<p>The distance between me and you, can be shortened too,<br/>
If you take a step towards me, and I towards you.</p>
