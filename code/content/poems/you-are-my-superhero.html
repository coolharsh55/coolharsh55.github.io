<p>When I&rsquo;ve fallen down,<br/>
Crumbled in a heap&hellip;<br/>
When that last step,<br/>
Took me in too deep&hellip;<br/>
You&rsquo;re there for me,<br/>
To help me with my pain.<br/>
Your hand outstretched,<br/>
Asking me to rise again!<br/>
In times of need,<br/>
When I need a pillar&hellip;<br/>
You&rsquo;re the one I see,<br/>
Strong as granite.<br/>
I&rsquo;m broken down again,<br/>
With nothing inside.<br/>
But you never leave me,<br/>
Picking up my stride.<br/>
You&rsquo;re the messiah,<br/>
The one I look up to.<br/>
You&rsquo;re the angel,<br/>
I have put hope into.<br/>
I live by knowing that,<br/>
You exist in this world&hellip;<br/>
The reason for my hope,<br/>
You&rsquo;re my superhero!!!</p>
