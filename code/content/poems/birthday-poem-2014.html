<p>with moist tears in my eyes<br/>
as I sit and start to write this<br/>
I invariably think of the past,<br/>
having fun, insanity, and bliss<br/>
what are birthdays about?<br/>
I ask myself again today;<br/>
celebrating age and life,<br/>
going towards a future way?<br/>
Its all those memories that count,<br/>
the fact that today you were born.<br/>
there&rsquo;s no point in celebrating alone,<br/>
in which case I&rsquo;d rather just mourn<br/>
what are birthdays really about?<br/>
gifts, cards and parties to boot?<br/>
Calling over everyone, to enjoy,<br/>
a chance to put on the best suit?<br/>
I always think of birthdays,<br/>
that bring people together.<br/>
a bunch that does love you,<br/>
and who are loved in return.<br/>
so this is not really about me<br/>
that my birthdays are all about<br/>
think, what would birthdays be<br/>
without those loving friends???</p>
