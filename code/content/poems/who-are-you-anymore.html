<p>Years ago you set out on a path,<br/>
<p>unaware of where it led<br/>
<p>But walked towards the distant peaks<br/>
<p>Of mountains catching the first rays of sunshine</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you felt good when becoming better<br/>
<p>But you were just blind and unaware<br/>
<p>The hope and promises of tomorrow<br/>
<p>That was the thing that kept you alive</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you stop and make sure you were right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that you are here,<br/>
<p>doesn&#39;t the world look different?<br/>
<p>Darker and bleak,<br/>
<p>are you staring in a mirror?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who do you feel disappointed with? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The world hardly has changed,<br/>
<p>you are more aware of yourself<br/>
<p>The illusions shattered,<br/>
<p>can you start all over again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A part of you has already died,<br/>
<p>another wants to give up.<br/>
<p>Can you accept?<br/>
<p>Can you compromise?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dreams, the ideals,<br/>
<p>they were just false promises.<br/>
<p>What will you find when you look inside?<br/>
<p>Are you the same anymore?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you even know?<br/>
