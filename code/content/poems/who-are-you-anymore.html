<p>Years ago you set out on a path,<br/>
unaware of where it led<br/>
But walked towards the distant peaks<br/>
Of mountains catching the first rays of sunshine</p>

<p>And you felt good when becoming better<br/>
But you were just blind and unaware<br/>
The hope and promises of tomorrow<br/>
That was the thing that kept you alive</p>

<p>Did you stop and make sure you were right?</p>

<p>Now that you are here,<br/>
doesn&#39;t the world look different?<br/>
Darker and bleak,<br/>
are you staring in a mirror?</p>

<p>Who do you feel disappointed with? </p>

<p>The world hardly has changed,<br/>
you are more aware of yourself<br/>
The illusions shattered,<br/>
can you start all over again?</p>

<p>A part of you has already died,<br/>
another wants to give up.<br/>
Can you accept?<br/>
Can you compromise?</p>

<p>The dreams, the ideals,<br/>
they were just false promises.<br/>
What will you find when you look inside?<br/>
Are you the same anymore?</p>

<p>Do you even know?<br/>
