===
<p>lost in the clouds<br/>
fighting against the time<br/>
i walk around the world<br/>
to ease my mind</p>
<p>i watch the earth<br/>
from the dark side of the moon<br/>
i reach everywhere i want<br/>
that too so very soon</p>
<p>coming from far away<br/>
i am the last of my clan<br/>
there&rsquo;s nothing i can&rsquo;t do<br/>
they call me the superman</p>
<p>holding hands down the lake<br/>
i always keep it by my side<br/>
until it is too much for me<br/>
the power of the kryptonite</p>
<p>no trace of fear<br/>
in the power of my hands<br/>
and they keep calling me<br/>
by the name of the superman</p>
<p>tracing destiny through a will<br/>
that&rsquo;s harder than granite<br/>
hurt only in the way<br/>
by the power of the kryptonite</p>
<p>yet i fight them all<br/>
and save the people&rsquo;s minds<br/>
and they all praise me<br/>
and call me the superman</p>
<p>although it hurts me<br/>
deeper from the inside<br/>
i cannot let go of it<br/>
my kryptonite&hellip;</p>
<p>lost in the new world<br/>
buried amongst the sands of time<br/>
the only thing that&rsquo;s mine<br/>
will kill me &ndash; my kryptonite</p>
