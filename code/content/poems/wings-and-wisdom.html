<p>With open wings, I flew across the sky,<br>
With dreams in my heart, the goal nigh;<br>
I soared across the blue expanse ahead,<br>
While the night behind me lay dark and dead;<br></p>
<p>I rode the winds across a thousand miles,<br>
Amongst the surly rains and snow in exile;<br>
At last I came upon a chasm of pure blue,<br>
The water so clear I could see the sky through;<br></p>
<p>I landed at the banks of that great lake,<br>
Whereupon came unto me a slithering snake;<br>
&ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo; he asked of me,<br>
And my silence was proof of the absentee;<br></p>
<p>The snake hissed and lunged toward,<br>
But I simply continued to ignore;<br>
And when he came far too close to me,<br>
I flapped my wings and escaped free;<br></p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me be at peace&rdquo;, I said from above,<br>
Watching a hunter in the guise of a dove;<br>
&ldquo;Come hitherto at once&rdquo; commanded the snake,<br>
&ldquo;I only wish to get what is mine to take&rdquo;;<br></p>
<p>&ldquo;My life is mine, and so are my dreams&rdquo;,<br>
I said as the serpent continued its screams;<br>
&ldquo;Curse be upon you, wretched bird!&rdquo;,<br>
&ldquo;You will repent, you mark my word!&rdquo;;<br></p>
<p>&ldquo;Your threats&rdquo;, I said, &ldquo;are hollow&rdquo;,<br>
&ldquo;For I am in the sky, where you cannot follow.&rdquo;;<br>
At this the snake turned its tale,<br>
As I soared away into the gale;<br>
Upon the sky I flew with open wings,<br>
Leaving fate to do its own things.<br></p>
