<p>We call it the beginning<br/>
Even when it is not<br/>
It raises a smile to the lips<br/>
Finishes the night&rsquo;s drought</p>
<p>The first ray of sunshine<br/>
A bright, golden yellow<br/>
The sun&rsquo;s silent mime<br/>
Making us smile and mellow</p>
<p>The beauty it shows<br/>
Coming out from within the earth<br/>
The pearly dew glows<br/>
The birds chirping has no dearth</p>
<p>The golden yellow cover<br/>
Over the earth is sunshine<br/>
The night is now over<br/>
Awakening the nature chime</p>
<p>The clouds too sing along<br/>
Creating art in the sky<br/>
Our lips singing a song<br/>
We watch as passers-by</p>
<p>The birds leaving their nests<br/>
Flying away in search of food<br/>
There&rsquo;s no soul that rests<br/>
But a fresh and joyous mood</p>
<p>The warmth of the sunshine<br/>
Lifts the fog settled in<br/>
The sun&rsquo;s smiling mime<br/>
Tells us the day has begin</p>
<p>A smiling face looking at the sun<br/>
I hope you can have till the end<br/>
Isn&rsquo;t this a wonderful time<br/>
To miss your friend?</p>
