<p>By chance, I met this girl last night,<br/>
Had conversations that felt just right.<br/>
We talked, we laughed, we smiled.<br/>
We told stories until the other cried.<br/>
Walking together with feelings unconfined,<br/>
Unaware, when our hands were entwined.<br/>
The clouds hid the beauty of the full moon,<br/>
She turned at the door, my heart sang a tune.<br/>
So she said after our warm little hug,<br/>
Why don&rsquo;t you put your feet on my rug&hellip;</p>
