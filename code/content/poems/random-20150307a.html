<p style="text-align: center;">By chance, I met this girl last night,<br />
Had conversations that felt just right.<br />
We talked, we laughed, we smiled.<br />
We told stories until the other cried.<br />
Walking together with feelings unconfined,<br />
Unaware, when our hands were entwined.<br />
The clouds hid the beauty of the full moon,<br />
She turned at the door, my heart sang a tune.<br />
So she said after our warm little hug,<br />
Why don&rsquo;t you put your feet on my rug&hellip;</p>
