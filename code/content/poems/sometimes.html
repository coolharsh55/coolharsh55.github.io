<p>sometimes i sit and compose<br/>
sometimes i simply cannot&hellip;<br/>
sometimes i get up and fight<br/>
sometimes i simply cannot&hellip;</p>
<p>sometimes i laugh to much<br/>
and end up in tears<br/>
sometimes i try to cry<br/>
but my eyes remain dry</p>
<p>sometimes a lie can saw a life<br/>
sometimes a truth can kill you<br/>
sometimes enemies save your life<br/>
sometimes near ones betray you</p>
<p>sometimes friends are everything<br/>
sometimes they pull you down&hellip;<br/>
sometimes hatred turns into love<br/>
sometimes love takes away life&hellip;</p>
<p>sometimes a smile can win hearts<br/>
sometimes it robs everything&hellip;<br/>
sometimes a tear can move you<br/>
sometimes it wets your heart&hellip;</p>
<p>sometimes you wait for something<br/>
and it never comes&hellip;<br/>
sometimes at your merest thoughts<br/>
the thing is yours&hellip;</p>
<p>sometimes the lowliest rise to the top<br/>
sometimes he is pushed there&hellip;<br/>
sometimes the best too looses<br/>
sometimes he is pulled down&hellip;</p>
<p>sometimes mountains appear as plains<br/>
sometimes a valley doesnt seem deep&hellip;<br/>
sometimes a bird looses its wings<br/>
sometimes there&rsquo;s no morning&hellip;</p>
<p>sometimes you have to say something<br/>
but end up tounge-tied&hellip;<br/>
sometimes your ears are open<br/>
and you hear the unsaid&hellip;</p>
<p>sometimes the dead<br/>
speak from their grave&hellip;<br/>
sometimes the alive<br/>
forget their responsibilty&hellip;</p>
<p>sometimes someone needs a friend<br/>
sometimes the friend needs you&hellip;<br/>
sometimes people read and forget<br/>
sometimes they remember, yet nothing&hellip;</p>
<p>some things in life never change&hellip;<br/>
some things in life seem so obvious&hellip;<br/>
except sometimes&hellip;</p>
