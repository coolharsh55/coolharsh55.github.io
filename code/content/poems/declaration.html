<p style="text-align: center;">i&rsquo;ve always known your special for a few,<br />
looks like you&rsquo;ve found an admirer who&rsquo;s new<br />
out of curiosity he asks you<br />
visit someplace with me, shall you?<br />
every breath of his, he breathes for you,<br />
yes, you should say to him,<br />
out you wanna go, with me?<br />
understand that love is my fee..</p>
