<p>you pull me closer<br/>
then push me away<br/>
you say you miss me<br/>
and then walk away<br/>
I can&rsquo;t even figure out<br/>
whether its the truth<br/>
or some bunch of lies<br/>
I can&rsquo;t be this sleuth<br/>
like that fresh start,<br/>
you talk again<br/>
and the day starts<br/>
with the rising sun<br/>
then you go fade away<br/>
into the dusk<br/>
leaving me standing alone<br/>
in the dark<br/>
why is the world<br/>
such a grim place<br/>
I don&rsquo;t know,<br/>
I&rsquo;m too scared to ask<br/>
what if you just say<br/>
you hate me&hellip;<br/>
and finally remove<br/>
that black mask</p>
