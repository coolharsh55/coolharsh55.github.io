<p>The clouds today danced<br/>
Up, above, into the sky<br/>
Everyone joined them<br/>
Even the birds that fly</p>
<p>The air was chilly<br/>
A cold wind that blew<br/>
Everything looked beautifull<br/>
Everything looked new</p>
<p>On these dancing faces<br/>
Fell the first drops of water<br/>
There was a growing joy<br/>
The birds began to chatter</p>
<p>Grabbing hordes of paper<br/>
Running out of our home<br/>
Going to our usual lair<br/>
Where the sun first shone</p>
<p>Running to the hill<br/>
Where a stream will flow<br/>
Water will come swirling down<br/>
Emitting a pearly white glow</p>
<p>Hastily folding pieces of paper<br/>
A race to make it stay afloat<br/>
Amongst us and the countryside<br/>
We make the season&rsquo;s first paperboat</p>
<p>Leaving each one into the water<br/>
We bid a farewell with flare<br/>
We do this cause it makes us happy<br/>
Till there is no more paper to spare</p>
<p>We watch admiringly our work<br/>
While sitting on the soft wet hay<br/>
And over there, that one<br/>
My favourite boat sails away&hellip;</p>
