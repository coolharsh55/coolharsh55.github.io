<p>of lovely kisses and hugs tight<br/>
shall be my dreams of lovely delight.<br/>
i&rsquo;ll dream you all night,<br/>
after switching off the light.<br/>
your so sweet and special tonight,<br/>
i wish i never have a fight.<br/>
sleep well, sleep tight,<br/>
wishin you a dreamy good night&hellip;</p>
