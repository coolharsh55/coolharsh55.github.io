<p>the skies were clear<br/>
the clouds were high<br/>
the breeze was dear<br/>
staying at home nigh<br/>
so I set on outside<br/>
to walk about there<br/>
on roads by the side<br/>
under the suns glare<br/>
I walked with the winds<br/>
while having such fun<br/>
I sang along for a while<br/>
like daffodils in the sun<br/>
and so it came back to me<br/>
what a pleasant day it was!<br/>
I feel happy, even content<br/>
I wonder what was the cause!</p>
