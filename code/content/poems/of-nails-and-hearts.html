description: The pain and agony of having failed a dream
headerimage: 
===
<p>Like every single day I&rsquo;ve lived before,<br>
I saw the the world outside, terrified&hellip;<br>
Paralysed, as if standing on a trap door,<br>
With an aftertaste made up of cyanide.<br></p>
<p>Like glass scattered into broken shards,<br>
My fear kept cutting into my soul&hellip;<br>
Like the tumbling of a house of cards,<br>
I felt this darkness swallow me whole.<br></p>
<p>With a raging swirling lava of hate inside,<br>
I burnt my dreams into ashes grey&hellip;<br>
I gave up before everything I had tried,<br>
The world was just one big ashtray.<br></p>
<p>A puppet without any strings,<br>
All purpose had left my life&hellip;<br>
A bird without any wings,<br>
Misery was just another rife.<br></p>
<p>I could not feel the autumn nor the spring,<br>
I could not hear the birds nor the wind;<br>
I had lusted riches, but couldn&rsquo;t own a thing,<br>
I had become a pauper dreaming to be the king.</p>
