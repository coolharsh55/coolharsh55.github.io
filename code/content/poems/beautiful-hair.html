<p>I was on my way to work,<br/>
And stopped for a hot cup.<br/>
I wanted to go back quick,<br/>
But then I again backed up!</p>
<p>For there was this mane,<br/>
Of beautiful long hair&hellip;<br/>
Luxurious, and shining,<br/>
Moving with the air&hellip;</p>
<p>I was mesmerized, and how!<br/>
All I kept saying was&hellip; wow!<br/>
I couldn&rsquo;t stop staring at it,<br/>
So smitten I was, I admit!</p>
<p>So I plucked some courage to go,<br/>
In my mind all I could do was pray&hellip;<br/>
Then she turned, and looked at me,<br/>
I said, &ldquo;hey dude!&rdquo; and walked away&hellip;</p>
