<p>The sky is bright,<br/>
The earth is pink;<br/>
It may look pretty,<br/>
But it does stink.</p>
<p>People scrambling around,<br/>
A large crowd of posers;<br/>
Acting to please others,<br/>
What a bunch of losers!</p>
<p>We watch from across the table,<br/>
This abhorrent display of vanity;<br/>
We find solace in each other,<br/>
Lost in this crowd we reek of sanity.</p>
<p>Drawn together, not by attraction,<br/>
But repulsion of the things around;<br/>
People whispering to each other,<br/>
Like white lies is their sweet sound.</p>
<p>As we look each other in the eye,<br/>
You smile gaily at me without a lie;<br/>
I shuffle closer to prop on one knee,<br/>
To ask you this in all my sincerity;</p>
<p>For I&rsquo;m not yours, and you&rsquo;re not mine,<br/>
My darling, will you be my Anti-Valentine?</p>
