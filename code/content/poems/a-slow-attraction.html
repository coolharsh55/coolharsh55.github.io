<p>As I sat watching the clouds in the sky<br/>
You came there and sat besides me<br/>
We looked at each other and neither<br/>
And continued our gaze towards the sky<br/>
Hands inching on that grass beneath us<br/>
Towards each other like butterflies in air<br/>
The gentle breeze blowing to lift our hair<br/>
And the birds chirping so sweetly there<br/>
Ah! A rainbow has appeared in the sky<br/>
Suddenly the air has become magical<br/>
It feels like every tiny raindrop falling<br/>
Is a piece of our heart that we aren&rsquo;t sharing.</p>
