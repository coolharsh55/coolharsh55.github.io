<p>Daylight streaming through the glass,<br>
Trees flying past outside in a blur;<br>
The wetness of the morning glass,<br>
A cherished conversation with her.</p>
<p>Words flowed like the open sea,<br>
Waves that rushed to the shores;<br>
The consciousness was set free,<br>
As it floated down the open doors.</p>
<p>Through the past we turned,<br>
Until it pained me in my heart;<br>
The place where we were burned,<br>
Where everything was torn apart.</p>
<p>Memory is frail, memory is weak,<br>
Remembering is not an easy task;<br>
And yet this secret that I keep,<br>
Today I just had to simply ask.</p>
<p>I distinctly remember the entire scene,<br>
The burning torch in your hand seemed cruel;<br>
I distinctly remember the coward I had been,<br>
As I doused myself with the same fuel and fire.</p>
<p>We burned, and burned,<br>
Until the ashes floated away;<br>
We walked, we didn’t turn,<br>
And neither of us would stay.</p>
<p>Yet look at fate and destiny,<br>
We laugh, we smile, together and today;<br>
Instead of being the enemy,<br>
We simply continued without the unsay.</p>
<p>Oh what a cherished joy this has been,<br>
To discover and to share and to yield;<br>
To feel it in the bones and the skin,<br>
That holes in the heart can be healed…</p>
