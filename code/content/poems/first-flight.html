<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Have you ever flown a paper plane right after the rain?<br />
Through the gentle, cool winds that flow and dance in the air?<br />
Watched as the plane danced with the wind?<br />
Seen it pass over rivulets and streams?<br />
Felt sad when its journey ended?</p>

<p>This was part of RISE (random inspired story experience), where I saw the picture, and started writing the first things that came to my mind. I was thinking about a time when I went through all these things about paper planes. I sat down to write a story exploring the adventures of a paper plane as it flew from my hands and over the various things around it. But somehow, by the time I almost finished it, it turned more into a poem rather than a short story.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Flight</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The wind ruffled the neatly folded paper held tightly between on the tips of two fingers.<br />
A jerking motion launched it into the wind and took it high above.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">It danced to the tunes and matched steps to the beats.<br />
It flapped with the birds and sang with the bees.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">It passed over cloth lines, glad to be free of pins.<br />
It passed over rivers, jealous of the swimming fins.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The smiling sun shone on with its warmth, as the passing clouds waved their lucky charms.<br />
The light waves spread all around until they split through the prism of the air.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">It slid on the rainbow, through the mist of a thousand hues.<br />
It turned over and around, till white splashes dotted the blues.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">It rode the wind, like a dazzling white stallion striding the hill.<br />
It hovered midair, like a hummingbird eating its fill.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The journey of a lifetime, seen through the morning light.<br />
The clouds cried into a funeral, until the end of its first flight.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
