<p>The wind ruffled the neatly folded paper,<br/>
held tightly between on the tips of two fingers.<br/>
A jerking motion launched it into the wind and took it high above.<br/>
It danced to the tunes and matched steps to the beats.<br/>
It flapped with the birds and sang with the bees.<br/>
It passed over cloth lines, glad to be free of pins.<br/>
It passed over rivers, jealous of the swimming fins.<br/>
The smiling sun shone on with its warmth,<br/>
as the passing clouds waved their lucky charms.<br/>
The light waves spread all around<br/>
until they split through the prism of the air.<br/>
It slid on the rainbow, through the mist of a thousand hues.<br/>
It turned over and around, till white splashes dotted the blues.<br/>
It rode the wind, like a dazzling white stallion striding the hill.<br/>
It hovered midair, like a hummingbird eating its fill.<br/>
The journey of a lifetime, seen through the morning light.<br/>
The clouds cried into a funeral, until the end of its first flight.<p>

<p>Have you ever flown a paper plane right after the rain?<br/>
Through the gentle, cool winds that flow and dance in the air?<br/>
Watched as the plane danced with the wind?<br/>
Seen it pass over rivulets and streams?<br/>
Felt sad when its journey ended?</p>
<p>This was part of RISE (random inspired story experience), where I saw the picture, and started writing the first things that came to my mind. I was thinking about a time when I went through all these things about paper planes. I sat down to write a story exploring the adventures of a paper plane as it flew from my hands and over the various things around it. But somehow, by the time I almost finished it, it turned more into a poem rather than a short story.</p>
