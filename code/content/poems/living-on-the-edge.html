<p>I stand, here, on the edge<br/>
Of a bottomless chasm<br/>
Of depth unfathomable<br/>
Of darkness unseeable</p>
<p>I stand, here, on the edge<br/>
Facing away from it<br/>
Towards the flourishing<br/>
Landscape of society and life</p>
<p>I stand, but I sway, on the edge<br/>
The momentary tension<br/>
Of gravity pulling me down<br/>
And the loss of consciousness<br/>
As I struggle against myself<br/>
To not let it pull me down</p>
<p>I stand, as I have stood<br/>
Here, on the edge for so long<br/>
I wonder if I can take a step<br/>
Away from it, even if a little<br/>
Enough to not see the depths<br/>
Enough to not live on the edge</p>
