<p>each day for me has become so long,<br/>
life makes dance to every new song.<br/>
i am now tired and sleepy,<br/>
my eyes are sore and weepy,<br/>
i am still caught in an age old mess,<br/>
my chest is heaving full of stress.<br/>
what should i do? should i beg? or cry?<br/>
or there shall be peace only when i die? ?</p>
