<p>Today I woke up from sleep, a gray misty daze<br/>
And I looked in the mirror and saw myself there<br/>
A shadow of the past with an unsteady gaze<br/>
Moving through the day, barely aware.</p>

<p>I wondered what happened to life and love<br/>
Where it all went away, I don't know<br/>
Now I touch everything with care, in a glove<br/>
A good memory seems so long ago</p>

<p>It is bright outside, but it blinds me<br/>
I do not know anymore how to see<br/>
The days and the nights are the same<br/>
Where I fail myself and create the blame</p>

<p>I wish this all were a dream, but I remember the start<br/>
I wish this all was imaginary, but I am stuck in reality<br/>
I wish there was an option to restart,<br/>
But there's no higher power for an enquiry.</p>

<p>At the end I am alone, a single body to the others<br/>
Inside there are a thousand storms raging<br/>
Each one wanting to control and smother<br/>
I grow older and care less everyday, simply aging<br/>
