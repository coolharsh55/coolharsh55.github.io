<p>The reality is a simulation<br/>
There is no me, just a facsimile<br/>
The strings have been cut<br/>
There is no score of dignity</p>
<p><em>What have I become?</em></p>
<p>The mirror lies<br/>
The reflection is untrue<br/>
I am no longer myself<br/>
Things that I cannot undo</p>
<p><em>Where am I now?</em></p>
<p>Unwary eyes all around<br/>
None that look at me<br/>
I&#39;ve been hiding inside<br/>
Waiting to be let free</p>
<p><em>Who is it that controls me?</em></p>
<p>The pain is there, here<br/>
Inside, deeper, it subverts<br/>
I can feel it, Always<br/>
I am so numb it hurts</p>
<p><em>How do I let it go?</em></p>
<p>Every morning is a fresh start<br/>
Waking up into a new existence<br/>
The me from yesterday<br/>
Ashes nourish resistance</p>
<p><em>When will I return?</em></p>
<p>Maybe I am lost, Forever<br/>
Maybe I no longer exist<br/>
Maybe I should forget<br/>
Maybe I should no longer insist</p>
<p><em>Goodbye...</em></p>
