description: a lot of cuts

===
<p>I was late, I was tired,<br>
I was empty in my gut,<br>
A simple meal I desired,<br>
Instead I got finger cut.</p>
<p>'Twas a knife in my hand,<br>
Chopping tomatoes by two,<br>
When it slipped not planned,<br>
Landed on my thumb true.</p>
<p>Careless that I am as me,<br>
I realised not the cut I had,<br>
So when I went to make tea,<br>
The thumb hurt just a tad.</p>
<p>So I saw the drops flowing out,<br>
Blood as red as it ever was,<br>
It was my fault without a doubt,<br>
A band-aid went over the faux pas.</p>
<p>The next time it was bread,<br>
Fresh, in my hand and warm,<br>
Alas my finger again bled,<br>
Droplets flowing in a swarm.</p>
<p>So I put another band-aid on it,<br>
And toasted the cut bread,<br>
It tasted good but hurt as I bit,<br>
The bread was filling red.</p>
<p>The third time dishes I was doing,<br>
Washing them clean with soap,<br>
The soup on the stove brewing,<br>
I began to wipe and mope.</p>
<p>There was a cut on my thumb,<br>
That flamed and burned but didn't bleed,<br>
I had been again been dumb,<br>
Twisted the knife more than I had need.</p>
<p>So out came another band-aid,<br>
And on it went over my finger,<br>
Thankfully it was the dull blade,<br>
Blood on my finger did not linger.</p>
<p>And thus soon enough was covered,<br>
My hand with all these band-aids,<br>
Until I became wise and discovered,<br>
I shouldn't be allowed near blades.</p>
