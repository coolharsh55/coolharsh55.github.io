<p style="text-align: center;">my heart pumps hatred and evil into my blood<br />
the brain is filled with guilt that stinks like dirty mud<br />
who am i, if not a wretched mortal?<br />
glass shatters by smashing a bottle.<br />
isnt it human to commit a mistake?<br />
why for it put my life at stake?<br />
i am being looked upon like a dirty tramp<br />
i was once called friendships champ<br />
times have changed and my friends too<br />
theres no one for me, not even a few<br />
i&rsquo;ll have to face the hardships alone<br />
i&rsquo;ll fail, i&rsquo;ll die gallently like i shone..</p>
