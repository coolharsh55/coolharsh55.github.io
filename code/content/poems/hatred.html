<p>my heart pumps hatred and evil into my blood<br/>
the brain is filled with guilt that stinks like dirty mud<br/>
who am i, if not a wretched mortal?<br/>
glass shatters by smashing a bottle.<br/>
isnt it human to commit a mistake?<br/>
why for it put my life at stake?<br/>
i am being looked upon like a dirty tramp<br/>
i was once called friendships champ<br/>
times have changed and my friends too<br/>
theres no one for me, not even a few<br/>
i&rsquo;ll have to face the hardships alone<br/>
i&rsquo;ll fail, i&rsquo;ll die gallently like i shone..</p>
