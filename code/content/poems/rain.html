<p>Heat bellowed out from the ground<br/>
Coming out in wispy little airy flames<br/>
The children scorned and ran inside<br/>
No more play and no more games<br/>
Their homes werent spared the heat<br/>
As it came about through the tin roof<br/>
Profusely sweating and wiping it off<br/>
Each and everyone stayed aloof<br/>
A curse escaped the lips of mother<br/>
As she ranted away at the sun<br/>
Curse him and this increasing heat<br/>
How could all the work be done?<br/>
As each and everyone sat sweating<br/>
Using wet cloths to wipe it dry<br/>
A young innocent girl ran outside<br/>
To be scolded by mother and to cry<br/>
Everyone rushed outside to the girl<br/>
No one likes to hear a crying children<br/>
The hot winds that were blowing there<br/>
Began to toss and turn and roam wild<br/>
The clouds sensed all this sadness<br/>
As it cried and shed its tears<br/>
The little girl was startled by a drop<br/>
And it dissolved all her fears<br/>
Wiping her face and looking about<br/>
She sensed the changes in the air<br/>
To her innocent mind it was heaven<br/>
As she began dancing with a flair<br/>
The onlookers were first surprised<br/>
Granny patted her blowing grizzle<br/>
And then light drops rushed about<br/>
To meet the earth in a drizzle<br/>
Sweet smell filled the air<br/>
As the heat was slain<br/>
The little girl pointed to heaven<br/>
And simply said &ndash; &ldquo;<strong>RAIN</strong>&ldquo;!</p>
