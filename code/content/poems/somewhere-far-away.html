===
<p>somewhere far away,<br/>
lies the other side of me,<br/>
trapped in a cell, forever,<br/>
not to be free&hellip;</p>
<p>my soul split in half,<br/>
my life destroyed,<br/>
dooming everything,<br/>
except my love&hellip;</p>
<p>so far away from me,<br/>
dont know how she would be,<br/>
i wonder with each day,<br/>
whether she forgot me&hellip;</p>
<p>trapped in a cell, forever,<br/>
not to be free&hellip;<br/>
my soul split in half,<br/>
my life destroyed,<br/>
dooming everything,<br/>
except my love&hellip;</p>
<p>never did she answer,<br/>
any of my calls,<br/>
destiny made doubly sure,<br/>
i remained too far&hellip;</p>
<p>my heart bombed out,<br/>
blood sprayed in glory,<br/>
painting everything red,<br/>
except my love&hellip;</p>
<p>killing everything i see,<br/>
killing everything, including me<br/>
but it woudnt kill the immortal,<br/>
would not kill immortal love,<br/>
except my love&hellip;</p>
