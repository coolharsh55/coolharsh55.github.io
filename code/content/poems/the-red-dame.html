<p>So lovely it would be<br/>
For two friends to fly<br/>
To have long chats end<br/>
And to gossip on the sly</p>
<p>That made me so happy<br/>
Got me to be grinned<br/>
Promising me laughter<br/>
Tickled till i screamed</p>
<p>Even you were so game<br/>
Till you saw her in red<br/>
She was the air hostess<br/>
And then your heart bled</p>
<p>I watched you turn pink<br/>
But never saw the blushing<br/>
I saw your nostrils flared<br/>
Heard you breath gushing</p>
<p>Your face looked molten<br/>
Like a dimly lit candle<br/>
Your knuckles were white<br/>
From gasping the handle</p>
<p>Your eyes looked shiny<br/>
Excited, but still weary<br/>
Your expression just froze<br/>
Man, it was so scary!</p>
<p>You saw her trimmed hair,<br/>
Tied in a pony, so nice<br/>
Her skirt, and long legs<br/>
Not once, but thrice! ! !</p>
<p>You even noticed her shoes<br/>
Short, blunt, fiery fiery red<br/>
Had i lost you? Had i? ? ?<br/>
Did you notice my dread?</p>
<p>I think you did not<br/>
You were still at her<br/>
Not obvious to anyone<br/>
Not even me, brother!</p>
<p>But that went on only till<br/>
I kicked you in the shins<br/>
And pulled out your hair<br/>
Coudn&rsquo;t stop your grins</p>
<p>You woudn&rsquo;t look at me<br/>
I didnt know what to say<br/>
So i called her up closer<br/>
Told her you were gay!</p>
