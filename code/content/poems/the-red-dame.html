<p style="text-align: center;">So lovely it would be<br />
For two friends to fly<br />
To have long chats end<br />
And to gossip on the sly</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">That made me so happy<br />
Got me to be grinned<br />
Promising me laughter<br />
Tickled till i screamed</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Even you were so game<br />
Till you saw her in red<br />
She was the air hostess<br />
And then your heart bled</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I watched you turn pink<br />
But never saw the blushing<br />
I saw your nostrils flared<br />
Heard you breath gushing</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Your face looked molten<br />
Like a dimly lit candle<br />
Your knuckles were white<br />
From gasping the handle</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Your eyes looked shiny<br />
Excited, but still weary<br />
Your expression just froze<br />
Man, it was so scary!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">You saw her trimmed hair,<br />
Tied in a pony, so nice<br />
Her skirt, and long legs<br />
Not once, but thrice! ! !</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">You even noticed her shoes<br />
Short, blunt, fiery fiery red<br />
Had i lost you? Had i? ? ?<br />
Did you notice my dread?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I think you did not<br />
You were still at her<br />
Not obvious to anyone<br />
Not even me, brother!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">But that went on only till<br />
I kicked you in the shins<br />
And pulled out your hair<br />
Coudn&rsquo;t stop your grins</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">You woudn&rsquo;t look at me<br />
I didnt know what to say<br />
So i called her up closer<br />
Told her you were gay!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
