===
<p>When you feel trapped inside<br/>
With no way seen to get out<br/>
When it seems you have failed<br/>
Hit upon by the mightiest clout</p>
<p>When it seems you are loosing<br/>
An inadvertent race against time<br/>
When it seems a long time ago<br/>
You lived a life of beauty sublime</p>
<p>When every dream you dreamnt<br/>
Appears shattered on your face<br/>
When everyone seems mad at you<br/>
You being a big cloud of disgrace</p>
<p>When there is nothing more left<br/>
No justification to give or say<br/>
When there is just one way left<br/>
A path you choose in dismay</p>
<p>When you wished you were dead<br/>
Never to see and live this day<br/>
When all that is left to do is<br/>
To be someone&rsquo;s puppet of clay</p>
<p>Just a question you should ask<br/>
To your own godamned soul<br/>
Didnt you see this day, when<br/>
you worked out your life&rsquo;s role</p>
<p>When you chose your morals<br/>
And swore by them to stand<br/>
And promised that one day<br/>
You&rsquo;d own the sky over the land</p>
<p>And like sudden clouds and thunder<br/>
You&rsquo;ve fallen down as the ugly rain<br/>
Seeing how you fell from above<br/>
You cry about the fall and the pain</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t you be strong when you started<br/>
Couldn&rsquo;t you have a strong inner wall<br/>
Couldn&rsquo;t you stop and see the way ahead<br/>
Couldn&rsquo;t you learn this before the fall</p>
