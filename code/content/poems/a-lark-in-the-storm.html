<p>clouds rushing in,<br/>
the winds blowing high;<br/>
a lark flies away,<br/>
caring for the storm nigh;<br/>
the winds toss and turn her<br/>
time and again;<br/>
but she keeps flying high<br/>
despite her pain;<br/>
i do not know where she has flied away to<br/>
if she has traveled a hundred miles or two;<br/>
but that still image of her fighting the storm<br/>
gives courage and will keep my heart warm.<br/></p>
