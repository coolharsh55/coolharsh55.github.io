<p>thats a girl (a girl)<br/>
the world without her woudnt unfurl<br/>
she&rsquo;s the necessity for a ectasy<br/>
to live full of fantasy<br/>
the beauty of looking in a girls eye<br/>
staring at hair that curls;<br/>
she makes my blissfull heart weep,<br/>
like i am crawling onto a hill thats steep<br/>
she&rsquo;s a girl (a girl)<br/>
without her my world wont unfurl&hellip;</p>
