description: a whimsy cluster of words for the dublin rains

===
<p>round and round, all the way in,<br>
from circles to spirals they begin,<br>
dark and dark, filled to the brim,<br>
rolling across, under, and within;</p>
<p>fast and fast, across the sky,<br>
gone in the blink of the eye,<br>
cold and cold, being so spry,<br>
until it remains no longer dry;</p>
<p>drop and drop, they fall down,<br>
until the sky has a breakdown,<br>
roar and roar, all around,<br>
water everywhere to drown;</p>
<p>tick and tock, goes the clock,<br>
no birds flying above in a flock,<br>
knock and knock, open doors,<br>
people emerge from the stores;</p>
<p>splish and splash, the water sprays,<br>
as the sky parts with sunshine rays,<br>
gaze and gaze, all eyes raise,<br>
as the rainbow lingers and stays;</p>
