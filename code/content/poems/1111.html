<p>It was great learning maths<br />
To see how sums were done<br />
But never in our times<br />
We saw 1+1=elevan</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s impossible you may say<br />
It has been proved in no books<br />
But it occurs elsewhere<br />
In a nation that hangs by tenderhooks</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here colors mix to form festivals<br />
Cleaning the darkness with light<br />
It was joy, happiness and prosperity<br />
Until amongst ourselves we began to fight</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is the best belonging<br />
To be counted amongst the indians<br />
We would have guarded the pride with life<br />
Had it not been for the corrupt politicians</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>They beg, borrow, steal our money<br />
To cheat us in the next elections<br />
This country would have been better<br />
Without these selfish politicians</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re the biggest traitors in history<br />
They run the country and sell it<br />
Amassing wealth seems their only goal<br />
Greed sells the soul, fills the pocket</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The progress of the country<br />
Is maintained by the young<br />
While those who can change lives<br />
Have their morals stench of dung</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the office still has the politicians<br />
And he says how the country Is run<br />
Then of our progress i say<br />
Surely,1+1 must be elevan</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
