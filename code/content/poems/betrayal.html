<p>you&rsquo;ve put me in a pit from where i cannot get out,<br/>
you&rsquo;ve trapped me, and i cannot even shout.<br/>
its dark, dingy and dirt around here,<br/>
my instincts have aroused, shrouding me in fear.<br/>
why are you doing this, i shout and ask you,<br/>
but looks like you give answers very few.<br/>
i am suffocating, caught in a cage, suffering pain.<br/>
i wish you would be a little more evil, and have me slain.<br/>
i dont know who you are, and why your doing this to me,<br/>
you assure me that these are to make me pay some fee&hellip;<br/>
what have i dont, i yell time and again<br/>
you ask me to shutup, threaten to whip me with a cane.<br/>
i am sobbing now, because of these unexpected turns,<br/>
your latest torture has left me with a couple of burns.<br/>
you finally enter through the dark hallway,<br/>
walking firm, but letting your clothes sway&hellip;<br/>
you walk slowly upto me, brandishing the cane,<br/>
it appears to me, you are savouring my pain.<br/>
you finally walk in a ray of light,<br/>
your face gives me a bone-chilling fright&hellip;<br/>
you are no enemy of mine, nor anyone indebted to my crime.<br/>
you are neither a feind, nor a madman,<br/>
you are a rare shell found only in the finest sand&hellip;<br/>
i could never have imagined it would be you,<br/>
even if the world had come to an end.<br/>
you were one of my pillars in life, my partners, my best friend<br/>
awed in shock at your betrayal,<br/>
i beg you to tell me your reasons.<br/>
what mistake had i commited to force you into treason..<br/>
you silently hear me, with no expression on your face.<br/>
i can see now, that i have lost life&rsquo;s race.<br/>
i know that my end is very near,<br/>
death sends me into a shivering fear&hellip;<br/>
suddenly you proclaim in a voice high and dry,<br/>
your time has come, you should die<br/>
i think of all the days together, of freindship<br/>
that soared like a brids feather<br/>
i now look at you and see that i going to die<br/>
in the last moments of my life,<br/>
i put my head down, and silently cry&hellip;</p>
