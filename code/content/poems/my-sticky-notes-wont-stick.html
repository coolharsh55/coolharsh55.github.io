<p>Life is hard, life is tough,<br>
Life is bad, life is rough;<br>
Out of nowhere comes a kick,<br>
My sticky notes won’t stick!</p>
<p>The desk always stays messed up,<br>
Untidy papers and an unwashed cup;<br>
Work feels like a really heavy brick,<br>
My sticky notes won’t stick!</p>
<p>Lunch is stale, or going cold,<br>
Word won’t make my tables hold;<br>
Can’t eat ramen with chopstick,<br>
My sticky notes won’t stick!</p>
<p>Working hours round the clock,<br>
Experiment results still won’t talk;<br>
I just sit there hearing it tick,<br>
My sticky notes won’t stick!</p>
<p>The supervisor meeting is today,<br>
Only thing left is to kneel and pray;<br>
Maybe I should just say I’m sick,<br>
My sticky notes won’t stick!</p>
<p>The wallet is empty,<br>
Account balance is twenty;<br>
Rent is due quick,<br>
My sticky notes won’t stick!</p>
<p>The rains won’t stop falling,<br>
Advisors won’t stop stalling;<br>
There’s no ink in the Bic,<br>
My sticky notes won’t stick!</p>
<p>I’m not a researcher for nothing,<br>
Genius strikes, blood goes pumping;<br>
Like a stamp I give it some licks,<br>
My stick note finally sticks!!!</p>
