<h3>part I</h3>
<p>I dont know what to do&hellip;<br/>
options here so very few<br/>
getting bored like hell on fire&hellip;<br/>
nohing here satisfies my desire<br/>
tired of sitting online the entire day&hellip;<br/>
hoping that someone&rsquo;ll be there to say<br/>
but nothing happens all day long<br/>
at night i sleep<br/>
singing the same old song</p>
<h3>part II</h3>
<p>i now sit and meditate,<br/>
no longer i quiver or hesitate;<br/>
i reflect on the events of today,<br/>
what good or bad i did in dismay;<br/>
the routine gives me a peaceful serenity,<br/>
it takes me close to wisdom and divinity;<br/>
knowledge of living is abundant like the cod,<br/>
this is just a little step towards realising what is god&hellip;</p>
