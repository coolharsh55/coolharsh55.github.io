<div>
<p style="text-align:center">one-day i was sitting indoors<br />
cause mom told not to go out<br />
i think i knew the reason why<br />
the clouds outside would shout</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">while sitting near the window<br />
i noticed the sky to be flared<br />
then the sudden explosion happened<br />
that was enough to be scared</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">i know my brother noticed this<br />
cause he had begun to taunt<br />
and i had nothing inside me<br />
no bravery or courage to flaunt</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">i was really really scared<br />
so much so, i could not move<br />
my brother saw this opportunity<br />
to tell tales of the demon groove</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">he told me of a monster<br />
whose roar was a shrieky voice<br />
when he decided to abduct<br />
the poor child had no choice</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">he told of the thousand hands<br />
that flew from sky to ground<br />
and when they fell on the child<br />
nothing of him could be found</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">i felt my stomach wrench<br />
just from hearing his story<br />
i told him he was bluffing<br />
in all his stupid glory</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">as i went to look outside and<br />
saw the truth in what he said<br />
there was a demon outside<br />
and maybe he wanted me dead</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">faster than my legs could carry me<br />
i ran to hide in the cot&rsquo;s underside<br />
shivering coldly from head to toe<br />
very scared as i was from the inside</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">nothing could have brought me out<br />
except the scolding&rsquo;s of my mother<br />
in an angry march with a loud voice<br />
&lsquo;&rsquo;to finish my food would i bother? ? ? &lsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Unwillingly and with glaring eyes<br />
I finally slid out from below<br />
She saw I was scared to my soul<br />
With fear i must have turned yellow</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Taking me in her arms, in a tight embrace<br />
She asked me what scared me so much<br />
And when i told her of the demon outside<br />
She simply said there&rsquo;s nothing as such!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">And when i dragged her to the window<br />
To show her the bright flashes of light<br />
Maybe she could drive the monster away<br />
And everything again would be allright</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">But to my dismay, she dragged me away<br />
Towards my room, and all my books<br />
She was searching something in urgency<br />
Looking in all the corners, all the nooks</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Finally satisfied with her efforts<br />
She gave me a book weighing a ton<br />
She asked me to search for the demon<br />
Said she wouldn&rsquo;t go till I was done</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">So i searched and searched<br />
All the while the book in my hands<br />
It was the giant encyclopedia<br />
Abnout the seven seas and the lands</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Irritated, she grabbed the book<br />
Just so to turn a thousand pages<br />
And shoved it back towards me<br />
as I expected an article on mages</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">But it was about the clouds<br />
The sky and even the rain<br />
And the demon was right there<br />
Oh! how terrible a pain!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">She tried hard not to laugh<br />
As i showed her the picture<br />
Egging me to just read ahead<br />
She went to make some mixture</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">As i looked, slight glances at first<br />
I also read the words alongside it<br />
There was something written big<br />
So coolI copied it down on a paper bit</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center">I went running to my brother<br />
For he surely woudn&rsquo;t lie<br />
He glanced at it just once,<br />
And said &ndash; &lsquo;&rsquo;THUNDERSKY&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
