<p>There I stood in the early morning bliss<br/>
With the girl of my dreams<br/>
But she let go of my hand<br/>
Said it was only a kiss</p>
<p>Never mind the night we spent before<br/>
Talking till the sky turned mellow<br/>
She walked off as if nothing had happened<br/>
Said it was only a kiss</p>
<p>The jacket we shared in the Dublin cold<br/>
Standing hands clasped together<br/>
Under the lights of the Ha'Penny bridge<br/>
She said it was only a kiss</p>
<p>On this cold cold night<br/>
The warmth we shared felt just right<br/>
Never mind the way I felt<br/>
She said it was only a kiss</p>
<p>I met her at a pub dancing alone<br/>
The way she moved felt divine<br/>
She let me dance with her<br/>
Said it was only a kiss</p>
<p>All the talks we had<br/>
All the things we shared<br/>
They all were nothing real<br/>
Said I was not her thing</p>
<p>The way she looked into my eyes<br/>
I felt that I must have imagined<br/>
They twinkled with joy<br/>
She said it was just a kiss</p>
<p>Maybe I was too drunk to see<br/>
But I remember her hands<br/>
Clasped into mine together<br/>
Still she said it was just a kiss</p>
<p>When she said goodbye<br/>
I didn't want to let go<br/>
I wanted to hug her and take her home<br/>
But she said it was only a kiss</p>
<p>From a happy night<br/>
At the doorsteps of dawn<br/>
Another heartbroken lad<br/>
Alone I walk towards home</p>
