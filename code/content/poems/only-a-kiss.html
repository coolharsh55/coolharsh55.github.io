<h1 id="only-a-kiss">Only a kiss</h1>
<p>Created Monday 06 March 2017</p>
<p>There I stood in the early morning bliss<br>
With the girl of my dreams<br>
But she let go of my hand<br>
Said it was only a kiss</p>
<p>Never mind the night we spent before<br>
Talking till the sky turned mellow<br>
She walked off as if nothing had happened<br>
Said it was only a kiss</p>
<p>The jacket we shared in the Dublin cold<br>
Standing hands clasped together<br>
Under the lights of the Ha'Penny bridge<br>
She said it was only a kiss</p>
<p>On this cold cold night<br>
The warmth we shared felt just right<br>
Never mind the way I felt<br>
She said it was only a kiss</p>
<p>I met her at a pub dancing alone<br>
The way she moved felt divine<br>
She let me dance with her<br>
Said it was only a kiss</p>
<p>All the talks we had<br>
All the things we shared<br>
They all were nothing real<br>
Said I was not her thing</p>
<p>The way she looked into my eyes<br>
I felt that I must have imagined<br>
They twinkled with joy<br>
She said it was just a kiss</p>
<p>Maybe I was too drunk to see<br>
But I remember her hands<br>
Clasped into mine together<br>
Still she said it was just a kiss</p>
<p>When she said goodbye<br>
I didn't want to let go<br>
I wanted to hug her and take her home<br>
But she said it was only a kiss</p>
<p>From a happy night<br>
At the doorsteps of dawn<br>
Another heartbroken lad<br>
Alone I walk towards home</p>
