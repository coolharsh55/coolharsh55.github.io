<p>look into your mind<br/>
dance away into the sun<br/>
face up your fears<br/>
take a start and then run!<br/>
express yourself deeply<br/>
do not get scared or be afraid<br/>
listen, but do not follow<br/>
think, not heed what was said<br/>
you are but one independent life<br/>
one breath, one heartbeat at a time<br/>
its your choice to decide your life<br/>
walk curved paths, or a straight line</p>
