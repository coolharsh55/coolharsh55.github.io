<p>I want to touch the sky,<br/>
Soar about over so high!<br/>
To dream about all I can,<br/>
To be free, with no plan!<br/>
I want to roam the world,<br/>
Walk the globe unfurled!<br/>
Camp out in forest trees,<br/>
Amongst flowers and bees!<br/>
I want to sail the seas,<br/>
In storms and in breeze!<br/>
Watch the fish go by,<br/>
Under a star cast sky!<br/>
I want to live happy and long,<br/>
An unbridled yet beautiful song!<br/>
To live in colors, but not gray,<br/>
The best time to start, is today!</p>
