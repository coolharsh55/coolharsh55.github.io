<p>Blurs; colors mixing and spreading all around me,<br/>
Swirls; birds without wings just trying to be free;<br/>
An identity lost in the silence of chaos,<br/>
Souls coming together in a seance.</p>
<p>This hunger that comes from within,<br/>
I feel it from every pore of my skin;<br/>
When the mind is lost and out of control,<br/>
The body fragile as crumbling charcoal;<br/>
This divine feeling of a leap and flying high,<br/>
The end of life as I wave off a good bye.</p>
<p>Alas, reality kicks in much too soon,<br/>
The harshness bursts my balloon;<br/>
Another escape is what I so desperately need,<br/>
Healing feels much better when I bleed.</p>
<p>I feel the noise drive me mad,<br/>
I feel the soul rot and go bad;<br/>
I&rsquo;ve waited for eons now with time,<br/>
I can hear the ringing of the chime;<br/>
I need the substance that makes me feel divine,<br/>
It is my temple, It is my shrine.</p>
<p>Come, free me from this prison of pain,<br/>
Liberate me from my own brain;<br/>
The world is not worth one breath,<br/>
Come, help me unto my death.</p>
