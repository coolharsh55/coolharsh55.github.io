<p>deep dark is the night<br/>
as i gear up for a fight<br/>
the time is now just as rife<br/>
to get something even with life<br/>
i know i may have to strife<br/>
even if i used a blade or knife<br/>
but at the end shall be light<br/>
i am geared up for a fight<br/>
deep dark is the night</p>
