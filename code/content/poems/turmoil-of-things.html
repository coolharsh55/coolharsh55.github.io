<p>looking beyond the clouds above me,<br/>
i see a constellation made of broken hearts,<br/>
wondering every second,<br/>
if one of them is me&hellip;</p>
<p>i ask you my newfound quesitons<br/>
only to be put into more confusions<br/>
never thought you&rsquo;d do something like thsi&hellip;</p>
<p>yet you scream every night<br/>
of the scars my pain gave you<br/>
of the wounds i never managed to fill&hellip;</p>
<p>you keep telling me,<br/>
and i keep listening to you;<br/>
that whatever i may say,<br/>
i never had the right,<br/>
to break your heart that way&hellip;</p>
<p>i am back in my sleep<br/>
dreaming your face every night<br/>
dreaming of those lovely days,<br/>
we&rsquo;d spent together,<br/>
so close to each other&hellip;</p>
<p>but whenever i think of you,<br/>
i think of me, of what i did&hellip;<br/>
that whatever i had said,<br/>
i never had the right,<br/>
to break your heart that way&hellip;</p>
<p>i tried crawling back into your arms<br/>
to show you my tears, to fall,<br/>
aslepp at your feet&hellip;<br/>
but you&rsquo;d thoguth i&rsquo;d come back<br/>
to hurt you again;<br/>
and you pushed me away&hellip;</p>
<p>you shut the door on my face<br/>
and switched of all the lights<br/>
but i stayed all night at your door<br/>
for you to come and take me inside;<br/>
but you never came&hellip;.</p>
<p>and in those moments of life<br/>
i remembered, of those shameful<br/>
deeds i have done, of the pain<br/>
i gave you, of all the explanations<br/>
i said i had&hellip; i lied&hellip;.</p>
<p>but then whatever you thought,<br/>
that whatever i may still have to say,<br/>
i never (ever) had the right,<br/>
to break your heart that way&hellip;</p>
</p>
<p>i am afraid, from you&hellip;<br/>
from my conscience&hellip; i afraid<br/>
to ask for forgiveness<br/>
because i know deep down inside<br/>
that i may never keep you happy<br/>
never get you to smile&hellip;<br/>
and that i am going,<br/>
somewhere far away from you,<br/>
going far far away&hellip;</p>
</p>
<p>leaving with a truth,<br/>
leaving with words, for you&hellip;<br/>
that whatever i may say,<br/>
i never had the right,<br/>
to hurt you that way&hellip;.</p>
<p>never (ever) had the right,<br/>
to hurt you that way&hellip;<br/>
to break you heart that way&hellip;<br/>
that way&hellip;<br/>
that way&hellip;<br/>
never had the right,<br/>
to break you heart,<br/>
that way&hellip;</p>
