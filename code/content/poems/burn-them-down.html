<p>all these thoughts and emotions<br/>
that trouble and pain in my head<br/>
I&rsquo;m gonna uproot them all now<br/>
I&rsquo;m gonna burn them down!<br/>
all those people who left me alone<br/>
to move over to other things in life<br/>
Gonna forget those memories I have<br/>
I&rsquo;m gonna burn them down!<br/>
Every single memory of us together<br/>
That have become aching thorns<br/>
I will stop them piercing my heart<br/>
I&rsquo;m gonna burn them down!<br/>
And now that I&rsquo;ve finally come over<br/>
Risen from all the ashes spread around<br/>
Trouble has come along again in my life<br/>
I&rsquo;m gonna burn them down!<br/>
Never walk another step ahead<br/>
Never know who has set a trap<br/>
But I&rsquo;m going to find them all<br/>
I&rsquo;m gonna burn them down!<br/>
What have I ever asked in return<br/>
to have lived in such despair<br/>
But I shall hunt every last one<br/>
And I&rsquo;m gonna burn them down!!!</p>
