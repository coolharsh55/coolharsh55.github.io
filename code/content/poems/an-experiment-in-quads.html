<p>a new beginning<br/>
a new day starts<br/>
a new flower blooms</p>
<p>a new beating heart<br/>
a story unfolds<br/>
the sun moves along</p>
<p>a bee hovers over<br/>
the heart beats strong<br/>
the story has a twist</p>
<p>the sun is hidden inside<br/>
the flower will persist<br/>
the heart will abide</p>
<p>the twist unfurls<br/>
the sun shines again<br/>
the flower curls</p>
<p>the heart isn&rsquo;t in pain<br/>
the tale comes to fruit<br/>
the sky turns to dusk</p>
<p>the flower looks cute<br/>
the heart runs brusque<br/>
its the end of the story</p>
<p>night has finally come<br/>
the flower has lived its glory<br/>
the heart is now numb</p>
