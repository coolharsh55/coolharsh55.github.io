<p style="text-align: center;">Some are busy finding answers<br />
some raising questions ahead<br />
some claim&nbsp; to solve mysteries<br />
some search till they are dead&hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">material things are plenty<br />
money overflowing in the banks<br />
still they search for somethingeir<br />
not satisfied with their ranks</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">the poor that starve the street<br />
too busy planning their bread<br />
to think morally about answers<br />
or questions to add their dread</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">and those of us who read and write<br />
never bothering to follow what we say<br />
to claim we are really happy in life<br />
do we really believe we are gay ???</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">money most men find enchanting<br />
others find women to abhor<br />
most often they even kow not<br />
what they want anymore&hellip;.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">love, life, sex, obsession<br />
blood, magic or a religion?<br />
rape, murder, violent crimes<br />
or simply a war with a gun???</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">always following what we believe to be<br />
etchings of those gone beofre us&hellip;<br />
to look, stumble, fall, get up again<br />
what have we achieved in the end thus?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">to the great philosophers that preach<br />
to baffle and confuse what you read<br />
and to those who sincerely believe in it<br />
Hypocrites!!! their own lifes are so dead</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">to unravel lifes mysteries<br />
really death should be a start<br />
or why in you happiest moments<br />
everything starts coming apart</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">or what you make of people<br />
the nation, the world, or your friend<br />
or like great mathematical equations<br />
&lsquo;X&rsquo; shall remain unknown till the end&hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
