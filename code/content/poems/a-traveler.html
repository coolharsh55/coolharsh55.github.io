===
<p>Walking on a journey I realize not,<br/>
Some supplies are all that I&rsquo;ve got.<br/>
Know not how I&rsquo;ve started, only when,<br/>
Somehow to keep going till the end.<br/>
Meet people, few along every mile,<br/>
Some might accompany for a while.<br/>
But eventually by myself I have to go,<br/>
In bright sun, rains or cold snow.<br/>
For life is but one such journey,<br/>
And one is lucky to live it fuller.<br/>
Too caught up in the moment,<br/>
Be free, you are just a traveller.</p>
