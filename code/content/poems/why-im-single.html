description: when people keep asking me why I'm single

===
<p>A lot many mysteries, are kept aside for me to be asked,<br>
Why am I still single? Why haven’t I found a girl?<br>
And to all those questions, I have a simple reply,<br>
If you keep opening the oyster, you won’t have a pearl.</p>
<p>Weird looks, annoyed stances, and peer pressure follow,<br>
As I laugh at my amusing charades, maybe they are witty;<br>
But others still wonder, if they are not those who don’t care,<br>
And I fear they will join each other, and form a committee.</p>
<p>To why I’m single, I do not know.<br>
And if you do, just a sec, “Whoa!”<br>
It’s not a situation worthy of your attention,<br>
So stop mentioning it like it’s a tension.<br>
I’ll be not-single when I want to,<br>
To put a time-frame on it is cuckoo.</p>
<p>The real reason people say is about me,<br>
That I’m too crazy, weird, or different.<br>
I do not know what they mean at that,<br>
Though I have a hint, I must be indifferent.</p>
<p>Or that I suck at relationships,<br>
I dare them to come and try.<br>
If I cannot live with them,<br>
I won’t hang them out to dry.</p>
<p>To why I’m single, I do not know.<br>
Maybe it’s all related to the time flow.<br>
How things happen when they happen,<br>
And nothing can just up it and tap in.<br>
I’ll be not-single when I want to,<br>
So stop lining up the question in a queue.</p>
<p>Maybe I haven’t been paying attention,<br>
Or maybe it is not out of my control.<br>
Who believes or pays attention to people,<br>
They know nothing of love and the soul.</p>
<p>Maybe I should go out there,<br>
And just get engaged to any random girl.<br>
That would shut up people,<br>
If they won’t start talking marriage in a whirl.</p>
<p>To why I’m single, I do not know.<br>
I cannot work on it like a plough.<br>
Such things need a delicate art,<br>
It is after all, a matter of the heart.<br>
I’ll be not-single when I want to,<br>
So stop coercing me to woo.</p>
<p>It is a simple question, with an unanswer.<br>
There is but nothing else left to say.<br>
I’m single because I’m single,<br>
My hair is still black, not grey.</p>
