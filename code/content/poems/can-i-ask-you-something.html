<p>Can i ask you something? ? ?<br/>
Why the grass is green?<br/>
Or why only in evenings,<br/>
A sunset is ever seen? ? ?</p>
<p>Can i ask you something? ? ?<br/>
Of why the sky is blue?<br/>
Or why during the spring,<br/>
Every leaf appears new? ? ?</p>
<p>Can i ask you something? ? ?<br/>
Why the rose is always red?<br/>
Or despite all the troubles,<br/>
All the hope still isn&rsquo;t dead? ? ?</p>
<p>Can i ask you something?<br/>
Why a river has to flow?<br/>
Or why every starry night,<br/>
The moon has a glow? ? ?</p>
<p>Can i ask you something? ? ?<br/>
Why a flower has beaty?<br/>
Or an admirer who plucks<br/>
Feels it is his duty? ? ?</p>
<p>Can i ask you something? ? ?<br/>
Why the wind feels nice?<br/>
Or how a simple breeze,<br/>
Brings with it a suprise? ? ?</p>
<p>Can i ask you something? ? ?<br/>
What are friends made from?<br/>
How in our weakest times,<br/>
They are always strong? ? ?</p>
<p>Can i ask you something? ? ?<br/>
Why are some trees so tall?<br/>
Or how from the sky above<br/>
Do raindrops form and fall? ? ?</p>
<p>Can i ask you something?<br/>
Why is misery still on earth?<br/>
So many people living here<br/>
Is humanity on dearth? ? ?</p>
<p>Can i ask you something? ? ?<br/>
Why music touches our souls?<br/>
Or why cant with effort,<br/>
We reach our own goals? ? ?</p>
<p>Can i ask you something?<br/>
Why a tree gives us shade?<br/>
Or why life takes away,<br/>
Everything it ever made? ? ?</p>
<p>Can i ask you something more too?<br/>
Why you misunderstand so much?<br/>
Cant you ask me what you feel,<br/>
And there&rsquo;d be no trouble as such&hellip;</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you ever bother to ask?<br/>
Why friends are so special for me?<br/>
Or do you always feel i fake it,<br/>
Like you are talking to a tree? ? ?</p>
<p>Can i ask you something again?<br/>
Why can&rsquo;t you believe what i say?<br/>
I am simply being an honest friend,<br/>
Have always been, come what may.</p>
<p>Can i ask you something?<br/>
Why the sky has a brilliant hue?<br/>
Why cant we be true friends?<br/>
Together, Me &ndash; and you? ? ? ? ? ?</p>
