<p>time has stung me now<br/>
making me take a bow;<br/>
i lay sad and angry on my bed<br/>
bleeding like a murderer who fled;<br/>
i slept not for the fear of the dark<br/>
but lay withered like dead tree bark;<br/>
my dreams were nightmares<br/>
of horror and evil fare;<br/>
i know not what to do<br/>
i know not what to do<br/>
darkness is taking me in tow,<br/>
time has stung me now&hellip;</p>
