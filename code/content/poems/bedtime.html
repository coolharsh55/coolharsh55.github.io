===
<p>The dark night feels warm,<br/>
In the comforts of my bed.<br/>
Today has gone by in a swarm,<br/>
Yet I think of dawn in my head.</p>
<p>Like whispering a few words,<br/>
In the heart of dying embers.<br/>
I think not of chirping birds,<br/>
But a busy ants&#39; chambers.</p>
<p>The marching of the feet,<br/>
To the beating of drums.<br/>
Counting the things to do,<br/>
When tomorrow comes.</p>
<p>The night has robbed me,<br/>
I can no longer sleep.<br/>
My thoughts now run free,<br/>
Rivers that cut deep.</p>
<p>The melancholy sound that comes,<br/>
Too late I realize it&#39;s my heart.<br/>
I was too busy beating the drums,<br/>
To see my dreams torn apart.</p>
