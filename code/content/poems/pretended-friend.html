description: Pretended Friend

===
<p style="text-align: center;">A friend whose hopes we cannot satisfy<br />
Is a friend I would rather have as an enemy;<br />
And so I would take a friend to be<br />
Who remains discreet and hostile to me.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">For what difference remains between the two,<br />
One who vies to get his enemy&rsquo;s throne;<br />
And he, who stabs his friend for the sake,<br />
Of writing an epigram on his tombstone.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">What kind of a friend was she,<br />
Who wished me to have a curiosity to hear,<br />
Just because she had something to say.<br />
Were you truly my friend, My dear?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Being so different on everything everytime,<br />
I listened to Metallica, she listened to Britney.<br />
Where minds differ and opinions diverge,<br />
There is scarce a friend in that company.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">MY friend is the one whom I can.<br />
Associate with my choicest thought.<br />
And not someone I remember, who<br />
On every little thing, with me, fought.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I&rsquo;ve known enemies now for many years,<br />
That an open foe may prove to be a curse.<br />
But the friend, of kind, I&rsquo;ve discussed here&hellip;<br />
A Pretended friend, is always worse.</p>
