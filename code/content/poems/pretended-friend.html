<p>A friend whose hopes we cannot satisfy<br/>
Is a friend I would rather have as an enemy;<br/>
And so I would take a friend to be<br/>
Who remains discreet and hostile to me.</p>
<p>For what difference remains between the two,<br/>
One who vies to get his enemy&rsquo;s throne;<br/>
And he, who stabs his friend for the sake,<br/>
Of writing an epigram on his tombstone.</p>
<p>What kind of a friend was she,<br/>
Who wished me to have a curiosity to hear,<br/>
Just because she had something to say.<br/>
Were you truly my friend, My dear?</p>
<p>Being so different on everything everytime,<br/>
I listened to Metallica, she listened to Britney.<br/>
Where minds differ and opinions diverge,<br/>
There is scarce a friend in that company.</p>
<p>MY friend is the one whom I can.<br/>
Associate with my choicest thought.<br/>
And not someone I remember, who<br/>
On every little thing, with me, fought.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known enemies now for many years,<br/>
That an open foe may prove to be a curse.<br/>
But the friend, of kind, I&rsquo;ve discussed here&hellip;<br/>
A Pretended friend, is always worse.</p>
