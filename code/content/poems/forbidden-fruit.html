===
<p>I was in the garden of eden,<br/>
With the love of my life, a maiden.<br/>
Oh, how happy I was to see her,<br/>
To embrace her, hug her, kiss her!</p>
<p>We sat down under a blossoming tree,<br/>
Careless in love, our spirits soared free;<br/>
The forbidden fruit hung over our heads,<br/>
Oh, what naive creatures were we!</p>
<p>Like a serpent slithering unawares,<br/>
The fallen fruit rolled over to our feet;<br/>
Ignorant we ate it without any cares,<br/>
And our souls were filled with conceit.</p>
<p>I saw the heavens part above me,<br/>
The sky opened up in a flare;<br/>
All the other creatures remained carefree,<br/>
Except us, for we became aware.</p>
<p>I uncovered the hidden truth,<br/>
Sins I had committed in my life;<br/>
Judge me, for I am a sinner,<br/>
For I had coveted another man's wife.</p>
<p>And yet, I desperately held on,<br/>
The last vestiges of my dream;<br/>
I chose eternal fire thereupon,<br/>
To hold on to the sins of my love.</p>
<p>Like the proverbial Adam and Eve,<br/>
I was cursed to forever grieve,<br/>
To always dream the lie of a fresh start,<br/>
Oh, how I despise and hate my heart!</p>
