<p>Lost in the line,<br/>
Between dreams and reality...<br/>
Outside all of time,<br/>
Unchained, and free.</p>
<p>The memory of open eyes,<br/>
Unaware of truth and lies;<br/>
When I am my soul,<br/>
Complete, unadulterated, whole.</p>
<p>Reality becomes the sacrificial lamb,<br/>
Fantasies of every kind;<br/>
Just another tourist I am,<br/>
In the the consciousness of my mind.</p>
<p>Let me be in peace in my dreams,<br/>
Where the world has no boundaries and no seams;<br/>
Of consciousness, God, and morality I do not care,<br/>
The world is a better place to live there.</p>
