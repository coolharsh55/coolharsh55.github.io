===
<p style="text-align: center;">so long i have been awake,<br />
so long without any sleep.<br />
my troubles are poisons part-take<br />
they also run deep.<br />
each new day brings a clot in my veins,<br />
which finds its way into my heart.<br />
my bosy fills with exaggerating pain,<br />
someone has shot me a poisoned dart.<br />
all this because the person i love isnt with me<br />
i wish i could leave forever and simply flee<br />
but destiny is walking me on another sharp turn<br />
i am being scathed, being tortured with a searing burn<br />
i dont know when everything ends<br />
i just want to go back home<br />
i am being surrounded by two trusty friends<br />
together by the roadside we roam<br />
at last a ray of hope shines upon me<br />
i now set out for life&rsquo;s newest journey&hellip;</p>
