<p>so long i have been awake,<br/>
so long without any sleep.<br/>
my troubles are poisons part-take<br/>
they also run deep.<br/>
each new day brings a clot in my veins,<br/>
which finds its way into my heart.<br/>
my bosy fills with exaggerating pain,<br/>
someone has shot me a poisoned dart.<br/>
all this because the person i love isnt with me<br/>
i wish i could leave forever and simply flee<br/>
but destiny is walking me on another sharp turn<br/>
i am being scathed, being tortured with a searing burn<br/>
i dont know when everything ends<br/>
i just want to go back home<br/>
i am being surrounded by two trusty friends<br/>
together by the roadside we roam<br/>
at last a ray of hope shines upon me<br/>
i now set out for life&rsquo;s newest journey&hellip;</p>
