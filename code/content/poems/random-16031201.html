===
<p>I wish words were as valuable as gold,<br>
For silence to truly become the untold;<br>
I wish emotions were as clear as the sky,<br>
Minds and souls bound, not one wry;<br></p>
<p>I wish the currency today was love,<br>
Everyone strives to be happy thereof;<br>
I wish time was as luxurious as air,<br>
No one can leave it, no one can share;<br></p>
<p>A great many wishes I have in my dream,<br>
Raging into a current, a passive stream;<br>
But it matters nigh when I&rsquo;m awake,<br>
For as long as I ignore this heartache.<br></p>
