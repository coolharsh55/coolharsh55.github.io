description: a birthday gift for Su

===
<p>It all began with a phone call<br/>
When she called my friend<br/>
Fawaz Nassar &ndash; the tall</p>
<p>I changed my voice before talking to her<br/>
But it was quite some time<br/>
To see i wasn&rsquo;t the one she was after</p>
<p>A funny and surprised yell<br/>
Who was i? ? ?<br/>
She asked me to tell</p>
<p>I said to her about me<br/>
I was her friend&rsquo;s friend<br/>
I didn&rsquo;t dream she would be my dee</p>
<p>A nonchalant question to state<br/>
Would you be my brother?<br/>
To answer i did not hesitate</p>
<p>Of course, i could be<br/>
If she wasn&rsquo;t serious<br/>
She woudn&rsquo;t remain my dee</p>
<p>But two days you sent me it<br/>
The rakhi that i tied to my heart<br/>
The smile on my face that was lit</p>
<p>Soon after that were flowing<br/>
With the paper of emotions<br/>
The happy wind in my face blowing</p>
<p>Life coudn&rsquo;t be better<br/>
Everyday stop our postman<br/>
Hey, where&rsquo;s my letter?</p>
<p>Then came the book<br/>
Beautifull as they were<br/>
Letters in every nook</p>
<p>Of course we coudn&rsquo;t write again<br/>
Its great though that we started<br/>
To leave it midway was a pain</p>
<p>The first time we met<br/>
In your college, as visitors<br/>
The smile on your face was great</p>
<p>The motions of your hand over mine<br/>
The rakhi that you tied on my wrist<br/>
The realation that felt divine</p>
<p>The subsequent talks and meetings<br/>
Those impromtu moments of time<br/>
Like joy in life with a greeting</p>
<p>Another gem in my life added<br/>
A rare one at that<br/>
Its now become friend-studded</p>
<p>I credit you, fully for other flowers<br/>
I dont know what to say<br/>
She keeps me smiling for hours</p>
<p>Oh, i promise to be there for you<br/>
And i mean what i say<br/>
Friends do these things few</p>
<p>I also say that i care<br/>
It probably means more<br/>
I trust you to share</p>
<p>Stupid poems cant be continued forever<br/>
Even infinity has a limit<br/>
Your dear brother &ndash; for ever</p>
