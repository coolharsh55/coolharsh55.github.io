<div>
<p style="text-align: center;">Have you never wondered about this,<br />
How i never wrote for you two?<br />
Or you always stopped yourself,<br />
Thinking it wasn&rsquo;t worth the spew?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">But trust me when i say,<br />
You were my first subjects,<br />
Whom i learned much from,<br />
To realise my own defects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Have you never even seen inside,<br />
How much love i have for you?<br />
When you searched for tears,<br />
But could never find a few?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The times we lived together.<br />
You always like to remember<br />
Those memories are special,<br />
To raise us from a slumber</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Looking back, one thing haunts me,<br />
I wish to say sorry to you both&hellip;<br />
For all the trouble i&rsquo;ve been to you,<br />
In the maddness admist our growth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Amidst friends, i know its stupid<br />
To say this, but i already know,<br />
Forgiveness has been given to me.<br />
Unasked, like the december snow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Don&rsquo;t ever get mad about me,<br />
Cause i never go out of my way.<br />
That&rsquo;s absolutely not true at all,<br />
I&rsquo;d rob the sun on a bright day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">My friend, i&rsquo;d always be by your side,<br />
Even if you cannot see me there.<br />
Just carry on fighting your way out of it,<br />
And we&rsquo;ll meet mid-way in a flare.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">If you loose me, or i loose you,<br />
Lets promise we won&rsquo;t cry,<br />
Remember each other with a smile<br />
Coz even angels deserve to die.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Dont mind an amateur&rsquo;s poem<br />
But see it came from the heart<br />
From the time i met you both<br />
My life had a beautifull start.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
