<p>Eyes closed, I turn my face out to the wind,<br/>
The waves rock my feet, out in the open sea.<br/>
The land to my back, the horizon to the front,<br/>
Moving on, why does my heart not feel free?</p>
<p>To move forward, my heart flutters like a lamb,<br/>
What is holding me back, chains that I cannot see?<br/>
Even when I’ve gone away and come so far ahead,<br/>
Why do I feel I have been left behind, an absentee?</p>
<p>The clouds rush over my head<br/>
They flutter and wave to me<br/>
I know not what they try to say<br/>
To come with them, they plea</p>
<p>Why does my heart feel empty instead of full?<br/>
Does it not want me to go on this adventure?<br/>
Why can’t I enjoy the view when it is so beautiful?<br/>
Does the sadness ruin it, makes it obscure?</p>
<p>Possessions, treasure, money, and wealth<br/>
All I have brought with me, safe by my side.<br/>
And I have good food, and excellent health.<br/>
What do I fear losing then? I cannot decide.</p>
<p>The entire journey I yearned, but found little peace, <br/>
I had trouble sleeping, and some sleepless nights.<br/>
I walked in the night air, amidst the calm open sea,<br/>
Though I tried, the calmness would not get in me.</p>
<p>When I reached the port, I saw some flying geese,<br/>
How they kept together, in celebrations and in fights.<br/>
I saw the people who had come to receive dear ones,<br/>
I saw their eyes shine in joy with blessed little lights.</p>
<p>How I wished to see those lights shine for me,<br/>
To be the one who draws in such company!<br/>
To talk with such joy, as to make my heart free.<br/>
To ask where they’re going, and accompany.</p>
<p>This reminded me of companions back home.<br/>
Friends, yes, that was the answer to this mystery.<br/>
I could not turn and go back, but write a tome.<br/>
On how much I loved and missed them, a history.</p>
<p>I said thus to the passing songbirds,<br/>
“Keep me in your hearts if you will,<br/>
For I will cetainly come back one day.<br/>
I love you and us, together and apart.<br/>
Let us be this way, come what may"<p>
