description: listening to my inner self

===
<p>Oh look at the sky, the dark clouds rolling over the horizon,</p>
<p>Feel the cold wind on your skin, the sun and the euphoria ;</p>
<p>Don't worry now, don't think or speak, just dream in silence,</p>
<p>Let the waves roll over, stuck between bliss and nausea...</p>
<br/>
<p>Listen closely, do you hear the ticking of the clock?</p>
<p>It is the passing of your time, you too should move along ;</p>
<p>Dream you are flying, soaring in the skies like a hawk,</p>
<p>Up in the bluest of skies, stuck between tears and a song...</p>
<br/>
<p>Do you see sun amidst the falling snow?</p>
<p>Don't wake up yet, stay asleep a little longer ;</p>
<p>The nightmare isn't over yet, you know,</p>
<p>You'll need to be even more stronger...</p>
<br/>
<p>Gently, walk towards the cliff, there's no need to run,</p>
<p>There's a deep chasm there, full of eternal darkness ;</p>
<p>Don't push yourself off the edge, you're still in the sun,</p>
<p>Soak up the warmth, forget the feeling of being heartless...</p>
<br/>
<p>Don't be afraid of me, keep me inside you,</p>
<p>Let me be the seed of hope in your heart ;</p>
<p>Together we will be stronger to pull through,</p>
<p>And you can wake up, finally able to make a start...</p>
