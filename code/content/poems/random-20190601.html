description: listening to my inner self

<p>Oh look at the sky, the dark clouds rolling over the horizon,<br/>
Feel the cold wind on your skin, the sun and the euphoria ;<br/>
Don't worry now, don't think or speak, just dream in silence,<br/>
Let the waves roll over, stuck between bliss and nausea...</p>
<p>Listen closely, do you hear the ticking of the clock?<br/>
It is the passing of your time, you too should move along ;<br/>
Dream you are flying, soaring in the skies like a hawk,<br/>
Up in the bluest of skies, stuck between tears and a song...</p>
<p>Do you see sun amidst the falling snow?<br/>
Don't wake up yet, stay asleep a little longer ;<br/>
The nightmare isn't over yet, you know,<br/>
You'll need to be even more stronger...</p>
<p>Gently, walk towards the cliff, there's no need to run,<br/>
There's a deep chasm there, full of eternal darkness ;<br/>
Don't push yourself off the edge, you're still in the sun,<br/>
Soak up the warmth, forget the feeling of being heartless...</p>
<p>Don't be afraid of me, keep me inside you,<br/>
Let me be the seed of hope in your heart ;<br/>
Together we will be stronger to pull through,<br/>
And you can wake up, finally able to make a start...</p>
