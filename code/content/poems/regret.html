<p>alone i wait on this road, a road called life,<br/>
i missed my chance to strike, when the time was rife.<br/>
alone i travel on these dusty paths,<br/>
dreaming all things i havent done;<br/>
like playing football and doing maths,<br/>
eating pizzas and exotic bunsl<br/>
alone i walk in the realms of life,<br/>
so long since i had a companion;<br/>
oh god, bless me and send a friend,<br/>
that we may have a joyfull reunion..</p>
<p>(but he is cruel and wont pay any heed<br/>
for he had asked me to be a lotus,<br/>
and i had grown like a weed&hellip;)</p>
