===
<p style="text-align: center;">the stars have vanished without leaving a trail,<br />
the moon is looking ever so frail,<br />
get out of the bed and face the day ahead,<br />
be firm, be stern, and let he laziness be shed<br />
be fresh and eat some cookies sweet<br />
let you smile as your friends greet<br />
they all ask you to hear the birds chirping,<br />
they all wish you the same &ndash; GOOD MORNING</p>
