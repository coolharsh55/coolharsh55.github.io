<p>the stars have vanished without leaving a trail,<br/>
the moon is looking ever so frail,<br/>
get out of the bed and face the day ahead,<br/>
be firm, be stern, and let he laziness be shed<br/>
be fresh and eat some cookies sweet<br/>
let you smile as your friends greet<br/>
they all ask you to hear the birds chirping,<br/>
they all wish you the same &ndash; GOOD MORNING</p>
