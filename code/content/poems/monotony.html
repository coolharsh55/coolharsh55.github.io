<p>A day is when the sun comes up,<br/>
And we are dragged from the bed;<br/>
Strong coffee in the same old cup,<br/>
Some scrambled eggs and bread.<br/>
A quick shower to dress in a hurry,<br/>
It&rsquo;s another day to be stuck in the traffic;<br/>
The forehead draws lines of worry,<br/>
Not realizing the world is photographic.<br/>
And when the day ends its dusk,<br/>
There&rsquo;s barely enough to get back home;<br/>
The mannerisms all turn brusque,<br/>
Everyone wants their own version of rome.<br/>
There&rsquo;s just no time left over from here,<br/>
No time to see a flower come to bloom;<br/>
We want a warm blanket to disappear,<br/>
By now the bed has become the tomb.<br/>
Then one day we just wake up,<br/>
And realize something is missing;<br/>
Drinking from the same old cup,<br/>
There is nothing for the reminiscing.<br/>
Some courageous ones may set out,<br/>
On a path to the pursuit of happiness;<br/>
They give up even before they scout,<br/>
The life is now a shell of emptiness.<br/>
What a tragic life we live, if it&rsquo;s like this,<br/>
For this is not what we are meant to be;<br/>
Every day is like the thrill of a first kiss,<br/>
Because we&rsquo;re happy when we&rsquo;re free.</p>
