<p>If Jesus was a woman ...</p>

<p>Would Mark magdalene, a man, <br/>
still be a accused of being a prostitute?<br/>
Or Mary, a lesbian,<br/>
be stoned to death?</p>

<p>Why must God have a son,<br/>
and not a daughter?<br/>
Would the compassion from her lips<br/>
still touch the hearts of all men?</p>

<p>What if Jesus was a woman, <br/>
and a man, and both, and neither?<br/>
Would that not be the true progeny <br/>
of the one God equal for all?</p>

<p>Would we worship the mother God <br/>
instead of the all father?<br/>
And her religion would ask us to be pious,<br/>
with unwavering acceptance and love?</p>
