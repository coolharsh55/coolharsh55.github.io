<p>Various dreams and nightmares<br/>
I&rsquo;ve had throughout my life<br/>
But nothing haunts me more<br/>
Than the girl at midnight</p>
<p>A face so beautifull<br/>
Shining in the moonlight<br/>
Take a step towards her<br/>
And she vanishes from sight</p>
<p>Whether I&rsquo;m at home<br/>
By the window, or the door<br/>
She never fails to appear<br/>
I wish I could see her more&hellip;</p>
<p>So many passions I&rsquo;ve had<br/>
Of love, lust and some fright,<br/>
But nothing ignites me such<br/>
As the Girl at midnight&hellip;</p>
<p>To see her through the fog,<br/>
Glowing like the full moon,<br/>
I run along after her&hellip;<br/>
Hoping to catch her soon</p>
<p>Only to step on a boulder<br/>
To fall down with a cry,<br/>
To see her smile at me<br/>
An expression so wry&hellip;</p>
<p>I ask her for help<br/>
But she runs far&hellip;<br/>
Leaving me, the boulder<br/>
and an horrible scar&hellip;</p>
<p>The next time I see her<br/>
Oh! It&rsquo;s been so late.<br/>
What cruel things do<br/>
When you believe in fate!</p>
<p>I cry out after her<br/>
Beg her for her name<br/>
I want to end this thing<br/>
Or I would go insane&hellip;</p>
<p>She inches closer, towards me<br/>
Or am I dreaming???<br/>
The brush of her lips over mine;<br/>
And my heart was reaming&hellip;.</p>
<p>By the time I opened my eyes<br/>
She had been long gone<br/>
I could do nothing now<br/>
Execpt write this song&hellip;</p>
