===
<p>i sit with my face towards the heavens<br/>
i sit pondering over my life and the unexpected turns<br/>
the events of today have left me weak<br/>
just thinking of it makes my eyesight go bleak<br/>
the world is disappearing now<br/>
a thick fog unfurls, cloaking everything in it<br/>
it chills my soul,<br/>
it holds all things, nothing to show&hellip;<br/>
i am now filled with pain, its become my second skin,<br/>
forcefully that i have to wear&hellip;<br/>
so long since from life i&rsquo;ve had any gain<br/>
i grow weary, and pop a tear&hellip;<br/>
as water fills my eyes and the emoition overflows,<br/>
a ray of hope shows itlsef, i see it!<br/>
my heart again beats and grows! ! !<br/>
i reach out a hand towards it<br/>
only to stumble and fall on the ground<br/>
i realise it was a trick of the fog<br/>
sickened, i succumb and get a fit&hellip;<br/>
i am in pain now,<br/>
robbed of all happiness,<br/>
my eyes are my water-bearers,<br/>
overflowing with each of my thought,<br/>
with each emotion&hellip;<br/>
i sigh, i cry;<br/>
and shed another tear&hellip;</p>
