<p>The door locks were all broken.<br/>
I slept, but with one eye open.<br/>
He came into the night, unaware.<br/>
Wearing pajamas and cashmere.<br/>
I watched him stumble, and fall.<br/>
The thing rolled away, just a ball.<br/>
I giggled, quietly under the blanket.<br/>
He looked up, hiding it in his pocket.<br/>
Walking near my bed he said it all.<br/>
How I was a sweet and beautiful gal.<br/>
I pretended sleep, but my lips smiled.<br/>
He saw that, and grinned like a child.<br/>
I felt him sit on the edge of the bed.<br/>
Felt his touch, my cheeks flushed red.<br/>
He whispered his pledge into my ears.<br/>
I smiled, then cried a few happy tears.<br/>
Yes, I replied, feeling the coming spring.<br/>
And he put on my finger a diamond ring.</p>
