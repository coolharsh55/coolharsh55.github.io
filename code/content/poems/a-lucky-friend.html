<p>i sit in the breeze and think about you<br/>
how lucky i am to be one amongst the few<br/>
i enjoy your friendship like a peacock in the rain<br/>
for you are there for me whenever i am in pain<br/>
so i say to someone who has taught my heart to spend<br/>
dear friend, may our friendship never end</p>
