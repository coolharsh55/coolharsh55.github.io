===
<p>His hands quivered with the sinned.<br/>
Voices speaking to him in the wind.<br/>
Clinging to his body, a cold sweat.<br/>
His hands holding a naked threat.</p>
<p>Be strong, she whispered into his ears.<br/>
The pain will dull, so will dry these tears.<br/>
Get up, she said holding his hand.<br/>
To walk, you first need to stand.</p>
<p>Live, she said looking into his eyes.<br/>
Accept the pain, but ignore the cries.<br/>
Love me, she wished his heart.<br/>
My death cannot do us apart.</p>
<p>And yet the pain would not go away.<br/>
The thing in his hand did not sway.<br/>
He pierced his heart with the same knife.<br/>
The one with which he had killed his wife.</p>
