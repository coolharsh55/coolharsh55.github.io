<p>Its time to leave,<br/>
I hate that part.<br/>
I keep thinking,<br/>
Can I stay apart?<br/>
I know I can, tell<br/>
This stupid heart,<br/>
It sounds like a bell<br/>
Till I take it apart.<br/>
Its the worst part,<br/>
Of knowing and meeting you,<br/>
To spend happy times,<br/>
Till its time to say goodbye.<br/>
I always want more, and to stay,<br/>
To see every topic right through,<br/>
To go crazy over things, and fly!!!<br/>
But then, If I never went away,<br/>
There&rsquo;ll be no thrill to meet you,<br/>
That sweet, innocent, crazy high!!!</p>
