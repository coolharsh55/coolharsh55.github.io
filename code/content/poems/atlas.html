<p>The light streaked in through the cloud,</p>
<p>The sun shining in all its yellow glory,</p>
<p>Its presence filled everyone with warmth and joy,</p>
<p>But she felt cold inside, and alone in the crowd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her mind wandered, restless and queasy,</p>
<p>Although she stood still in her place,</p>
<p>She was not here, but elsewhere,</p>
<p>Returning to this world was not easy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A warrior who felt past her prime,</p>
<p>She was used to fighting wars and battles,</p>
<p>Though the enemy was sometimes herself,</p>
<p>She won and she also lost every time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yet she continued, for what else there was to do,</p>
<p>To give up never occurred to her,</p>
<p>To give in also meant defeat,</p>
<p>And so she fought, as her strength dwindled by a few.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People passing by paid not attention to her,</p>
<p>They could see nothing there,</p>
<p>Nor did friends and relations understand,</p>
<p>In their own worlds they were.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So she held her labors firm and strong by herself,</p>
<p>Though inside she cried, in pain and in suffering,</p>
<p>Not a sound as silence surrounded her in an aura,</p>
<p>She was Atlas, the weight of her world on her shoulders.</p>
