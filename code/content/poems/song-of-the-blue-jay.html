<p>A stranger on a strange day<br>
The sky was wet and grey<br>
She smiled at me, I said, “hey!”<br>
Wished I had a rose bouquet<br>
For she took my breath away<br>
I felt it play itself in replay<br>
She looked at me like an X-ray<br>
I looked elsewhere straightaway<br>
I wished I used more hair spray<br>
Didn’t care it was just a weekday<br>
I wanted to ask her out to a cafe<br>
Maybe after work on a Friday<br>
To take her to see the ballet<br>
Or the play at the broadway<br>
When we make back our way<br>
Walking in a lonely alleyway<br>
All my feelings to convey<br>
How she led my heart astray<br>
It felt like December in Norway<br>
Or the sahara on first of May<br>
I wonder what she’d think, what she’d say<br>
If she said no, maybe I’d move to Paraguay<br>
But she stopped me at the doorway<br>
And looked in my eyes halfway<br>
I felt my feet rock and sway<br>
A stolen kiss in the romantic archway<br>
The sky parted to shine a ray<br>
It was just Valentine’s Day : )</p>
