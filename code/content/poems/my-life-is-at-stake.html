<p>fooled by destiny i made a mistake,<br/>
i regret, my life is at stake.<br/>
i knew not how much i stood to loose,<br/>
i thought it would be easy, just to choose.<br/>
now whenever i think of you,<br/>
my eyes fill with tears.<br/>
i&rsquo;m afraid of the day i loose you,<br/>
that drowns me in fear.<br/>
you know, i think, i still love you<br/>
i remember everything<br/>
together we&rsquo;ve spent these moments few<br/>
my dreams are only about you<br/>
my nightmares are about losing you<br/>
we were almost like husband and wife,<br/>
why did everything go wrong in life?<br/>
i know it was my fault<br/>
i wish to be struck by a lightning bolt<br/>
i wish to get things back in order<br/>
i&rsquo;m trying to think broader<br/>
i have always loved and still love thee,<br/>
my dear, will you forgive me?</p>
<p>{please dont say no now,<br/>
i cant bear that<br/>
i stand to loose everything<br/>
dont increase that<br/>
i know i have made a mistake<br/>
i regret, my life is at stake}</p>
