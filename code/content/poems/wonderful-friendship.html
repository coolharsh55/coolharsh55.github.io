<p>Of what taste is bitterness, for one with no friends;<br/>
The heart is full of wilderness, alone till the ends;<br/>
Of what taste is joy, but empty and shallow;<br/>
It is but a ploy, that friends make life hallow;</p>
<p>Try opening your heart to one, and you will be set free;<br/>
Or the heart shall be undone, like dead wood on a tree;<br/>
Try a taste of friendship, I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t regret;<br/>
It is quite splendid, it is of equals, no one is in debt;</p>
<p>Look into the eyes, and see them look at you;<br/>
The reflection is a prize, the heart set and true;<br/>
Look inside their soul, look how much they love you;<br/>
Share your mind and your goal, breath in a zeal new;</p>
<p>Let me tell you of me, who wishes and wants more;<br/>
I have but friends three, to the sky they make me soar;<br/>
Let me tell you what I feel, true memories from my heart;<br/>
When happiness is but real, a mesmerising work of art;</p>
<p>The streets do not feel the same, with true friends <br>around;<br/>
One does not wish for empty fame, when souls are bound;<br/>
What adventures are to be had, in the presence of a company;<br/>
One does not ever feel sad, when a caring heart will accompany;</p>
<p>A breath of fresh air, the winds always blow this way;<br/>
All troubles are without care, we wish forever to stay;<br/>
A blissful state of mind, we all do our part;<br/>
Truthful and kind, friends never stay apart;</p>
<p>When mornings are fresh, and the nights are cold;<br/>
When pain goes beyond flesh, the heart grows old;<br/>
A symphony for the soul, music to sparkle all life;<br/>
Friends play a magical role, even in the afterlife;</p>
<p>Of little lights that twinkle, in the dark of the night;<br/>
Of dew in a sprinkle, the fog wrapped around tight;<br/>
To just dip my toes, into the wet grass on ground;<br/>
Watch how time slows, when love is all around.</p>
<p>A thousand sounds, buzzing in the air;<br/>
A few ups and downs, life is never fair;<br/>
But it pleases the heart, to never be alone;<br/>
Never to stay apart, a promise cast in stone;</p>
<p>Of all the stars in the sky, and all fireflies that glow;<br/>
Of all the birds that fly, to all the trees that grow;<br/>
From earth to the horizon, and back into the sea;<br/>
I wish to one day wizen, with friends besides me.</p>
