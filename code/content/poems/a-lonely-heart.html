<p>a lonely heart<br />
doesnt like to beat alone<br />
it requires someone<br />
whether in person or over phone<br />
its pains and sufferings arent few<br />
it has toiled in hardships new<br />
it now lies vacant n hollow<br />
without a single soul left for it to follow<br />
it cries and sheds tears<br />
like a newborn prickled with a thorn<br />
it weeps for dreams it dreamt<br />
many of which are still unborn<br />
seeing such a wounded heart<br />
even the sun may cease to shine<br />
dont be sad if you ever get to know<br />
that heart is MINE</p>
