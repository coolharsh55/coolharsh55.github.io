<p>It was my dream to go<br/>
to the worlds most beautiful place<br/>
to leave all my life aside<br/>
take a break from the hectic race<br/>
and so I reached heaven<br/>
for I do not know a better word<br/>
every sadness I had in me<br/>
was taken away and cured<br/>
I was mesmerized by my eyes<br/>
and words failed to form in my head<br/>
all that was reflected in my mind<br/>
was how beautiful this all was instead<br/>
blue skies over the head<br/>
blue seas beneath the feet<br/>
a thin line drawn where<br/>
the two collide and meet<br/>
a calm that spreads<br/>
when the passing wind blows<br/>
a serene peace comes<br/>
when the warm sun glows<br/>
in the midst of a crowd<br/>
yet so far away,<br/>
alone no distractions today<br/>
no emails, no phones<br/>
just a lazy afternoon<br/>
hop, skip, jump and play<br/>
watch over the sky<br/>
so happy, so calm, so gay!<br/>
it felt like I should never leave<br/>
pack my bags and stay here<br/>
such amazing beauty shone<br/>
in all the things everywhere!!!<br/>
of dolphins and myths many<br/>
enchanted as I became aware<br/>
all I did was watch the sea<br/>
fix my eyes in a trance like stare<br/>
when the seagulls soared above<br/>
it felt like a forgotten call to me<br/>
to join them, fly, out into the sky<br/>
break the shackles, and be free<br/>
and so with a heavy heart<br/>
as I felt a longing pain&hellip;<br/>
when we started to turn back<br/>
the sky cried out in rain!</p>
