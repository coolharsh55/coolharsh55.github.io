<div>He remembered the first time their eyes had locked together.</div>

<div>She had shied away and he had fallen in love with her.</div>

<div>The little game had gone on for weeks, but today he would finally confess his feelings to her.</div>

<div>
<div>He went down on his knee and held the bouquet of red roses in front of her.</div>

<div>&ldquo;<em>Will you be mine forever?</em>&ldquo;</div>

<div>She took two steps back and gasped, covering her mouth with her hands.</div>

<div>&ldquo;<em>I&hellip; I can&rsquo;t!</em>&ldquo;</div>

<div>The hand holding the bouquet fell to the ground.</div>

<div>&ldquo;<em>Why not!</em>&ldquo;</div>

<div>She whirled around and ran screaming</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>&ldquo;<em>Because I&rsquo;m your step-sister</em>&ldquo;</div>
