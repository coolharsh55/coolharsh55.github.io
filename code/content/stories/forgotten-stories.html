<h2 id="the-wielder-of-flame">The Wielder of Flame</h2>
<p>your ancestors had known fire, had fled from fire, had used fire in many ways, but it had always been divine ; until it was your turn to gaze into the fire for the first time with the understanding that you could wield it, control it, <em>use it</em></p>
<h2 id="seaside">Seaside</h2>
<p>a vast world made entirely of water, the very edge of existence, incomprehensible to your mind</p>
<h2 id="a-stranger-calling-you-by-your-name">A Stranger Calling You By Your Name</h2>
<p>strangers from a strange land come saying your name and bearing unknown familiarity, and you know you have the power to ask <em>how</em> and <em>why</em></p>
<h2 id="the-first-one-whom-you-called-a-friend">The First One Whom You Called A Friend</h2>
<p>you had a mate, you had children, you had familiars and family, you had a tribe ; you know others and strangers, you knew those to let pass unharmed and those from whom you should turn away ; you knew the tolerated and the hunted ; you knew allies and foes ; but never before had you needed to find so many words to describe a person who was different from all these and yet you came up with one - a <em>friend</em></p>
<h2 id="grammar">Grammar</h2>
<p>you had used words all your life, learned from your mother, your family, your tribe, and enriched with the passing merchants and travellers ; until one day as you lay awake at night staring at the open sky and realised there was a structure to the way people spoke and that you could use this as a power to make new meanings ; that wielding words made you a god</p>
<h2 id="the-first-religious-heaven">The First Religious Heaven</h2>
<p>worship was practiced everyday by your and those around you ; and you knew intimiately the many faces of your god and its many names ; and when one day you were in a tense battle stance with strangers from another land and thought death and doom was certain - both groups called upon the same god and cemented brotherhood</p>
<h2 id="the-first-religious-hell">The First Religious Hell</h2>
<p>when you walked upon another group calling out the name of your god as a question ; and when they answered with a different name - you killed them all</p>
<h2 id="seasoning">Seasoning</h2>
<p>you hunted for meat ; you farmed for grain ; you fed livestock so one day you could cull it ; and you ate plain ... until one day you added a bit of thyme and your tastes had changed forever</p>
<h2 id="bricks">Bricks</h2>
<p>caves, trees, crevices - all homes of you and your ancestors ; later bits of mud and stone huddled together ; until the day you molded clay on each other in fixed shapes and called it your home</p>
