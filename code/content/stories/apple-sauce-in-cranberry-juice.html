	<h2>The Pub</h2>
	<p><em>&ldquo;Just what the heck is that supposed to be? Are you really going to drink it?&rdquo;</em><br />
	<em>&ldquo;Yes. Have you ever tried it yourself?</em><br />
	<em>&ldquo;No, And I never would! I can imagine the taste&rdquo;</em><br />
	<em>&ldquo;Imagining isn&rsquo;t the same as tasting, you know&hellip;&rdquo;</em><br />
	<em>&ldquo;True, but I know that I don&rsquo;t want to drink it, and that&rsquo;s enough&rdquo;</em><br />
	<em>&ldquo;Ah, Fair enough! Well, here comes my drink!&rdquo;</em><br />
	<em>&ldquo;At least it doesn&rsquo;t look bad&rdquo;</em><br />
	<em>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you try it? My wife says it&rsquo;s the best thing she ever made!&rdquo;</em><br />
	<em>&ldquo;Wh.. What!?&rdquo;</em><br />
	<em>&ldquo;Here&hellip; Go on, have a sip&rdquo;</em><br />
	<em>&ldquo;Wh&hellip; Why?&rdquo;</em><br />
	<em>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll know its awesome&rdquo;</em><br />
	<em>&ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to!&rdquo;</em><br />
	<em>&ldquo;Oh please! Here&rsquo;s a chance to explore something new, and you&rsquo;re just backing out. The worst that could happen is you could die!&rdquo;</em><br />
	<em>&ldquo;Wh&hellip; What! What do you mean die! I don&rsquo;t want to die!&rdquo;</em><br />
	<em>&ldquo;Oh jeez&hellip; Relax. Just try a sip, if you don&rsquo;t like it, return it back.&rdquo;</em><br />
	<em>&ldquo;OH! I got scared for a moment there. Alright, I&rsquo;ll try a sip&rdquo;</em><br />
	<em>&ldquo;Great. Here you go&rdquo;</em></p>

	<p><em>&ldquo;Hi honey&hellip; How did things go at the police station?&rdquo;</em><br />
	<em>&ldquo;It went well. They let me leave after a few questions.&rdquo;</em><br />
	<em>&ldquo;Why did you have to go showing your face around? I thought we were clear on that. No contact&rdquo;</em><br />
	<em>&ldquo;I just&hellip; It felt thrilling to do it in person.&rdquo;</em><br />
	<em>&ldquo;Oh well, as long it doesn&rsquo;t happen a second time. Now what recipe to try next?&rdquo;</em><br />
