# Why do people keep saying 'Study Hard' instead of 'Learn and Apply More'?

I've been hearing 'study hard' ever since I could distinguish these words in my vocabulary. No one bothered to explain what 'hard' meant. We all assumed it meant get more marks. I tried to do that. I didn't *feel* smart other than when looking at the marksheet. You want to be smart? Ask more questions. Figure out answers.
