<p>I love reading. That's an understatement. I think of reading as <em>devouring</em> books (like the joy of eating?). For the past few years, I have been hesitant and outright guilty over buying paperbooks because of all the paper and the trees and the ecology (yes, I'm also giving up meat by reducing how much I eat) and so I had a Kindle (upgraded to Paperwhite recently) which I mostly use to read. I like the Kindle, it is an amazing device. But some books are simply more pleasurable when read in hand, there is something inherently <em>physical</em> about it. And old books, yellowed with age, they are like old wine - very tasteful. I don't fathom why this effect exists, and it is a popular effect, but I surrender to it when I cannot help it. To my great joy, I found that used books on Amazon are actually a great deal, and so one particular evening, I ordered a few of them (from my <a href="https://harshp.com/hobbies/books/">reading list</a>) in hardcover for quite cheap (about 3-4 Euros per book).</p>
