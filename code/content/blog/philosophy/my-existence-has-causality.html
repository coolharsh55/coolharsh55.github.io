# My Existence has a Causal Relationship

Most of us probably live with the feeling that no matter what we do or say we are insignificant.

How I'm one person, but what I think, what I say, what I do has an effect on
the world, no matter how small and how seemingly insignificant. It all adds up
when we take large numbers into account. Law of the herd. Obtaining a PhD taught
me to not undervalue how a small change is of importance in this world.
Because we rely on such small changes to make progress. Like the flow of water,
too small soft on its own to change the rock, but over eons it builds up enough
pressure to actually change things - carve the rock, change the flow of the
river. We are like that river. Some of us show which way to flow, others help
build different kinds of pressures. But all of us will have a change whether
we are aware of it or not. It would be better to be conscious of this change,
and to choose what I would like to change. Quite literally, be the change I
want to see.

The feeling of helplessness, of who cares, nothing will happen - all same from
the PhD. Still, we persevere, we adapt, we innovate, and we something get to
the finish line where we have made a change.
