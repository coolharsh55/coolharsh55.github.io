Action Context
[FYI] at the start of the subject line or first thing in the email
[CFP] at the start of the subject line or first thing in the email
[REQ] Request: at the start of the subject line or first thing in the email

Many of my emails didn't clearly state what I wanted my supervisor to do or the timeline. So he assumed the email was an FYI.

Scheduling and Deadline
If important, in subject line or first thing in the email e.g. by XX
If suggested, mention in email - this is the date by which you'd prefer it done but its not necessary. Ask e.g. can you do this by X?

Prior Context
If the email is a follow up from a previous email or meeting, mention it e.g. this is as discussed in the last meeting regarding doing X

Shortening for Effectiveness
Shorter emails, context/ask up front at the top

Reminders
If emails aren't replied within X days, follow up with the action context at the top, e.g. Hi - are there any updates on this regarding writing X or signing the document (attached here or in previous email)? Or simply - Hi - could you please sign the document regarding X (attached)? For context, please see previous emails.

Delays
Succint reason and propose a date. e.g. I cannot do X by Y date due to Z reasons, and am requesting a delay until DD.
