description: How can someone name a research project PALANTIR?
headerimage: 
===
<p>There&#39;s an EU H2020 project starting soon called <strong>PALANTIR</strong> (Practical Autonomous Cyberhealth for resilient SMEs &amp; Microenterprises) <a href='https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/883335' target='_blank' class='url'>https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/883335</a>. Of all the acronyms they could&#39;ve chosen they went with <em>PALANTIR</em> - which is not only this powerful evil artefact in Lord of the Rings, but is also co-incidentally the name of a powerful evil company in this real world.</p>
<p>Maybe we should only use LotR names for project titles? I&#39;ve come up with some likely proposals based on bullshit topics - but hey look they have cool titles!</p>
