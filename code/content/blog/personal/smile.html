<p> Such a simple, sweet word&hellip; and yet of such importance. A smile is the gesture of happiness, of joy, of approval. It is a facial expression which shows contention. A smile, looks good on anyone&rsquo;s face&hellip;</p>
<p> It is often said that a few things are highly contagious &ndash; a yawn, maybe bunking, and certainly a smile. When we see someone smiling our way, more often than not, we too smile at them. It makes us feel a little lighter, makes us feel a bit happy. And we carry on with that tiny feeling without realising about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We smile more when we are doing something we like. A smile has the power to really affect the things around us. When we smile, it really feels like a great day.</p>
<p>A smile doesn&rsquo;t cost a single paisa. A smile can be given to someone, anyone and everyone. Right from me, to you and to everyone in this room, everyone can give or take a smile. So what stops us from utilizing this great expression?</p>
<p>Maybe someone might call you mad for smiling all day. Tell him to try it for a day. You can always ask him later, &ldquo;How it felt to be mad&rdquo;. A day which goes without smiling is a day wasted. Sounds similar to the laughter statement? It is&hellip; Smiling is the first step towards laughter. You may not laugh all the time, but you can certainly smile.</p>
<p>Smiling relieves some stress. And we all know what stress means, right? At a young age like ours, it is important to keep our mind and bodies alive. By eating right, sleeping right, exercising right and by smiling&hellip; Some smiling a day can keep stress away. And it is true.</p>
<p>When I was told to just come over here and talk for 3minutes, I thought of telling a story. I love telling a story. But over the past week, I thought of talking about something which might be useful, that is if you are paying attention. So I spoke about smiling. Each of us here wants to be happy, wants to be content. Yet not many smile so much. A person who smiles a lot is happy and vice-versa. You start your morning with a smile and you end up with a happy day. You really look forward to doing things. A smile is a great tool to cope up with life.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s all that I am going to talk about. And I hope you got the message. Smile and be happy. Thank you!</p>
