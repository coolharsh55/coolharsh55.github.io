A simple thread to counter Facebook's claims that 
providing ads is the reason users join/use the platform.

If ads are what users sign up for, what controls has Facebook given to the users
to control the ads and what controls has Facebook given to the advertisers to
control or enact ads. Specifically about "personalised ads". Has Facebook given 
any inclination for users to personalise their ads e.g. by indicating topics
or control of areas of interest?

Timeline of social network from inception: no ads, some contextual ads, etc.
Recent changes have included 'transparency' of ads.

Argument that providing ads is necessary to provide a service, and hence
becomes part of the contractual necessity to provide a service

What kind of ads are necessary. There has to be a balance between actively
acquiring monetary resources in order to provide a service and protecting
consumers from said effect of monetisation.

The fact that Facebook has either not considered or developed an option for
users to pay money as a source to obtain service is an argument against the
notion that ads are absolutely necessary. A newspaper utilises ads, with free
papers solely supported by donation and ads, as well as papers purchased by
the reader with ads in them.

Facebook's branding / landing page says "Facebook helps you connect and 
share with the people in your life." not that Facebook helps you receive
personalised ads.

Why consequences of CJEU's decision are important with regards to:
1) What kind of protection consumers are offered for contracts to services
that are supported by advertising? Can consumers simply sign away their privacy?
2) What is the basis for GDPR's contractual necessity claim and what conditions
must be met?
3) Impact on website supported by ads - dissolution of consent dialogues as
all can claim contractual necessity for ads.
4)
