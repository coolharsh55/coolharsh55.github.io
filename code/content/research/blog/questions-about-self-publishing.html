description: Questions I have investigating if self-publishing is a good and sustainable model

===
<p>This is a placeholder post for questions I have about self-publishing. I will update these as I form more opinions and gather more knowledge.</p>
<h2>Where to publish?</h2>
<ul>
<li>self website / Github</li>
<li>effort to set up</li>
<li>literacy in technologies</li>
<li>best-practices knowledge?</li>

</ul>
<h2>Cost?</h2>
<ul>
<li>long term archiving and maintainence? </li>
<li>personally, I think public spending + universities should provide platform for open publishing and the university archives can be indexed - but this means non-university staff cannot contribute?</li>
<li>web-archive is only archive, ideally original source should persist</li>

</ul>
<h2>How to verify authenticity of publisher?</h2>
<ul>
<li>how to ensure identity of &#39;owner&#39; (not that current publishers do any of these)</li>
<li>how to ensure article is not &#39;altered&#39; later after &#39;publishing&#39;? - current third-party publishing means control is not with you, so less interest in changing a particular article</li>
<li>maybe have MD5 saved with external &#39;declaration&#39; of publication? (current third-party publishing does not guarentee this either)</li>

</ul>
<h2>Peer-reviewed?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Where to put &#39;notice&#39; of where the article was reviewed? Currently, the proceedings first pages provide some information on process, chairs, etc.</li>
<li>How to prove the published article was peer-reviewed? (current third-party publishing does not guarentee this either, it is all on &#39;good faith&#39;)</li>
<li>How to get it indexed / searcheable? e.g. Google Scholar, DBLP, etc. Currently, limited to select publishers so their websites are selectively targeted for indexing (I assume)</li>
<li>Some system to &#39;declare&#39; an article is now published e.g. OpenCitation + crawler?</li>

</ul>
<h2>Compatibility with tools</h2>
<ul>
<li>Least effort scenario is to use existing tools e.g. output PDF with metadata (title, author)</li>
<li>For HTML articles, need tools to detect and parse article e.g. bibliography tool to detect metadata</li>

</ul>
