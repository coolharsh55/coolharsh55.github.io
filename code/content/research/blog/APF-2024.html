<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://privacyforum.eu/">Annual Privacy Forum</a> is an event organised by the <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/">ENISA</a> (EU Commission's Network and Information Security Agency) and is an academic conference that invites talks related to privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, and associated topics. It is a prestigious event due to its close collaboration and involvement of policy makers as stakeholders, and it is typical to see several data protection authorities, standardisation experts, consumer organisations, and other stakeholders at the event. The event itself was organised across two days from 4th to 5th September, and the <a href="https://www.edps.europa.eu/data-protection/technology-monitoring/ipen/ipen-event-human-oversight-automated-making_en">IPEN</a> event was held on 3rd September before the conference (as is tradition).</p>
<p>The 2024 edition was held at <a href="https://www.kau.se/en">Karlstad University</a> in Karlstad, Sweden, and was co-organised by the EU Commission's <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en">DG CNECT</a> - the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (the section that looks after GDPR, AI Act, etc.) In total, there were (approx.) 62 submissions, of which 12 were accepted for presentation - giving us an acceptance rate of (approx.) 19.5%. The proceedings are <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-68024-3">available online</a>. The next year, APF will (tentatively) be held at Goethe University in Frankfurt with the same approximate deadlines for submissions.</p>
<p>My involvement in the APF this year was to present two papers: <a href="APF-27560-paper">Implementing ISO/IEC TS 27560: 2023 Consent Records and Receipts for GDPR and DGA</a> where I was a lead author, and <a href="APF-AICards-paper">AI Cards: Towards an Applied Framework for Machine-Readable AI and Risk Documentation Inspired by the EU AI Act</a> where I was a co-author. In addition, I also had the chance to 'expose' the audience to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/6qhzj">preprint of a paper</a> recently completed which compared the DPIA guidelines from all 30 EU/EEA DPAs and aligned them with the AI Act to show that GDPR is applicable in most cases. Below are my notes which I took during the event, including certain statements or resources which I found to be interesting.</p>
<p>I was quite pleased to attend the event as also in attendance was the EDPS, and members from the EU Parliament's legal team, ENISA, Data Protection Authorities from Germany (ULD), Poland, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. This meant that the work that I presented was visible to them - and indeed in conversations with them later all three papers mentioned by me were stated to be of interest.</p>

<h2>Favourite Talks</h2>
<p>My favourite talks at the event (not including my own, haha) were:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="orgd0d88b7">Implications of age assurance on privacy and data protection: a systemic threat model - AEPD</a><br/>
    This was a paper presented by the Spanish DPA on developing a systematic approach to understanding the threats of privacy and data protection. My favourite bits in this were that its a DPA following a really cool research approach to their compliance and enforcement knowledge, and that they extended the state of the art to create a new threat taxonomy.</li>
    <li><a href="org9e4fc18">Privacy Technologies in Practice: Incentives and Barriers - @LiinaKamm</a><br/>
    This was a talk that nicely outlined the different PETs that can be utilised and what are the considerations that we should have when adopting them. It also included 'consent receipt' which I had presented in the previous day.</li>
    <li><a href="org37b082b">How to Drill Into Silos: Creating a Free-to-Use Dataset of Data Subject Access Packages</a><br/>
    I liked this talk because it exposed the currently weak nature of Art.20 Data Portability compliance - namely not useful at all because of the unstructured mess that is returned. What I also learned was how Art.20 data is often also related to the other data e.g. Art.15 - which is something I hadn't thought about. The cool part of this work was the creation of a free/open dataset for requests by specific providers for use in research.</li>

<li>theme: Human Oversight of Automated Decision-Making systems</li>
<li><b>Introductory talk by @WojciechWiewi√≥rowski</b> 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>we don't call them problems but call then challenges because they lead to
solutions by the people who design and implement information systems</li>
<li>automation in making important decisions about health, safety, and
fundamental rights</li>
<li>human in the loop does not mean everything is okay</li>
<li>it will be pointless to scrutinise every single decision - instead we have
to identify those decisions which need further introspection to understand
what is happening or what must be understood</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Keynote: "<i>Expectations vs. reality: What we expect human oversight to be and
what it really is</i>" by @BenGreen</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>paper: "The flaws of policies requiring human oversight of human algorithms"
in Computer Law &amp; Security review 2022</li>
<li>Approaches to human oversight:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>restrict solely automated decisions - make human decision making
mandatory e.g. GDPR</li>
<li>require human discretion - human decision makers have ability to override
the automated decision</li>
<li>require meaningful human input - humans can override the system,
understand the algorithm e.g. XAI, and human should not rely heavily on
algorithms, such as in the AI Act</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Assumption of Human Oversight Policies
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>people won't rely on automated systems</li>
<li>people will follow the 'good' recommendations and override 'bad'
recommendations - assuming people will know when to follow the
recommendation and when to ignore/override recommendation</li>
<li>explanations and interpretability improves human oversight - assuming
that people will understand what action to take with the
advice/explanation</li>
<li>overseers will have agency to ignore the automated system - assuming that
there is an ability to do so</li>
</ol></li>
<li>if we don't ensure the policies provide the benefits as expected, then we
don't get the benefits and the system turns into an obfuscated automated
system that has underlying issues</li>
<li>Assumption 1:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>people including experts are susceptible to automated bias</li>
<li>people defer to automated systems</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Assumption 2
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>people are bad at judging the quality of outputs and determining when to
override the outputs</li>
<li>human judgements are typically incorrect and can introduce racial biases</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Assumption 3:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>explanations and interpretability do not improve human oversight, but
instead up up increasing trust in algorithms regardless of the quality of
the algorithm</li>
<li>explanations likely to make people accept incorrect advice - which can
cause people to be more dependent on the system</li>
<li>algorithmic transparency reduce people's ability to detect and correct
model errors</li>
</ul></li>
<li>frontline works face institiutional pressure to follow the recommendations
of the system - and it might be more work for decision makers to ignore the
recommendation e.g. there is paperwork</li>
<li>human oversight policy from automated systems and their developers/providers
to human operators</li>
<li>implications: we need to think broadly how we are going to approach the
design and implementations of automated systems</li>
<li>lessons for regulating automated systems
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>design and training can improve human oversight but cannot solve these
issues - this is not a solution</li>
<li>not using human oversight to justify harmful and flawed automated
systems - many policies call for human oversight which legitimises use of
problematic systems i.e. if a system is prone to errors and issues on its
own, then it is also problematic to use with human oversight</li>
<li>require pre-deployment testing of proposed human oversight mechanisms - to
analyse and understand whether it can work with and produce decisions that
we find acceptable</li>
<li>shift accountability from overseers toward policymakers and developers</li>
</ul></li>

<li><b>Panel: "Human oversight in the GDPR and the AI Act" with @ClaesGranmar
@BenWagner moderated by @DanieleNardi</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Argument by @ClaesGranmar
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>GDPR covers only one right - data protection and privacy whereas the AI
Act covers all rights</li>
<li>Law creates realities, which then become human standards and habits, and
we don't realise it and take it for granted</li>
<li>It is human tendency to push the liability to the system - even if it is
an ineffective system someone must be liable and be held accountable from
the legal perspective. This is why the AI Act addresses the providers and
deployers.</li>
<li>There are no good reasons for why we should not have rules for AI systems
regarding health, safety, and fundamental rights</li>
<li>GDPR is more ex-post-facto whereas AI Act is ex-ante in the sense that
GDPR requires processing of personal data whereas the AI Act is a product
safety regulation and treats the process of certifying and monitoring</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Argument by @BenWagner
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>what is creating problems is the legal frameworks rather than institutions
and policies</li>
<li>Under the GDPR and other regulatory systems there is an impetus to claim
that it isn't an automated system to escape the obligations</li>
<li>The protections that are received should be the same whether its automated
or manual. The presumption of automation should be present throughout the
legal framework.</li>
<li>This avoids problems with systems that seem to be manual but are actually
automated - which we found in our research</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Moderated question: What do we do with what we have and the legal
instruments that we have? @ClaesGranmar - the answer is proportionality of
the law</li>
<li>Audience question: got rejected at border control because of dark skin -
whom to approach if the government is the one who is discriminating (in
creation of AI systems) - moderator: go to ICO as this would be a case of
using biometrics for decision making; but the human in the loop in this case
works; not sure if there is a solution to the human in the loop</li>

@IsabelBarber√°</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>@SarahSterz - Center for Perspicuous Computing
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Art.14 AI Act says human oversight must be effective, but it doesn't state
what is considered effective - creating a framework for when human
oversight is effective</li>
<li>working definition of human oversight: supervision of a system by at least
one natural person typically with authority to influence its operations or
effects</li>
<li>framework:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>epistemic access: human should understand the situation and fundamental
risks and can interact with the system to mitigate risks - understand
system, how it works, outputs, etc.</li>
<li>self-control - can decide path of action and follow through</li>
<li>causal power - power to establish causal connection</li>
<li>with these three things the human can mitigate fundamental risks
reliably</li>
<li>the first three are moral responsibility</li>
<li>fitting intentions - has a fitting intention for their role i.e. the
person wants to mitigate the risks</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Barbara Lazarotto and Pablo Rodrigo Trigo Kramcsak - VUB</li>
<li>GDPR allows multiple legal bases based on wording of Art.6 "at least one of

<li>multiple legal basis is a problem - lack of clarity on how this works</li>
<li>my comment during Q&A: multiple legal bases does not mean we can combine any
  two legal bases and use them - some of them lead to nonsense like using
  Legitimate Interest which is purely opt-out and Consent which is purely opt-in
  together which creates a Schrodinger's legal basis which both is active and
  isn't depending on whether the data subject has consented or
  objected. Instead, multiple legal bases allow for Member States to create
  specific legislations e.g. for public bodies to act in official capacity or
  for private bodies to be required to do something. However, for private bodies
  who have relationships with data subjects, contract would be the legal basis

<h3>My Paper: AI Cards: Towards an Applied Framework for Machine-Readable AI and Risk Documentation Inspired by the EU AI Act</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This paper was led by Delaram, who is doing her PhD on this topic. It was a collaboration with the EU Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) - and I clarified that the views expressed in the paper are those of the researchers and do not reflect the views of the Commission.</li>
    <li>The paper is available <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-68024-3_3">online</a> as Open Access and the slides are avialable <a href="https://harshp.com/presentations/2024/APF-AI-Cards/APF2024-AICards.pdf">online</a> as well.</li>
    <li>The paper describes creation of a human-intended summarised visual overview of the risk management documentation based on the AI Act and the available ISO standards at that point in time.</li>
    <li>The work generated a lot of interest due to the AI Act being a core topic at the event, and because of the practicality of the work.</li>

<li>Apple/Google issuing IDs is a fundamental threat to the social structure of
governance</li>
<li>attribute attestations - claims based authentication
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>issuer I claims that Person P has Value V for Attribute A</li>
<li>selective disclosure - only reveal required attributes</li>
<li>self-sovereignty: decide what attestations to get, and from whom</li>
<li>decouple getting and using an attribute (issuer unlinkability) - present
issuer from learning when and where you use an attribute - significant issue
in social logins</li>
<li>decouple successive uses of an attribute - multi-show unlinkability -
prevent profiling be relying parties using attestation signature as
persistent identifier</li>
<li>still guarentee security of attributes - increased by binding to a trusted
hardware element</li>
</ul></li>
<li>problem 1: attribute attestations in eIDAS 2.0 are lame
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a set of signed salted hashes</li>
<li>can do selective disclosure</li>
<li>issue: decouple getting and using an attribute - issuer knows signature,
signature is revealed to relying party ; when relying parties collude with
issuers, users can be profiled</li>
<li>issue: decouple selective uses of an attribute</li>
<li>solution: issue many attestions with different salts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>better to use attribute based credentials based on zero knowledge proofs which
don't reveal the signature abut prove you have it - which gives true
unlinkability between issuer and relying party
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>issue: not using "state approved" cryptographic primitives</li>
<li>issue: not implemented in current secure trusted hardware components - which
is important because we want to make sure the credentials cannot be copied
to another device which requires hardware level support</li>
</ul></li>
<li>more issues
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>assumes people have smartphones that can run the wallet - which creates
inclusion problems and creates single point of failure</li>
<li>risk of over identification - authenticated attributes supply will lead to
increased demand where these are asked for more than is necessary and
mandatory acceptance on large platforms</li>
<li>under-representation - some entities decide what attributes are designed in
the system and what values are available e.g. age ranges or gender</li>
<li>privacy: requirement in the regulation that you should be able to revoke
attributes and wallet fast - which means the attributes have to be checked
(for validity) often</li>
<li>wallet issuer will know when and where the wallet was used</li>
<li>wallet also proposed for digital euro</li>
</ul></li>
<li>mixing high and low security use cases
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>NL has bonus cards and passports - which have different security levels</li>
<li>but the regulation asserts that both these should be part of the same wallet</li>
<li>people may not understand that the device is used for low and high security
contexts which can create issues such as phishing attacks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>preventing over-authentication
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>encode what attributes the relying part is requesting should be included in
the request to prevent over-authentication</li>
<li>e.g. I need to verify someone is an adult, give me DOB, but instead the
attribute that should be allowed is the is-adult</li>
<li>issuer can specify a disclosure policy - but this is simplistic - no
discloure, disclosure, and a group disclosure - which assumes the issuer can
see all the uses of its attributes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>general observations
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>technical specifications developed without oversight or academic or civil
society participation - which is an issue as the technical specifications
determine real security/privacy properties</li>
<li>problem with standardisation  - costs time and money, influence depends on
level of participation, more stakeholders e.g. NGOs should be involved but
they don't have resources to do this</li>
<li>consultation open till SEP-09 on implementing regulations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>don't make vague implementing regulations, but create one clearly defined
standard and make that mandatory</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Garante / Italian DPA</li>
<li>synthetic data are mentioned in Art.10 of the AI Act regarding mitigation of
biased outcomes and in Art.59 as enabler for further processing</li>
<li>in US, mentioned in the executive order as a PET</li>
<li>synthetic data may create "adverse selection"</li>
<li>training synthetic data generators is a processing of personal data; which
means it needs an appropriate legal basis under the GDPR - even including the
assessment of the legitimate interest where relevant; another factor is the
context of use - e.g. if the synthetic data is to be used for scientific
research the conditions are possibly less stringent. This step should not be
skipped by Controllers.</li>
<li>synthetic data can be so well generated that they are "true personal data" -
which means the synthetic data ends up reproduced as personal data e.g. a
facial generation or generating a phoen number. And therefore this is also the
processing of personal data. The nature of personal data does not depend on
the artificiality of generation, but on the nature and implication of that
data. If synthetic data has a low percentage of some of it being personal
data, then it may still be an issue if the corups is billions of samples</li>
<li>individual's rights must be preserved with synthetic data - primarily the
right to object and to opt out ; but also to consider that using PETs like
differential privacy can end up with private but useless data</li>
<li>synthetic data capture well a median world, but they are not suited for new
discoveries e.g. unforseen new personal data. If there is a strong outlier in
the real world then it would not be reproduced in synthetic data.</li>
<li>synthetic data can create model collapse - e.g. if there is an inference
created based on synthetic data, and then this inference is used for other
inferencing, then the iterations increasingly become conformative and do not
reflect the reality as the distribution is increasingly normalised</li>
<li>synthetic data generation is a transformation of personal data - whether these
transformed data are personal or not does not depend on what the output looks
but on how much original information is kept in the transformation.</li>
<li>its not difficult to use synthetic data in a malicious way, but it is
difficult to discover wrongdoers. This requires more regulatory oversight and
attention.</li>
<li>its all about regulating stochasticity - the issue is not new about whether we
need more complex mathematical model for simulation or do we resort to
synthetic data in a simple sense ; there is a risk of bias and discrimination</li>
<li>the use of synthetic data does not mean prohibiting the use of personal data,
but extracting the value</li>
<li>"If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything" - Ronald
Coase</li>
<li>Garante is organising G7 meeting of DPAs and synethetic data, and some output
or guidance is expected from the event. Synthetic data is also on the agenda
of the EDPB and ENISA.</li>
