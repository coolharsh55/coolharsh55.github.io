    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Identifying and understanding risks of technologies is a difficult task. To add to this, privacy risks are not straightforward or easy to identify and discuss. The <b>RISKY</b> project aims to enable exploration of privacy risks and its mitigations by storing information within a knowledge graph. This information consists of direct and indirect relationships between concepts associated with technologies, privacy risks, and their mitigations. For a more in-depth introduction to this topic, read the <a href="/research/projects/risky/blog001_intro">blog post</a>. RISKY starts in October 2020 and is funded for 2 years until September 2022. All outcomes, deliverables, and publications of this project will be open and freely accessible.</p>

    <h2>Aims and Expected Outcomes</h2>
    <p>The primary aim and driving goal of this project is to <i>enable stakeholders to explore privacy risks and mitigation measures</i>. To make this possible, the project consists of implementing the following objectives. You can read more about the project's deliverables, milestones, and dissemination plan <a href="/research/projects/risky/deliverables">here</a>.
    <ul>
       <li>Develop an ontology for expressing Privacy Risks and its Management</li>
       <li>Build a Knowledge-graph of privacy risks and mitigation measures</li>
       <li>Develop queries for retrieving relevant privacy risks and mitigations based on parameters of given scenario</li>
       <li>Develop an online service for exploration of privacy risks and mitigation measures</li>
