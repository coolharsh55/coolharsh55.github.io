<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Currently, the Solid Protocol and its specifications lack the necessary vocabulary and processes for ensuring transparency and accountability in the use of data. In particular, to deal with the obligations and requirements required by regulations related to (personal) data protection and privacy. In addition, the lack of a guiding vocabulary leads to no common mechanism through which apps can request data and how Solid maintains information about its use. To address these, we propose PLASMA -- a policy language to describe the entities, infrastructure, legal roles, policies, notices, and records to understand and establish responsibilities and accountability within the Solid ecosystem. We present how ontology design patterns using PLASMA can provide a common interface to create structured policies, records, and logs within the diverse Solid use cases, and thereby solve challenges regarding the management and governance of apps and their privacy considerations.</p>
<h2 id="sec:intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>Solid is an initiative led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee to decentralise the
web and provide its users with greater choice when it comes to the usage
of their (personal) data. Solid builds upon web standards such as the
Linked Data Platform (LDP) <span class="citation"
data-cites="ldp_2015"><a href="#ref-ldp_2015"
role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span> or the Web Access Control (WAC)
<span class="citation" data-cites="wac_2022"><a href="#ref-wac_2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span> specifications and, according to its
Protocol <span class="citation" data-cites="capadisli_solid_2022"><a
href="#ref-capadisli_solid_2022" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span>
specification, relies on said standards to <em>“realise a space where
individuals can maintain their autonomy, control their data and privacy,
and choose applications and services to fulfil their needs”</em>. While
it was designed with web’s ethical principles<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> in
mind to share information in a secure and private way, Solid is
currently lacking when it comes to its alignment with data protection
regulatory efforts <span class="citation"
data-cites="panditMakingSenseSolid2023"><a
href="#ref-panditMakingSenseSolid2023"
role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span>, such as the European Union’s
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <span class="citation"
data-cites="noauthor_regulation_2018"><a
href="#ref-noauthor_regulation_2018"
role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></span>.</p>
<p>In particular, Solid lacks practical mechanisms through which GDPR’s
principles of transparency and accountability can be implemented, which
leads to no common mechanism for users or apps to represent or record
information about privacy notices, agreements or giving/withdrawing
consent and exercising of rights. Solid’s access control specifications
only record what entity has been permitted to access which data, but not
the purpose or intent behind that access, nor what will happen
subsequently to that data once accessed. This leads to issues with
regulatory compliance and user disenfranchisement arising from the lack
of actionable ‘records’, and permits the continuation of existing issues
such as the use of dark patterns and manipulations to obtain access.</p>
<p>By taking this situation as a research challenge, we propose PLASMA –
a Policy LAnguage for Solid’s Metadata-based Access control, which
enables responsible and accountable practices to be incorporated into
existing Solid infrastructure and workflows in a way that addresses the
above-mentioned challenges. The work is based on the use of the Open
Digital Rights Language (ODRL), a W3C standard for expressing policies,
along with an additional taxonomy for defining the relevant concepts
present in Solid’s ecosystem. Through this, PLASMA forms a ‘<em>policy
layer</em>’ on top of the existing Solid implementations where users,
apps, and Pod providers can express their relevant information in the
form of policies, and based on which appropriate tools can be developed
to enable functions such as informed consent, data use logs,
machine-readable notices, preference management for users, and their
management through dashboards. In addition to providing the vocabulary,
a series of ontology design patterns (ODPs) can be defined to ensure
apps declare necessary data before being allowed the use of data, and
further to create conformity mechanisms based on this where communities
can assess and curate collections of actors and apps to create
environments of trust.</p>
<p>The contributions of this work are based on the following research
objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Creating a taxonomy of Solid’s entities and infrastructure to
describe the actors and processes involved in the Solid
ecosystem;</p></li>
<li><p>Providing a metadata policy language (PLASMA), using the terms
identified in RO1, to express information regarding legal roles and
other compliance requirements in a jurisdiction-agnostic manner (while
satisfying requirements from GDPR);</p></li>
<li><p>Using PLASMA for defining a set of Solid-related ODPs regarding
users and apps policies, data use logs and registries to provide easy
access to data in Pods.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="sec:background">Background &amp; Related Work</h2>
<p>The Solid Protocol specification <span class="citation"
data-cites="capadisli_solid_2022"><a href="#ref-capadisli_solid_2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span> contains a set of conditions that
resource server developers must fulfil in order to enable Solid servers
to send and retrieve data and that app developers must implement for a
Solid app to perform operations on resources. In addition to this, a set
of Solid specifications<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> build on top of the Protocol are
being developed by the W3C Solid Community Group. In the context of this
work, we focus on the specifications related to the authorization and
application interoperability systems as the background for the
development of PLASMA and present existing research on (i) the
expression of machine-readable policies and auditing metadata in Solid,
and (ii) the alignment of Solid with data protection requirements.</p>
<p>Currently, Solid has two specifications to determine access
authorizations to resources stored in Solid Pods – WAC<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> and
Access Control Policy (ACP)<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <span class="citation"
data-cites="acp_2022"><a href="#ref-acp_2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span>. In WAC, IRIs are used to represent
resources and agents, and authorization statements are stored within
Access Control Lists (ACLs) defined per resource or inherited from the
parent resource. In ACP, access grants are provided to certain resources
and agents based on an <code>acp:Context</code> that describes the
agent’s request for data and the access control resources (ACRs) that
describe who is allowed or denied access to Pod resources using an
<code>acp:Matcher</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Solid Application Interoperability<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>
specification <span class="citation" data-cites="interop_2023"><a
href="#ref-interop_2023" role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span> is being
developed in order to have an interoperability layer in Solid that
allows users and agents to access and manage data stored in a Solid Pod
using distinct applications. However, these specifications do not take
into consideration legal and practical requirements for the access and
management of data nor do they provide a way for apps and users to
express their data handling practices. Regarding auditing, Inrupt’s
Enterprise Solid Server provides an auditing service<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>
which relies on the W3C Activity Streams 2.0 Recommendation <span
class="citation" data-cites="as_2017"><a href="#ref-as_2017"
role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></span> to document audit events in RDF.</p>
<p>To this end, Esteves et al. <span class="citation"
data-cites="estevesODRLProfileExpressing2021"><a
href="#ref-estevesODRLProfileExpressing2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a></span> developed an ODRL profile for Access
Control (OAC)<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> that allows the expression of
machine-readable policies to express individual privacy preferences and
apps’ policies, using data terms from the Data Privacy Vocabulary
(DPV)<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>. OAC was extended by Debackere et
al. <span class="citation"
data-cites="debackere_policy-oriented_2022"><a
href="#ref-debackere_policy-oriented_2022"

data-cites="panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"><a
href="#ref-panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></span> is a W3C community effort, that
provides taxonomies for expressing machine-readable metadata about the
processing of personal data based on legislative requirements, including
legal entities, purposes for processing, legal basis, rights, personal
data categories, and GDPR. In addition, previous work on policy-related
ODPs has been published to describe personal data in privacy policies
<span class="citation" data-cites="pandit_ontology_2018"><a

<p>For alignment with data protection requirements, Pandit <span
class="citation" data-cites="panditMakingSenseSolid2023"><a
href="#ref-panditMakingSenseSolid2023"
role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span> identifies actors and roles, and
investigates GDPR issues applicable to the use of Solid transparency of
information, consent, and exercising of data subject rights. Janssen et
al. <span class="citation" data-cites="janssen_decentralized_2020"><a
href="#ref-janssen_decentralized_2020"
role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></span> also provide an analysis of
personal data stores, including Solid, as a ‘privacy-enhancing
technology’ (PET) and discuss the uncertainties in the designation of
GDPR responsibilities among the involved parties in personal data store
systems, as well as the choice of a proper legal basis for processing
personal data.</p>
<p>Externally, ‘app stores’ such as those maintained by Apple and Google
and ‘package repositories’ such as those maintained by Linux
distributions also feature the use of metadata that developers must
provide in order for their apps to be enlisted in their stores. These
platforms also use this metadata for governing apps, identifying
compatibility, and enforcing guidelines.</p>
<h2 id="sec:challenges">Challenges and Hurdles to the Solid Vision</h2>
<p>This section discusses the challenges of having a transparent,
legally-aligned Solid ecosystem. The following issues were identified
based on an analysis of the literature and the current state of Solid
specifications:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Identity of Solid actors and their roles is
unknown</strong> – Solid users are unaware of who are the entities
proving their Pods or the apps they use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No metadata about Solid infrastructure</strong> – Users
do not have information on which Solid specification their Pod is
running or which functionalities are installed within it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Availability/Discovery of categories of data</strong> –
To have granular access to data in Pods, based on their data category,
Solid apps need to know if they exist and where are they stored in the
Pod.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pod and app providers do not provide information on their
data handling practices</strong> – Pods and apps do not provide
machine-readable privacy notices nor do they declare what data they need
to function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Users cannot express their privacy policies</strong> –
Solid users do not have the tools to express their privacy preferences
and requirements nor to manage incoming data requests or existing
decisions for the use of data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No logging or record-keeping</strong> – No provenance
metadata is recorded for accountability in the Pods, e.g., users do not
keep consent records, nor information regarding who has accessed their
data, what they are doing with it, or changes to their data handling
policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No legal compliance checks</strong> – Solid does not have
tools for users to exercise their GDPR-related rights, such as
withdrawing consent, nor does it provide authorities with the auditing
information to perform investigations.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>While we claim that this is not an exhaustive list of all challenges
that need to be overcome to have a legally-aware Solid ecosystem, the
work on PLASMA that we present in the following sections can be used to
address them.</p>
<h2 id="sec:plasma">PLASMA: A Policy Language for Solid’s Metadata-based
Access Control</h2>
<figure id="fig:plasma-overview">
<img src="img/062-plasma-overview.png" />
<figcaption>Overview of the main concepts included in
PLASMA.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As covered in the previous sections, there is a gap in the
representation of information related to the entities, infrastructure
and processes involved in the Solid ecosystem. While there are existing
efforts at providing legal vocabularies <span class="citation"
data-cites="panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"><a
href="#ref-panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></span>, these are not directly applicable
to Solid use cases. Therefore, through PLASMA, we first provide relevant
taxonomies to describe the actors, artefacts, and processes that are
necessary to describe the use of Solid Pods. This enables us to later
align these with legal terms (in our case – the GDPR). For example, the
entity the data belongs/refers to is called <em>owner</em> in Solid,
whereas the equivalent term would be <em>data subject</em> under GDPR.
In addition, we also identify concepts without direct equivalence in
GDPR or those that can take one of multiple roles. Through this, PLASMA
is able to express a variety of use cases using terms familiar to the
Solid community while also providing their relevance in terms of legal
concepts (from GDPR).</p>
<p>In order to understand and study Solid-related terms and their
current definitions, a review of the existing Solid technical documents
was performed by the authors, in particular of the specifications
related to the authorization workflow, described in Section <a
href="#sec:background" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:background">2</a>. While these specifications
provide a definition for concepts such as Pods, apps or agents in their
documentation, only a handful of them is actually defined in a
machine-readable manner: the <code>interop</code> specification provides
a definition for <code>Application</code>, <code>Agent</code> and
<code>Registry</code> and the <code>acp</code> vocabulary provides a
<code>Policy</code> term. However, no concepts were found in the base
Solid vocabularies to define what is a Pod, a Service, an Entity or
Data. As such, we provide a definition for each of these concepts in the
base vocabulary<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> of PLASMA and link them with the
existing concepts mentioned before, if available. Thus, PLASMA relies on
these base terms as its core concepts to be expanded into distinct
taxonomies for entities, policies, services, registries, and data –
Figure <a href="#fig:plasma-overview" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:plasma-overview">1</a> provides an overview of these
taxonomies. PLASMA is available at <a href="https://w3id.org/plasma"
class="uri">https://w3id.org/plasma</a>, under the CC-By-4.0 licence,
and reuses the available terms in the Solid vocabularies, in line with
FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. Each
taxonomy is discussed below.</p>
<h3 id="entities">Entities</h3>
<p>Currently, Solid vocabularies do not provide terms to describe
entities beyond the existing properties in the <code>acl</code> and
<code>acp</code> vocabularies to describe access conditions for agents,
client applications or identity issuers. In PLASMA, we provide the terms
to describe the providers and/or developers of Solid Pods, apps,
services, data, identity and other Solid-related infrastructure, as well
as terms to describe different types of users – we define
<code>AdminUser</code> as a “User of a Pod that has the administrative
capability to make decisions about Data on a Pod” and
<code>PodAdmin</code> as a “User of a Pod that has the administrative
capability to make decisions about the Pod (separate from Data in a
Pod), such as deleting the Pod, changing identity or other resource
providers”, to potentiate the distinction between users with full
control over data and users with full control over the Pod, a feature
currently missing from the Solid specifications. Regarding the
specification of agents, PLASMA goes beyond the current definition of
Solid in which such entities can be real, e.g., people or parents on
behalf of children, or virtual, e.g., software agents – PLASMA agents
are virtual agents, so as to distinguish them from an entity which
represents a real entity, i.e., those that can be held legally
accountable. These concepts address the C1 challenge identified in
Section <a href="#sec:challenges" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:challenges">3</a>.</p>
<h3 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h3>
<p>PLASMA provides terms to specify the Solid specifications that the
Pod conforms to in terms of behaviour and implementation details, as
well as the specific Solid platform that is installed within a Pod. In
addition, in PLASMA we make a distinction between Solid apps and Solid
services – an app requires human intervention to perform an action on
data with the aim of providing specific purposes or functionalities,
while a service is a functionality that may utilise or interact with
data within a Pod and may not require human intervention, e.g., is
executed in the background. Users can choose services to run on their
Pods, with the services having their own developers and providers, e.g.,
an identity verification service that checks the validity of
certificates. As this is a new concept introduced by PLASMA, we provide
a taxonomy of 11 Solid-related services, which can be further expanded
to take into account new use cases. These concepts address the C2
challenge identified in Section <a href="#sec:challenges"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:challenges">3</a>.</p>
<h3 id="sec:pod-data">Pod-related Data</h3>
<p>Since Solid’s overall purpose is to provide individuals with a data
storage service for their data and the choice of which applications or
services to use for a particular purpose, it should also contain
(meta)data regarding its users, apps, services, logs or registries. In
addition, the recording of this provenance data in the Pods can also be
of assistance to external entities auditing Solid-related activities,
e.g., data protection supervisory authorities in Europe might require
access to said data to investigate a personal data breach. To this end,
beyond modelling metadata about Pod management, users, apps or services,
PLASMA allows the expression of logs – provenance records associated
with Solid processes such as adding/updating a data resource in a Pod,
the reporting of a policy negotiation where the user gave consent to an
app’s request for data, or of an error on the identity verification of a
user. Moreover, the maintenance of a set of registries, e.g., data, data
schema, policy, app or user registries, as an indexed record used to
provide information on the availability of data categories, supported
schemas for data, apps, or services, relevant policies, or apps and
users that have/had access to resources in the Pod. These concepts
address the C6 and C3 challenges identified in Section <a
href="#sec:challenges" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:challenges">3</a>, respectively.</p>
<h3 id="sec:policies">Policies</h3>
<p>In the context of PLASMA, policies are documents used to specify the
requirements of users, apps and services regarding data handling
practices over data stored or shared through Solid Pods. As such, PLASMA
provides definitions for user policies, as well as for data requests,
i.e., a request from an app, service, agent or user to access, use and
perform other actions on Pod data. We envision integrating such requests
in a manifest as defined by the W3C Web Application Manifest
specification <span class="citation" data-cites="manifest_2023"><a
href="#ref-manifest_2023" role="doc-biblioref">[15]</a></span>, which
currently cannot be considered sufficient for an app’s or service’s
manifest in the context of Solid Pods since it does include information
on entities, their identity or data handling policies, which is needed
to have accountability and check for legal compliance. PLASMA also
provides different types of data agreements, a concept totally missing
from the Solid specifications as they only refer to access
authorizations between users and apps. An agreement can be governed by a
contract between the user and the entity responsible for the app,
service or Pod, or can be based on the user’s consent. Furthermore,
current Solid specifications also miss the definition of notices – a
document needed to provide context information about the entities,
operations, or data involved in a particular process, e.g., notices can
be specified to declare the providers and/or developers of apps and
services or to describe data processing practices. In this context,
PLASMA provides the terms to declare an <em>ex-ante</em> and
<em>ex-past</em> notices, as well as privacy notices for apps, services,
Pods and users. These concepts address the C4 and C5 challenges
identified in Section <a href="#sec:challenges"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:challenges">3</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sec:integration">Integrating PLASMA in the Solid Ecosystem
through the Usage of Ontology Design Patterns</h2>
<p>As previously discussed, the current Solid vision does not rely on a
policy-based access control system, but on an access control list (WAC)
or access grant (ACP) mechanism. In addition, it completely lacks the
necessary information to perform an auditing activity on Pods, apps,
services, entities and agents and a proper alignment with data
protection regulatory requirements such as the ones brought on by the
GDPR, which are necessary conditions for the lawful processing of
personal data. In this section, we promote the usage of PLASMA and other
identified semantic specifications to describe a set of ODPs for having
commonly structured representations of policies, registries and logs in
Solid, which can be used to establish responsibilities and promote
transparency in personal data handling practices.</p>
<h3 id="odps-for-specifying-legally-aware-policies-in-solid">ODPs for
Specifying Legally-aware Policies in Solid</h3>
<p>PLASMA defines a set of 3 types of user policies, a
<code>UserPreference</code> – a soft rule that may not be satisfied, a
<code>UserRequirement</code> – a hard rule that should always be
satisfied, and a <code>UserOffer</code> – a policy offer from the user
regarding the purposes, entities and actions that can/cannot be
performed on the data, in addition to the ones specified to characterize
<code>DataRequests</code> and <code>DataAgreements</code>, already
discussed in Section <a href="#sec:policies" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:policies">4.4</a>. While a different ODP can be
established for each type of policy, their main structure remains the
same. For this reason and due to restrictions on the size of this
publication, we present only the ODP for a data request policy<a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. The pattern for request policies
aims to answer the following competency questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What is the unique identifier of the policy?</p></li>
<li><p>Who is the creator of the policy?</p></li>
<li><p>When was the policy issued?</p></li>
<li><p>Who is the assignee of the policy?</p></li>
<li><p>What application/service is being used to access the
data?</p></li>
<li><p>What access mode is being requested?</p></li>
<li><p>What personal data is being accessed?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the purpose for accessing the data?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Since neither WAC nor ACP provide the necessary terms to express
access policies for specific categories of data, with restricted
purposes for usage, or with temporal or spatial constraints, PLASMA
promotes the integration of ODRL, which has a convenient extension
mechanism, into the Solid architecture. Moreover, ODRL already provides
the terms to specify offers as an <code>odrl:Offer</code>, requests as
an <code>odrl:Request</code>, and agreements as an
<code>odrl:Agreement</code> and an ODRL profile for Access Control (OAC)
<span class="citation" data-cites="estevesODRLProfileExpressing2021"><a
href="#ref-estevesODRLProfileExpressing2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a></span>, which invokes data
protection-specific terms using DPV, that can also be integrated into
the Solid ecosystem to express granular permissive and prohibitive
policies related to the access to personal data stored in Solid Pods,
with constraints over purposes, recipients or legal basis for
processing. The DCMI Metadata Terms specification is also used to
specify authorship of the policy, <code>dct:creator</code>, and its
issuance date, <code>dct:issued</code>. A visualisation of the pattern
is presented in Figure <a href="#fig:policy-odp"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:policy-odp">2</a>.</p>

<h3 id="odps-for-logging-and-registries">ODPs for Logging and
Registries</h3>
<p>In addition to pattern-based policies, as previously discussed in
Section <a href="#sec:pod-data" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:pod-data">4.3</a>, PLASMA should be used to
construct a variety of patterns for Solid logs and registries, to assist
in the auditing of Pods, users, apps and services’ activities as well as
to have easy access to data in Pods. Due to restrictions on the size of
the publication, we present only an ODP for a data log and an ODP for a
data registry, while other ODPs will be available at <a
href="https://w3id.org/plasma/odps"
class="uri">https://w3id.org/plasma/odps</a>. The pattern for a data log
aims to answer the following competency questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What type of action, e.g., create, update, erase, is being
performed on the data?</p></li>
<li><p>Who is the entity interacting with the data?</p></li>
<li><p>Who is the entity publishing the log?</p></li>
<li><p>When was the log issued?</p></li>
<li><p>Where is the data being stored?</p></li>
<li><p>What application/service is being used to generate the data, if
any?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The pattern for a data registry aims to answer the following
competency questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Who is maintaining the registry?</p></li>
<li><p>When was the registry created/updated?</p></li>
<li><p>What types of data are available?</p></li>
<li><p>Where is a specific type of data being stored?</p></li>
<li><p>What policy is associated with the data?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Since Solid does not currently support any vocabularies to express
logs, the ActivityStreams protocol<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> can be used to
describe such records. ActivityStreams supports the description of
activity types, such as <code>Create</code>, <code>Add</code>,
<code>Update</code> or <code>Delete</code>, and includes concepts to
associate activities with the entity that performed them,
<code>as:actor</code>, with applications/services that generated them,
<code>as:generator</code>, or with the resources that they are connected
with, <code>as:object</code>. In addition, data registries can be
commonly structured as a DCAT<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <code>Catalog</code>,
where different datasets can be associated with the type of data they
contain using DPV’s personal data categories extension (DPV-PD<a
href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>) and associate them with their
storage location using <code>foaf:page</code>. A visualisation of the

<p>Using PLASMA, an app (and its controlling entity) is able to provide
information or links to information regarding policies for who is the
entity, what are they doing with the data, towards what ends, and other
relevant information. When this information is machine-readable, it is
possible to automatically assess it towards some objective – such as to
ensure that usage purposes are explicitly acknowledged as being of a
certain type (e.g., scientific research) or that data will never travel
outside a jurisdiction. Such declarations can serve as valuable tools in
automating or reducing the effort required to approve apps and requests
where the use of data and Pods occurs within environments such as
clinical research.</p>
<p>Using PLASMA as the basis, we also foresee the possibility to realise
<em>community</em> or <em>collective</em> efforts, such as those
envisioned by the MyData<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> movement, where apps
must conform or satisfy requirements set forth by the collective and are
only then allowed to approach the Pods and users. This is beneficial for
apps as it reduces the number of individual notices and requests it has
to manage, and also for users as they only receive requests that they
know have been approved or vetted by the collective arrangement.
Further, PLASMA also provides a way to use Solid Pods towards the new
Data Governance Act (DGA) <span class="citation"
data-cites="noauthor_regulation_2022"><a
href="#ref-noauthor_regulation_2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[16]</a></span> where the data could reside in the
Pod with a usage policy and a Data Intermediary or Co-operative or
Altruistic Organisation could periodically collect only the policies
available on the Pod to create a common registry of available data and
how it can be reused, without providing direct access to the data
itself.</p>
<p>In terms of legal compliance, more specifically the GDPR, PLASMA
provides a forum for the provision and management of information
comparable to the current privacy policies or notices where users can go
and read details about how the service uses personal data and what are
their options regarding it. It has been well studied and documented that
such policies are hard for people to find, comprehend, and use due to
their length and complex language and that users prefer not having to
read them <span class="citation" data-cites="veale_adtech_2022"><a
href="#ref-veale_adtech_2022" role="doc-biblioref">[17]</a></span>.
Similarly, the privacy notices, such as for consent, have also been
documented to suffer similar issues and malpractices <span
class="citation" data-cites="toth_2022"><a href="#ref-toth_2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[18]</a></span>. Without approaches such as PLASMA,
the use of Solid will also suffer with these existing issues and
additional ones that arise specifically from Solid’s lack of information
or concrete guidance.</p>
<p>In order to make effective use of PLASMA, we emphasise that
additional research and developments are required for the various
possibilities highlighted throughout this article. For example,
currently, there are no semantic specifications for recording or
constructing privacy notices. Since legal requirements are specific to a
jurisdiction, such mechanisms would invariably be tied to the
interpretation of a specific law. Given that we are witnessing a global
convergence of data protection and privacy laws with the general
concepts and structure first emphasised by the GDPR, it is now the
appropriate time to create a common legal vocabulary.</p>
<p>For this, we think that the DPV <span class="citation"
data-cites="panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"><a
href="#ref-panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></span> is a suitable candidate that could
be expanded to be used with PLASMA to declare privacy notices, consent
records, and other pertinent documentation that uses Solid-friendly
terms while still being tied to legal requirements (e.g., GDPR). For
example, using PLASMA, the use case can contain information that an
actor is an App Developer, and with DPV they can assert that they are
merely a Data Processor. Similarly, using PLASMA, the App can specify
where to find its privacy notice, where the contents of that notice can
be described using DPV. The use of ODPs, such as the ones described in
Section <a href="#sec:integration" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:integration">5</a>, will ensure that the appropriate
information based on its legal requirements, e.g., from GDPR’s Article
13/14, is present in the Pod to be consulted. As such, the creation of
patterns for the different types of policies, notices, logs and
registries is of the utmost importance. We have undertaken this work
within the DPVCG and are working towards developing machine-readable
specifications based on standards of ISO/IEC 29184 Privacy Notices and
ISO/IEC 27560 Consent Records, to help in addressing the C7 challenge
identified in Section <a href="#sec:challenges"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:challenges">3</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sec:conclusion">Conclusions</h2>
<p>In this article, we first established the need to have common
taxonomies to describe the entities, infrastructure and processes
involved in the Solid ecosystem, in order to address current challenges
that the Solid vision brings in terms of providing information about the
identity of Pod, apps or other Solid-related services, information
regarding their personal data handling practices or the generation and
maintenance of logs related with important Solid processes, e.g.,
updating a Pod data resource, moving to a different Pod provider, or
deleting a given access authorization from the Pod. To this end, we
propose the integration of PLASMA, a metadata policy language, into the
Solid ecosystem, with the purpose of expressing information regarding
legal roles, agreements, policies, registries of data and logs, taking
into consideration legal requirements, first in a jurisdiction-agnostic
manner and then, in particular, considering GDPR’s specific
requirements. By integrating such a resource in Solid and providing
guidelines on how to comply with it, we promote semantic
interoperability in the terms used by users, Pods, apps, services and
agents in order to help address the identified challenges to the Solid
vision, while considering legal compliance with data protection
laws.</p>
<p>We believe that our work further advances the field of decentralized
storage of personal data, relying on existing Semantic Web standards, by
promoting its integration with legal and social requirements and
therefore providing a more trustworthy and private-friendly environment
for Web users to share their data and gather benefits from it. As future
work, we highlight the need to (i) evaluate the coverage of PLASMA to
deal with the variety of different workflows and use cases, (ii)
integrate the usage of PLASMA, and of ODRL and DPV as well, into the
design of Solid servers, applications and services, (iii) develop SHACL
shapes to check for compliance with the PLASMA specification and the
developed PLASMA ODPs, including the usage of DPV to comply with legal
requirements, (iv) align PLASMA with existing standardization efforts
for privacy notices and consent records and (v) further develop PLASMA’s
patterns to cover different types of notices, logs and registries, while
providing information on entities, policies, etc. as per GDPR’s
requirements.</p>
