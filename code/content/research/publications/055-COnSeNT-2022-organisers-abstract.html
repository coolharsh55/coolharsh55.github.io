<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>As people and businesses increasingly rely on the Web as a medium for
communication, interaction, provision of information, and deployment of
innovative services, such intense data sharing triggers the application
of existing data protection and privacy laws (e.g. ePrivacy Directive
 - <span class="citation" data-cites="leg_ePrivacyDir"><a
href="#ref-leg_ePrivacyDir"
role="doc-biblioref">[leg_ePrivacyDir]</a></span>, GDPR
 - <span class="citation" data-cites="leg_GDPR"><a href="#ref-leg_GDPR"
role="doc-biblioref">[leg_GDPR]</a></span>, and
CCPA/CPRA). These laws govern how valid consent should be obtained and
used for personal data management, laying down strict requirements. Yet
again, with the upcoming ePrivacy Regulation - <span class="citation"
data-cites="leg_ePrivacyReg"><a href="#ref-leg_ePrivacyReg"
role="doc-biblioref">[leg_ePrivacyReg]</a></span>, the
Digital Services Act - <span class="citation"
data-cites="leg_DigServAct"><a href="#ref-leg_DigServAct"

Data Governance Act - <span class="citation" data-cites="regDataGov"><a

Data Act - <span class="citation" data-cites="regDataAct"><a
href="#ref-regDataAct"
role="doc-biblioref">[regDataAct]</a></span>, the data
economy will be changed. Pursuant to such requirements, both research,
policy making and industry move towards increasing transparency, user
empowerment and usability, accountability, and privacy by design to
ensure the required legal compliance framework. This demanding setting
has led to new consent proposals, disciplines, actors and roles.
Standardised user centric consent proposals such as the Consent Receipt

<strong>Consent Management as a discipline</strong> is only now becoming
prominent as an emerging result of the many challenges across various
disciplines, among the legal, technological, sociological, UI/UX and
HCI, privacy, and security domains. Current consent implementation and
its management on the Web is still in its infancy when intersecting
concomitant <strong>actors and their roles</strong>, such as average
(and vulnerable) users, their devices, publishers, consent management
platforms, content providers, third-parties, regulators, and information
itself. The Workshop on Consent Management in Online Services, Networks
and Things (COnSeNT) provides a dedicated venue for researchers,
practitioners, and all stakeholders to discuss and present
investigations, critiques, and advances related to consent and privacy
preferences.</p>
<h3 id="recent-debates-events-and-trends">Recent Debates, Events and
Trends</h3>
<p>In the period of 2021–2022, consent has raised many debates and
several events occurred that have the potential to affect how consenting
takes place in the online and digital world.</p>
<p>For COnSeNT 2022, the call for papers specifically referred to the
following currently discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Phasing out 1<sup>st</sup>/3<sup>rd</sup> Party Cookies</p></li>
<li><p>Privacy-preserving advertising based on consent</p></li>
<li><p>Consenting in/with novel proposals e.g. Google’s FLOC</p></li>
<li><p>User interactions and consent for automation (i.e. AI)</p></li>
<li><p>Internet/Web protocols and standards for Consent</p></li>
<li><p>Role of web browsers in adopting consent mechanisms</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following events and trends of 2021–2022 are particularly
relevant and impactful:</p>
<h3 id="cross-disciplinarity">Cross-Disciplinarity</h3>
<p>COnSeNT is a cross-disciplinary workshop and serves as a forum for
talks and discussions from diverse perspectives, as online consent
management has numerous dimensions. Online consent management first and
foremost poses legal and technological challenges, but also raises
questions in other areas such as psychology, linguistics, human computer
interaction, communication studies, and economics.</p>
<p><strong>Law</strong>. Current and incoming EU data protection and
privacy regulations impact consent management in online services. The
GDPR imposes strict requirements for a valid consent request: it must be
freely given, prior to any data collection, informed, specific,
unambiguous, readable and accessible and revocable (Articles 4(11) and
7 - <span class="citation" data-cites="cristianacookies"><a
href="#ref-cristianacookies"
role="doc-biblioref">[cristianacookies]</a></span>.</p>
<p>A recent decision - <span class="citation"
data-cites="BelgianDecision"><a href="#ref-BelgianDecision"
role="doc-biblioref">[BelgianDecision]</a></span> by the
Belgian Data Protection Authority (APD) highlights some of the most
pressing legal challenges regarding consent. This decision hold that the
Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe’s Transparency &amp; Consent
Framework (IAB TCF) - <span class="citation" data-cites="IABTCF"><a
href="#ref-IABTCF"
role="doc-biblioref">[IABTCF]</a></span>, a consent
industry standard, does not fully satisfy ePrivacy and GDPR requirements
in its current form (also cf.  - <span class="citation"
data-cites="cristianacookies MBS2020 VealeBorgesius CNTBR2021 CNILdec PolishDPA CNIL-Google ICOadtechRTB"><a

role="doc-biblioref">[CNIL-Google]</a>, <a

role="doc-biblioref">[ICOadtechRTB]</a></span>). The
decision asserts IAB Europe’s status as a "controller" of personal data
jointly with the participants of the TCF: publishers, CMPs and ad-tech
vendors for the collection and sharing of the TC string and for
subsequent processing of personal data, as part of OpenRTB. It also
ruled that the current form of the TCF is insufficient for: the purposes
of providing transparency to data subjects, for obtaining consent to
adtech processing and to establish legitimate interests as a legal basis
for processing data subjects’ personal data for profiling - <span
class="citation" data-cites="VNSimpossible"><a href="#ref-VNSimpossible"
role="doc-biblioref">[VNSimpossible]</a></span>.</p>
<p>Regarding incoming legislative initiatives, the current ePrivacy
Regulation proposal – facing trilogue negotiations, is yet to define
relevant aspects of online privacy. For example, whether browsers, and
other software placed on the market permitting electronic communications
( such as automatic privacy signals) will, by default, be set to prevent
tracking individuals’ digital footsteps  - <span class="citation"
data-cites="leg_ePrivacyReg"><a href="#ref-leg_ePrivacyReg"
role="doc-biblioref">[leg_ePrivacyReg]</a></span>. It
will also determine whether the use of tracking walls will permissible.
The EU Parliament recently voted on the proposed Digital Services Act
<span class="citation" data-cites="leg_DigServAct"><a
href="#ref-leg_DigServAct"
role="doc-biblioref">[leg_DigServAct]</a></span> to
include a “ban on dark patterns” relating to consent and to offer
options based on “tracking-free advertising” in case consent is refused
or withdrawn to avoid coercion via tracking walls.</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong>. Consent is a challenge that stems from
technology and, necessarily, approaches for its effective management
will necessarily require novel technologies. Notably, managing consent
is not simply managing the collection point but should involve the whole
lifecycle of personal data. At the moment, we can see three main
approaches that are, likely, complimentary rather than self-sufficient,
at least in the absence of regulations. The first approach consists of
the Consent Management Providers (CMPs), whose role and responsibilities
have been questioned  - <span class="citation"
data-cites="cristianacookies"><a href="#ref-cristianacookies"
role="doc-biblioref">[cristianacookies]</a></span>. The
key strategy is to display a prominent consent request that asks for
user action in an unambiguous (e.g., by clicking a button) and, in
principle, halts data collection until the user’s notification. The
second approach, which is sponsored by CCPAs, is to use simple
notifications, or "signals" such as the <em>Global Privacy Control</em>
(GPC), sent directly from the user agent (often a browser) and,
commonly, which can be asynchronously to a notice (see a comprehensive
overview on consent signals in - <span class="citation"
data-cites="PPFsignals"><a href="#ref-PPFsignals"
role="doc-biblioref">[PPFsignals]</a></span>). The third
approach is to rely on an authenticated user artefact, such as a Consent
Receipt  - <span class="citation" data-cites="jesusharsh3022"><a
href="#ref-jesusharsh3022"
role="doc-biblioref">[jesusharsh3022]</a></span>, that
enables management of the consent lifecycle thus removing the focus from
the point of collection and bringing to the front accountability and
transparency.</p>
<p>Technology is not only crucial for consent implementation.
Technological approaches can provide deep insights into the consent
ecosystem and can allow for automated compliance checks: For example,
scrapers and crawlers can be used to collect data on cookie banners on
large numbers of of websites - <span class="citation"
data-cites="MaxMeasuring"><a href="#ref-MaxMeasuring"
role="doc-biblioref">[MaxMeasuring]</a></span>  - <span
class="citation" data-cites="darkpatternsscrape"><a
href="#ref-darkpatternsscrape"
role="doc-biblioref">[darkpatternsscrape]</a></span>.
The NGO noyb uses automated website-scans to enforce the compliance of
cookie banners with the GDPR on a large scale - <span class="citation"
data-cites="noybterror"><a href="#ref-noybterror"
role="doc-biblioref">[noybterror]</a></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Other social sciences</strong>. Unraveling consent also calls
for social science perspectives other than the legal. Facilitating truly
informed consent requires providing online users with information they
are not only able to perceive and understand but also willing to absorb.
To design functioning consent dialogues that attract online users’
attention and promote an informed decision, it is necessary to consider
psychological and linguistic aspects, and to carry out empirical user
studies on users’ perception and interaction with consent dialogues (cf.
 - <span class="citation"
data-cites="comicsinfographics BotesRossi2021"><a
href="#ref-comicsinfographics"
role="doc-biblioref">[comicsinfographics]</a>, <a
href="#ref-BotesRossi2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[BotesRossi2021]</a></span>).
Furthermore, economic research can provide valuable insights into the
consent ecosystem and contribute to solutions for improving privacy
online. As the processing of personal data for targeted advertising
promises to increase revenues, consent signals might be monetisable,
creating incentives to collect as much consent as possible - <span
class="citation" data-cites="commodification"><a
href="#ref-commodification"
role="doc-biblioref">[commodification]</a></span>. Law
and economics can provide an approach to proposals for regulatory
frameworks that improve online users’ privacy - <span class="citation"

<h2 id="consent-2022">COnSeNT 2022</h2>
<p>The program of COnSeNT 2022 comprises paper presentations, a keynote,
and a panel discussion. At the time of writing, the list of panelists
and the panel description are not yet finalised. This section,
therefore, provides an overview of the accepted papers and the keynote
only.</p>
<h3 id="papers-to-be-presented-at-consent-2022">Papers to be presented
at COnSeNT 2022</h3>
<p>The three submissions accepted for presentation at COnSeNT 2022
discuss aspects of consent from the empirical, conomics and law, and
technical perspective.</p>
<p>In their empirical paper “Conciseness, interest, and unexpectedness:
user attitudes towards infographic and comic consent mediums” - <span
class="citation" data-cites="comicsinfographics"><a
href="#ref-comicsinfographics"
role="doc-biblioref">[comicsinfographics]</a></span>
Xengie Cheng Doan, Annika Selzer, Arianna Rossi, Wilhelmina Maria Botes,
and Gabriele Lenzini examine how users perceive consent mediums beyond
plain text information. Through structured interviews with 24 internet
users in Germany, the authors found significant differences in users’
attitudes towards a consent comic on the one hand and a consent
infographic on the other hand. The authors identify infographics as more
promising for consent especially as they enable users to prioritise
information and skim. Based on the interviewees’ widely varying
attitudes towards the comic, the authors emphasise the importance of
audience fit and tone for presenting information to users.</p>
<p>Nils Wehkamp, in his paper “Internalization of privacy externalities
through negotiation: Social costs of third-party web-analytic tools and
the limits of the legal data protection framework” - <span
class="citation" data-cites="externalities"><a href="#ref-externalities"
role="doc-biblioref">[externalities]</a></span>,
scrutinises third-party web-analytic tools from a economics and law
analysis. The author interprets the data collection and sharing for
web-analytics as externalities, arguing that website owners benefit of
the use of third-party tools, while the data processing negatively
impacts users especially where their data are further used for targeted
advertising. The further analysis explores possibilities for users to
negotiate about the use of such tools in a semi-automated way through
cookie banners. The author points out that, albeit existing data
protection law in theory gives users control over their data, effective
negotiation in practice does not take place.</p>
<p>Laurens Debackere, Pieter Colpart, Ruben Taelman, and Ruben Verborgh
present “A Policy-Oriented Architecture for Enforcing Consent in
Solid” - <span class="citation" data-cites="ConsentSolid"><a
href="#ref-ConsentSolid"
role="doc-biblioref">[ConsentSolid]</a></span>, a
specification for access control over decentrally stored data - <span
class="citation" data-cites="solidproject"><a href="#ref-solidproject"
role="doc-biblioref">[solidproject]</a></span>. To
obtain informed consent in compliance with the GDPR based on the
existing web access model in Solid, the authors propose a layered
architecture comprising two components: an Access Management App that
uses digital signatures to ensure integrity of data controllers’
requests and users decisions, and an Authorisation Agent. Through the
Access Management App data controllers shall create specific Processing
Requests for which online users shall grant and revoke access to their
data, while the authorisation Agent matches access requests with users’
decisions.</p>
<h3 id="keynote">Keynote</h3>
<p>The Keynote speaker of COnSeNT’22 is Robin Berjon, a long standing
computer scientist working in Computer Privacy and Data protection.
Among other works, the speaker was the editor of the HTML5 specification
and, more recently, co-author of the Global Privacy Control
specification at W3C. His keynote addresses the interplay between
informed consent, that necessarily builds on voluntariness, and the
hyper-monetisation that currently drives the Web of Personal Data. The
talk will explore ethical conflicts, the misalignment of procedures and
incentives, and the constraints users see, starting with usability and
human interfaces.</p>
<h2 id="previous-edition-consent-2021">Previous Edition: COnSeNT
2021</h2>
<p>The 1st edition of CoNSeNT<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> was successfully held at
IEEE Euro S&amp;P 2021<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> conference on 7<sup>th</sup>
September 2021. The program of the full-day virtual workshop with
approximately 40 participants from diverse fields and professional
backgrounds comprised six paper presentations, a keynote, and a panel
discussion.</p>
<p>The <strong>paper presentations</strong> provided diverse
perspectives on different aspects of consent and encouraged vivid
interdiscplinary discussions. The workshop started with
interdisciplinary talks with a focus on regulation. Paulina Jo Pesch
shared findings from interviews with members of the Global Vendor List
(GVL) - <span class="citation" data-cites="IABGVL"><a href="#ref-IABGVL"

data-cites="IABTCF"><a href="#ref-IABTCF"
role="doc-biblioref">[IABTCF]</a></span>. This was
followed by Vitor Jesus’ position paper “Pragmatic Online Privacy: the
SftE Approach” - <span class="citation" data-cites="Jesus2021"><a
href="#ref-Jesus2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[Jesus2021]</a></span>, in which
the speaker proposed a “Start-from-the-End" regulatory approach to
re-empower online users. Two papers focused on the translation of legal
requirements to technical solutions. The paper “Representing Consent and

data-cites="humankazzazi2021"><a href="#ref-humankazzazi2021"
role="doc-biblioref">[humankazzazi2021]</a></span>
proposed and applied an interdiscplinary and human-centric approach to
consent solutions.</p>
<p>The <strong>keynote</strong>, titled “Consent ‘spam’ and the
undermining of European data protection law” was given by Dr Johnny Ryan
(FRHistS) – a Senior Fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> (ICCL). The speaker was previously
the Chief Policy &amp; Industry Relations Officer at Brave (the web
browser), and is well-known for exposing the problems of internet-based
surveillance ad-industry and its implications for competition,
anti-trust, and privacy.</p>
<p>The talk presented an in-depth and approachable explanation of how
RTB-based ad mechanisms work, who the actors are, and the involvement of
problematic sensitive personal data. In particular, it focused on the
perceived incompatibilities of such mechanisms with the underlying
principles and obligations of GDPR. The keynote was presented between
Dr. Ryan’s complaint to the Belgian DPA and its decision in 2022  - <span
class="citation" data-cites="BelgianDecision"><a
href="#ref-BelgianDecision"
role="doc-biblioref">[BelgianDecision]</a></span>. As
such, it led to an interesting series of discussions during the Q&amp;A
session with the attendees, which included the CEO of IAB Europe. They
keynote was recorded and is available for viewing online<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Accompanying the keynote and diverse topics presented through papers,
the workshop also featured a <strong>panel</strong> consisting of
experts and stakeholder representatives discussing “Does Consent work?
If not Consent, what else?”. The panel consisted of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Armand Heslot</strong> (CNIL): Head of technology experts
department at CNIL and member of EDPB’s Technology subgroup.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Irene Kamara</strong> (Tilburg university): Assistant

</ul>
<p>The panelists discussed the current state of consenting on the web in
terms of cookie and consent dialogues, the issues surrounding it, how it
relates to the legal requirements (in particular the GDPR), and the
disparities between using consent and legitimate interests within online
advertising mechanisms. While there was no formal conclusion to the
panel, there was a general agreement at the end regarding known issues
and necessity to produce solutions that fix and improve the
situation.</p>
