<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Decentralised data governance has emerged
as an alternative model in response to the challenges of managing data
and privacy in conventional centralised models. ‘Personal Data Stores’
(PDS) are at the forefront of this movement and provide forms of control
over storage and management of data to the individual with the goal of
empowering them. In this article, we argue how PDS, while being
important technological innovations, are challenging to implement in the
current regulatory landscape as the interpretation of responsibilities
under the GDPR is woefully inadequate for decentralised systems. This
represents a challenge to the decentralisation movement and makes it
difficult to empower and protect individuals under the GDPR (data
subjects) using PDS. A thorough understanding of the technological and
legal situation and therefore an interdisciplinary approach is essential
to make policymakers aware of any efforts that still need to be made to
realise the decentralisation paradigm’s goal. We therefore build upon
research investigating GDPR compliance in decentralised data storage and
management but do so through an interdisciplinary lens applied to an
emerging application, Solid, that provides technical specifications for
implementing it as the leading PDS implementation. By taking an
interdisciplinary approach, we consider the interaction between the
legal definitions from the GDPR and the implications of established case
law with Solid’s technical specifications and its possible
implementations. We conclude with recommendations regarding the division
of responsibilities for policymakers, authorities, market participants
and technical developers to simultaneously protect and empower those
involved in the use of PDS, particularly through Solid. Furthermore, the
role of decentralised systems such as Solid is discussed, as well as the
current unclear regulatory landscape surrounding it in the context of
implementing the Data Governance Act (DGA). The implications for further
AI development and within data spaces are also considered.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The conventional model that emerged with the proliferation and
ubiquity of the internet consists of a centralised data governance
structure where organisations collect, store, use, and share increasing
amounts of personal data from individuals data within a single opaque
technical infrastructure to provide services and to further their own
interests. In response to this, decentralisation has emerged as an
alternative governance solution. Power through, for example, forms of
control and decision-making is thereby spread across a network of
participants rather than relying on a single central authority. The
best-known initial example of decentralising power was peer-to-peer
(P2P) which was a network for sharing files and information, most
famously used by Napster in 1999 and led to the creation of BitTorrent
and other decentralised internet-based protocols in 2001.[<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>]
Since that time, decentralised services have emerged in various models
and modalities – such as for syncing files across devices, using ‘cloud’
servers to process information, and recently in Bitcoin and its
underlying blockchain technology.[<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>] Following that
development and taking into account the GDPR’s focus on an individual’s
ability to exercise a form of control over their personal data
processing, legal scholars also began to focus on the benefits of
‘Personal Information Management Systems’ (PIMS) or ‘Personal Data
Stores’ (PDS) as technologies meant to provide individuals with access
control [<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>] and transparency over their
personal data. Processing data across multiple storage locations,
managed by individuals, is thereby considered an alternative to the
current context of centralised data processing.[<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>]
Even the European Commission recognised the importance of PIMS and PDS
in its recent Data Strategy[<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>], and in the creation of
regulations such as the Data Governance Act (DGA)[<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>]
and Data Act[<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>] which take into account
decentralisation to manage control over information, and to provide the
individual with an easier way of managing this control through roles
such as ‘data intermediaries’ and responsibilities to support
individuals in decision making regarding their data – such as regarding
consent.</p>
<p>Although PIMS and PDS represent important technological innovations,
we argue that the legal landscape in the European Union (notably GDPR
and its division of responsibilities) is insufficiently equipped to
follow the evolving decentralisation paradigm. The legal landscape has a
significant impact on the functioning of PDS services function within
the market and on their societal and individual effects. For example,
only those actors who have a clear comprehension of their
responsibilities as either a controller or processor under the GDPR are
able to put in place necessary processes and safeguards and indicate to
the data subjects what responsibilities they should expect from such
services. Only with such transparency and accountability can data
subjects using PDS be simultaneously protected and empowered – otherwise
there will be neither protection nor empowerment as responsibilities
remain unclear both legally and in implementations. A thorough
understanding of the technological and legal situation is thus essential
to make policymakers aware of the efforts that still need to be made to
evolve the interpretation of regulations such as the GDPR towards
decentralised and individual-empowering paradigms.[<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>]</p>
<p>In this article we address the challenge of a decentralised system to
practically implement the GDPR and empower individuals by focusing on
the leading PDS solution – called Social Linked Data (Solid). We choose
Solid in particular as it is the only PDS that has a sufficiently
advanced technical specification and has been deployed in practice by
both government and industry actors, and enjoys significant attention in
academic research. Moreover, the data are stored in a format following
the principles of Linked Data[<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>] that applications using
data understand, and so that the context, business logic and implicit
assumptions around the data are immediately clear. This facilitates the
extraction of value and knowledge. In this context, the concept of Solid
can also be seen to play a role within the overarching narrative of data
spaces. It could be argued that the Solid technical specifications serve
a role within the context of data spaces, defining the decentralised
manner in which data is stored and accessed with forms of control for
data providers. In this respect, the Solid technical specifications may
be seen as a foundation for the technical development of data spaces.
Although there is no universally accepted definition of a data space, it
can be most accurately described as an environment, delineated by a
governance framework and underlying technical infrastructure, that
adheres to specific design principles. The objective is to facilitate
secure and reliable data transactions between organisations that are
participating in that particular data space.[<a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>]</p>
<p>By investigating Solid, our arguments also provide knowledge and
direction to other PDS implementations regarding how to approach and
implement the concepts and requirements from the GDPR. To assist the
reader in understanding Solid, we first introduce Solid and its
different configurations within Section II which highlights the novelty
of Solid in implementing PDS using ‘linked data’ to store, manage
access, and authorise applications as compared to other PDS approaches
that are limited to applications on individuals' devices that store and
process data. In addition, in line with the vision of Tim Berners-Lee[<a
href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>], we also interpret the use of PDS
and Solid implementations with existing cloud infrastructures (as
defined by NIST)[<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>] to better understand and interpret
how the underlying technical systems will be provisioned and used, and
as a result how the GDPR should be interpreted and applied to these.
Through this, we offer clarity regarding implication of GDPR’s
obligations and rights for users and organisations, and more importantly
enable enforcement agencies and policymakers to better understand how
they can investigate uses of Solid or similar PDS technologies and to
provide timely guidelines regarding the division of responsibilities in
such decentralised ecosystems in order to optimally protect and empower
data subjects using PDS.</p>
<p>The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section II introduces
Solid and the key adoptions of its technical specifications. Section III
elaborates on the determination of controllers as per GDPR and
established case law. In Section IV we interpret Solid’s technical
specifications and implementations for GDPR, and present in Section V
the analysis for determining controllership. In Section VI we discuss
the implications of this work on the use of PDS in line of recent
regulations – namely the Data Governance Act (DGA) and the development
of AI. Finally, Section VII discusses the practical implications of our
findings and concludes the article by providing recommendations for
policymakers and researchers in the field.</p>
<h2>Solid and key adoptions of Solid specifications</h2>
<p>While PDS represent a broad conceptual framework for how
decentralised systems can facilitate individual control and management
over personal data, we focus specifically on the Solid Project, led by
Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, that uses the PDS paradigm to realise its
goal of empowering users regarding their personal data.[<a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>]
Solid is a set of open technical specifications currently being worked
on within the W3C[<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>] for implementing a personal data
store called a ’Pod’ that stores the personal data, and uses access
control mechanisms through which users can control who (e.g.
applications) can access which data (e.g. a file at a specific path).
Moreover, the data are stored in a format following the principles of
Linked Data[9] that applications understand. In this respect, Solid aims
at decoupling the abundance of centralised data, applications and
identities on the Web and standardise (e.g., via shared ontologies,
vocabularies, or schemas) the interactions between those decoupled
elements.[<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>] This decoupling is consistent with
the observation that modern data-driven supply chains are increasingly
comprised of services provided in a modular fashion.[<a href="#fn16"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>]</p>
<p>Our choice of using Solid as the exemplar PDS in a legal analysis is
based on the following reasons: First, it is one of the few PDS
technologies that have been developed and have already been put on the
market (see Fig.1). Second, it consists of commercial and research
variations, both involving prominent and high-profile researchers.
Third, it is the first PDS to have been provided to citizens by a
government (namely the Flemish Government’s Athumi project).[<a
href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>] Fourth, apart from PDS
technologies focusing on the user, Solid aims to transform the current
style of data governance and application interoperability to one based
on Web Standards to automate governance using machine-readable
information.</p>

<h2>Determination of Controllers under GDPR</h2>
<p>GDPR Art. 4 (7) defines a ’controller’ as an actor who alone or
jointly with others (as ’joint controllers’, GDPR Art. 26 (1)),
determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data,
and can be any legal persons such as commercial actors and public
authorities, or even natural persons. Actors which meet these criteria
assume the role of controller(s), and are accountable for ensuring and
demonstrating compliance with the GDPR (GDPR Art. 5 (2)). Analogous to
this role are ’processors’ (GDPR Art. 4 (8)), who process personal data
under the instruction of controllers. The concepts of ”controller” and
”processor” are functional and autonomous concepts that assign
responsibilities according to their factual roles in use-cases and are
interpreted according to EU data protection law.[<a href="#fn23"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>]
Since how such roles are determined forms one of the key criteria for
establishing accountabilities and liabilities in GDPR investigations, we
first establish a ’boundary criteria’ based on existing case law and
doctrine related to “determining” the ”purpose” and ”means” of
processing through which controllers are defined under the GDPR.</p>
<p>Before delving deeper into the qualification of an actor as a
controller, it is necessary to understand the implications of this role
as the controller bears the greatest degree of responsibility.
Controllers must demonstrate compliance with the principles relating to
processing of personal data (e.g., deciding on the lawful bases of the
processing) (GDPR Art. 5 and 6), they must inform data subjects as well
as (re)act on the exercise of data subjects’ rights (GDPR Art. 12-23).
Likewise, controllers need to implement appropriate technical and
organisational measures (GDPR Art. 24), maintain a record of the
processing activities (GDPR Art. 30), notify authorities and data
subjects when a data breach occurs (GDPR Art. 33 and 34), and perform
data protection impact assessments when processing may pose high risk to
the rights and freedoms of natural persons (GDPR Art. 35). When multiple
controllers qualify together as joint controllers, they need to
determine their respective responsibilities under the GDPR, especially
regarding transparency and the exercise of data subject rights (GDPR
Art. 26). Determining who acts as a controller within the Solid
ecosystem is thus important for the allocation of multiple
responsibilities under the GDPR, hence ensuring a high level of data
protection (protecting data subjects using PDS).</p>
<p>The definition of ‘controller’ in GDPR is based on three elements:
“determine,” “purposes” and “means” (GDPR Art. 4 (7)).[23] These
elements have been further clarified in case law over the years, albeit
always in a specific context. We apply these elements in the discussion
that follows at a more abstract level as ‘boundary criteria’, always
keeping in mind that the specific context at stake may lead to other
elements playing a decisive role. ’Determining influence’ over purposes
and means is approached functionally and refers primarily to the factual
influence a controller has over the processing.[<a href="#fn24"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>,
<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>, <a href="#fn26"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>,
<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>] Controllers need not process the
data or even have access to it or knowledge that data is being processed
to bring about this de facto influence. [19, 20, 21, <a href="#fn28"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>,
<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>] The decision on the purpose of
processing concerns the ‘why’ of the processing.[19, 21] The controller
determines to what end a certain processing operation takes place.[18]
Under article 5(1)(b), these purposes must be “explicit (sufficiently
unambiguous), specified (sufficiently defined) and legitimate (compliant
with the law)”, and the data may not be processed in a way incompatible
with the purpose.[8, <a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>] The means of the processing
consist of the ‘how’ and are conducted via decisions by the controller
on the essential means of the processing.[18] While controllers
determine the essential means linked to the purpose and scope of the
processing, both controllers and processors can determine the
non-essential means. Essential means include determining which type of
data and more specifically which categories of data will be processed to
achieve a certain purpose; who has access to the data for that purpose;
for how long the data is processed; how and where data is stored; and
what security measures are needed depending on the specific context to
achieve a certain purpose in line with the obligations under the
GDPR.[18] These mainly refer to the concrete ability of actors to
protect the personal data of data subjects and take (preventive) actions
against possible breaches.[<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>] Further, a broad
discretion to undertake other processing activities (creating derived
data and manipulating the data) can be considered selecting the means to
process data.[<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>] The non-essential means can be
decided by either the controller or the processor and relate to the more
practical implementation aspects of processing, thus complementing the
essential means.[<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>]</p>
<p>Different actors can potentially qualify individually as controllers
or together as joint controllers based on their involvement in
determining specific aspects of processing. For joint controllers,
obligations are carried out by all actors that jointly determine the
purpose and means of processing, which do not need to be divided
equally[18] and can be based on prior established arrangements.[18, 21]
The joint controller relationship may be close, with all aspects
concerning the determination of goals and means being shared equally
(complementary decisions), or loose, with only one or even part of one
element being shared (converging decision).[18] Further, decisions of
all actors should be necessary for the processing in a way that has
tangible consequences for determining the purposes and means of the
processing. In other words, the processing would not be possible without
the participation of each party, the processing of each party is thereby
inextricably linked.[18].</p>
<p>The notion of (joint) controllership has been broadened in case law,
including previous cases where actors were established as controllers
without giving written instructions to another actor but based solely on
their factual influence on the processing.[20] Joint compliance with
certain policies of another actor also led to a qualification of joint
controllership in this respect, although it is not necessary for the
determination of purposes and means that written guidelines are
available.[<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>] The combination of an increasingly
complex supply chain and the provision of services in a modular manner
with regard to data processing has given rise to questions as to whether
having an economic interest [<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>] or a particular role
within the ’chain of processing’ [<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>][<a href="#fn37"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>]
is sufficient to jointly determine the purpose of processing. However, a
mere commercial advantage is not enough. However, a mere commercial
advantage is not enough.[18] Similarly, regarding the provision of
certain ‘means’ (e.g., platforms, standardised tools, and
infrastructure), the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that actors
jointly determine means by using technology of another actor to process
data, when the technology provider also processes data through that
technology to pursue its own (business) interests.[23, 24, <a
href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>, <a href="#fn39"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>]
Further, the selection or configuration of technologies that influences
the processing of data can also lead to joint controllership.[23, <a
href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a>] However, the influence exerted
must relate to the processing of personal data itself and not just be a
prior step (e.g. if an actor determines parameters of a particular
application during its development).[<a href="#fn41"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a>]
Where the provider of a certain technology makes the technology
available without further influence on how the technology and settings
were used for the concrete processing activities, the provider qualifies
as a processor.[<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>, <a href="#fn43"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a>]
The problem with this interpretation is that cloud service providers
today are sometimes the only ones with the technical expertise required
to use the technology (e.g. the way data is collected, handled and
transmitted).[<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>] The fact that they are able to
protect personal data and take action against potential breaches as well
as impose proprietary data retention policies to customers using their
technology, may also play a role in this regard.[27] Regulatory
frameworks that impose obligations on certain technology providers
regarding the management of certain technical resources or means may
also be an indication of their factual influence in that regard. Yet,
such distinctions remain a fine line in practice which become clearer
slowly through case law and DPA decisions. For example, the French DPA
CNIL established that Discord, a chat software provider offering
customers the opportunity to set up and manage their own server based on
their implementation of the software, was still subject to obligations
as a controller.[<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a>]</p>
<p>In summary, the qualification of controllers and joint controllers
depends on the determination of purposes and essential means by
exercising factual (not formal) influence on the type of data being
processed, on who has access to data and for how long and so on.[<a
href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>] Likewise, the ability to use
technical settings to exercise influence on the way data is processed,
for example by using a particular technology to pursue specific (self)
interests during the processing may lead to qualification as a
controller. However, the ever more complex supply chain regarding data
processing means that more and more several parties exert factual
influence or pursue their own interests via the use of a particular
technology.</p>
<h2>Solid as per GDPR’s Definition of Processing</h2>
<p>Solid is a set of technical specifications that has as its main
objective to decouple applications from the data they use as well as
from the identification solutions they provide. Solid adds a layer, so
to speak, to the existing Web with standard authentication and
authorisation as well as standardised data sharing. Users are thereby
also offered means to manage their own data in Pods - which is a
decentralised storage system comparable to hosting their own web server.
Solid Pods enable users to decide who has access to the data through a
permissions-based ‘access control’ system. This mechanism enables the
construction of ‘Web applications’ that request authorisation to access,
modify, or utilize the data stored within the Solid Pod. As Solid Pods
are implemented over the internet, they also have servers and providers
as the underlying technologies and actors. As Solid Pods are implemented
over the internet, they also have servers and providers as the
underlying technologies and actors. In order to gain a deeper
understanding of how Solid specifications and Pods are implemented and
to align their use with the concepts set out in GDPR, we draw upon
recent work that establishes interpreting Solid as a form of 'cloud
technology' (in accordance with the definitions set out by the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)).[12,<a href="#fn47"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>]
This approach enables us to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the
GDPR[<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a>] and to apply existing guidance
regarding the utilisation of cloud-based services under the GDPR.[<a
href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>] Based on these, we present our
analysis in several parts, as visually illustrated in Figure 2,
pertaining to infrastructure and data storage within Pods, using data
within Pods, and transfers of data outside Pods.</p>

<h3>Actors within the Solid Ecosystem</h3>
<p>Solid itself is a set of specifications that must be implemented and
can involve multiple actors for the provision of resources associated
with storage, identity, web domains, etc. While the Solid specifications
do not formally describe all the roles defined below [<a href="#fn50"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a>],
we use them based on prior work to provide a consistent terminology
aligned with existing cloud technologies that can be interpreted for
GDPR.[48] These roles are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <em>Provider</em> is an actor that makes resources available
(e.g., Data Provider, Infrastructure Provider, ...).</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>Pod Provider</em> is a specific “Provider” that is
responsible for providing the ‘Pod’ i.e. as a decentralised data storage
service, either directly or through an intermediary actor.</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>Data Subject</em> is the natural person who is the subject
of the personal data (GDPR Art. 4 (1)) stored within the Solid
Pod.</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>Pod User</em> is an actor that uses a Pod and can be
different from the Data Subject. Unless otherwise stated, however, the
hypothesis is that the Pod User is also the Data Subject as we focus on
the scenarios involving data subjects using their own Solid
Pods.</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>Third Party</em> refers to an actor in the sense of GDPR
Art. 4 (10) i.e. where it is not the controller or processor or data
subject in the context of a Solid Pod.</p></li>
<li><p>An <em>Application</em> is a system representing an actor that
reads, writes, erases, or performs other processing operations on data
in the Pod, most commonly for the purpose of offering a specific service
to the Pod User.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By interpreting these roles with cloud technology provision methods
(e.g. IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS), we gain a better understanding of the
capabilities and control available to each actor. For example, Pod
Providers have the capacity to affect processing operations through
controlled resources (in the form of decentralised data storage services
such as by using immutable data storage or the imposition of operational
restrictions) even if they do not manage access control over the data in
the Pod. Therefore, for Solid Pods, it is also essential to understand
who controls the resources since these are separate from the Pod User’s
access controls (so-called permissions according to the technical
specifications). In these, an important distinction is how the Solid
specification allows for multiple roles of Data Subjects, Pod Users and
Pod Providers for the same Pod, depending on the factual situation. A
Data Subject can be the Pod User and Provider at the same time, e.g., an
individual implementing the Solid specifications on their own server to
create decentralised data storage for themselves. A Data Subject might
also be the Pod User but not the Provider of the Pod, e.g., where a Pod
has been provided to the customer by their bank (as Pod Provider) for
storing statements. Similarly, a Data Subject might be neither the Pod
User nor the Pod Provider if only their personal data is stored in it,
but they are not given access or any form of access control over such
data. This is the case, for example, if an organisation stores the data
subject’s personal data in a Pod without providing them control over it
or restricting the control they have over it (e.g. they can only ‘read’
data). In this list of actors, we have not included ‘agent’ which is a
technical concept defined within the Solid specifications and represents
software acting as an automated or virtual agent, because such actors
cannot assume legal roles under law. We therefore consider agents to be
associated with or acting on behalf of one of the actors listed
here.</p>
<h3>Limits of the current permission-based system to manage data in
the Pod</h3>
<p>Solid specifications[<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>] provide Pod Users
with the ability to set permissions which determine which actors such as
Applications have the capability to read, write (and modify), or erase
data within the Pod. Even though Pod Users can grant permissions to
other actors, the Solid specifications do not yet provide the ability to
associate such permissions with a ’purpose’ to specify ’why’ the data is
being read, written, or modified. Though the concept ’Access Need’[<a
href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>] is provided with permissions to
describe why some data is required by an actor seeking access to certain
data in the Pod, it does not cover the spectrum of all operations beyond
reading, writing, and modifying data within a Pod. Therefore, from a
purely technical perspective, it is not possible on the one hand, as a
Pod User, to express for what purposes certain data can be processed. On
the other hand, it is also not possible for an actor such as an
Application to express why it wants to process personal data within a
Pod. The permissions are too broad for this. In that regard, <em>ex
post</em> auditing or investigating whether data was used for those
purposes is less enlightening at the moment. Consequently, given the
current situation, there must be some other mechanism (outside the Pod),
such as a contract, consent agreement or privacy policy, that provides
information on the purpose and legal basis of the activities. Given
Solid's emphasis on existing Web standards, this information can be
provided in an interoperable manner (following Linked Data principles)
by extending the existing protocols – though no such approach exists at
the moment. From a GDPR perspective, these mechanisms which determine
control over data are thus important indications in helping determine
who the controller ultimately is by looking closely at how these
mechanisms support the ‘determination’ and ‘means’ of ‘purposes’.</p>
<h3>Infrastructure of Pods following existing cloud-models</h3>
<p>Following existing well-established models for provisioning cloud
technologies, we extrapolate similar models for providers of Solid Pods
and associated resources where actors have varying degrees of freedom to
control the resources.[45] For example, a Pod can be obtained from an
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider[<a href="#fn53"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a>]
where Pod Users are responsible for installation and management of
software to operate the Pod (in this case the Data Subject can be the
Pod User as well as Pod Provider). Similarly, when a Pod is obtained
from Platform as a Service (PaaS), the Pod User is still responsible for
installation and management of applications. Lastly, Software as a
Service (SaaS) implies that Pod Users have lesser freedoms to manage
underlying resources - which are instead managed by the Pod Provider to
provide convenience of use. Access to the service is often possible via
the internet in this respect.[<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>] For example, similar
to accessing the BBC iPlayer via the internet or via an application, BBC
(UK) has announced provisioning Pods to store their service-related data
where the BBC remains the Pod Provider and the Pod Users (data subjects)
are provided with access control over the data through Solid’s
permissions system.[<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a>] Similar to the case of Discord as
set out in Section III, however, Inrupt here provides infrastructure
software[<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a>] that allows BBC to set up and
manage their own Pod server based on their implementation of that
software. In this case, under GDPR interpretations, Inrupt may also have
certain obligations as a controller or joint controller towards the Pod
User if they are effectively so qualified because the concrete context
shows, for example though unlikely, where they sufficiently control how
the technical means are utilised to manage access to the data and
specify or restrict how the data can be processed - in other words, that
they have a say in determining the purposes and essential means of
processing (this interpretation follows the recent interpretation by the
CJEU regarding technical specifications determining the role of
controller.[<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a>]</p>
<p>Following the criteria established regarding processing means and
purposes in Section III, the specifics of how a Pod is provisioned, who
has control over which resources, and who manages the operations over
data are important considerations for identifying controllers. Cloud
providers often shift responsibilities to their business users in
existing agreements. In reality, however, it can be argued that cloud
providers in practice can also exercise significant control over the
purposes and essential means of processing.[31] Therefore, depending on
the situation at stake, they may also bear responsibilities and qualify
as a controller or joint controller together with the user of the cloud
service. In case the user of a cloud service is a Data Subject, the
existing models of cloud providers, consisting of IaaS and PaaS
providers, typically have processor agreements with their users. On the
other hand, SaaS providers which have direct control over their
resources typically have agreements as a controller and assume the GDPR
obligations arising from that role. In the case where Data Subjects
themselves set up their Pod and thus only rely on an IaaS or a PaaS,
this leads to interesting questions regarding the ability of Data
Subjects to have a say in determining the purposes and means of
processing for various processing operations. Furthermore, given the
emphasis placed on data sovereignty and forms of control over subsequent
data usage in Data Spaces, this question becomes increasingly tangible
and relevant.</p>
<h3>Data Storage in Solid Pods</h3>
<p>For data to be stored within Pods, the data must come from a source
(e.g., the Data Subjects themselves can upload a file, a Data Provider
can send a file to the Pod, or an Application or Pod Provider can write
data to the Pod). Further, this data can be a copy of existing data
(i.e., transferred to the Pod), it can be newly provided or generated
data, or even data inferred from existing data.</p>
<p>However, with regard to the processing operation "storage", several
situations can arise that have an impact on the qualification as a
controller. When a Data Provider writes and thus stores data into a Pod,
it is not (alone) in a position to determine the purpose of and means
for further processing of this data in the Pod. That is, party A may
upload something and intend party B to read it for a well-defined
purpose, but instead party B ends up reading it for a different purpose
and a controller to controller relationship arises. Moreover, the Data
Provider may use techniques such as obfuscation or encryption that limit
or prohibits subsequent use of the data by other actors. From a GDPR
perspective, ‘storage of personal data’ is a processing operation, and
therefore the determination and means of storing data are also relevant
for assuming the role of a controller. Therefore, in Solid pods, along
with understanding capability of actors regarding adding or modifying
data, it is also important to consider the factual impact of these
actions in permitting or prohibiting other actors from using that
data.</p>
<h3>Using Data in Solid Pods</h3>
<p>Data stored in Pods can be accessed by authorised actors as defined
by the permission mechanism. To do this, the Solid specification
requires requests to be made via HTTP using WebID - a web domain-based
form of identifier. Authorised actors can then read, write (capacity to
modify existing data or infer new data to be stored in the Pod), or
delete the data in a Pod, depending on the operations permitted by the
permission mechanism. These operations correspond to several processing
categories as defined in GDPR Art. 4 (2) such as collect, obtain,
retrieve, transfer or use (read), erase, modify, or store (write and
erase). Notably absent from this list are operations regarding derived,
inferred, or other transformations over data, which are essential to
understand whether an actor is only reading existing data or also
deriving and thus storing new data - and if it is within its remit as a
controller or processor. In other words, essential to determine whether
an actor determines the purposes and means of processing and thus has
the capacity and obligation to protect Data Subjects using PDS. However,
the granularity of operations in the Solid specification, specifically
read and write, is currently too broad for interpreting GDPR’s
requirements accurately. Similarly, the concept of ‘access’ and
‘read/write’ in Solid is far too vague for interpreting implications of
GDPR when the data is being transformed (e.g. in another format or
structure) or is being stored in an encrypted form that can only be
correctly understood by a particular actor. In such cases, though the
data resides within the Pod, only the particular actor who knows its
structure or can decrypt it can utilise it. Thus, though Pod Users can
control the permission for using data, in reality a large amount of
control is still possibly retained by Applications regarding the
processing of data in a Solid Pod.</p>
<h3>Data Use, Sharing, and Transfers outside Solid Pods</h3>
<p>The Solid specification is restricted to considerations only
regarding the access and storage of data within a Pod. However, there
can be several instances where data is used, transferred, shared, or
otherwise exists outside the Pod. For example, an actor may read data
from the Pod and keep a copy on its own servers. Copying data outside
the Pod may in the future even be required to meet, for example, legal
(e.g., in the public sector) or contractual requirements. Data existing
outside the Pod possibly relates to two conditions - first where an
actor provides data outside the Pod for storage within the Pod, and
second where the actor such as an Application is copying data or even
inferring new data outside the Pod and may or may not store it
externally. The current Solid specifications do not define the concept
of ’data source’ or provide a way to track provenance of data as it is
added, copied, or removed from the Pod. The permissions only represent
the ability to read, write, or modify data within the Pod without
providing any obligation or capabilities for expressing or controlling
activities outside the Pod. This means that a Pod User’s control over
data as expressed through Solid’s permissions is limited only to
processing taking place within the Pod.</p>
<p>The specific limitation of considering operations only within the Pod
and the lack of control over external data leads to potential loopholes.
For example, an Application can obtain data from the Pod, generate
additional data based on it, delete the obtained data, and still retain
the additional generated data without violating any of the Solid’s
currently provided permissions. This has important implications for
GDPR, as the role of Solid as a technical specification does not cover
all potential processing sufficiently and necessitates separation of
processing of data within and outside a Pod. Nevertheless, the question
of whether there is a copy of the data outside the Pod, who controls
said data, and to what ends it is used, are important considerations
regarding the determination of controllership under the GDPR and
consequently also considering the simultaneously empowering and
protecting Data Subjects using PDS. Encapsulating a “trust envelope” in
the data, which describes additional context such as history and destiny
of the data, can be a first step towards a solution. Indeed, data is
stored in Pods through the use of data models (such as RDF) to add
semantics to those data. Data is thereby encoded in an overarching
design that makes searching, understanding and using data from Pods
easier. The interrelationships between data in a dataset thereby become
understandable to computers. Consequently, so does the meaning of the
data. Using such an envelope can create mutual trust between the
provider and user of the data and has an impact on data leaving Solid
Pods.[<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a>]</p>
<h2>Identifying Controllers within the Solid Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Based on the legal and technical analysis of Solid, we now present
our arguments regarding the identification of controllership for actors
within use-cases associated with the Solid ecosystem. Where Pods contain
personal data, different actors in the ecosystem could qualify as
(joint) controllers or processors based on the broad interpretations of
personal data[<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a>, <a href="#fn60"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a>,
<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a>, <a href="#fn62"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a>],
as well as processing and controllers (as shown above). In addition,
through the potential merging of personal and non-personal data in a
Solid Pod, the entire data can be considered personal data where they
are inextricably [<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a>] linked to a Data Subject through
the Pod. Even different Pods can be linked to the same Data Subject via
their associated identifier (e.g., webID) which potentially qualifies
the data in all those Pods as an interconnected set of personal data
too.</p>
<h3>Control over the Processing</h3>
<p>Based on Figure 2, we examine below which actor for each possible
processing operation in the Solid ecosystem (collection, storage,
use/deletion/sharing) could potentially qualify as a controller or
processor by following the current legal doctrine and case law. Although
case law is always context-specific, we look at the general criteria
established in such case law and seek parallels with the Solid ecosystem
with the aim of formulating a preliminary legal analysis. As mentioned
before, we draw on existing work that establishes the terminology and
relevance of GDPR by considering Solid as a cloud technology. The actors
involved in the ecosystem should qualify as a (joint) controller or
processor within the meaning of GDPR in such a way that sufficient data
protection compliance is ensured in practice. Only in this way can Solid
be effective in simultaneously protecting and empowering Data Subjects
and provide incentives to establish a market economy based on legal
certainty. Too much fragmented responsibility can lead to ambiguities
that are exploited, causing actors to take insufficient measures to
ensure data protection and Data Subject’s rights.</p>
<p>As shown above, Solid’s role as a set of technical specifications
does not adequately cover all possible processing operations, which
makes it necessary to separate the processing of data within a Pod from
that which may occur outside the Pod. From a GDPR perspective, whether a
copy of the data exists outside the Pod, who has control over it and for
what purposes it is used are nevertheless important considerations
regarding responsibilities. However, full disclosure compels us to add
that the analysis below does not consider such situations where an actor
keeps a particular copy of the data in its own storage systems and
further processes that data for its own purposes as this already has
interpretations for GDPR. In our view, Pod Providers and Pod Users have
no possibility to determine the means, let alone the purposes, of
further processing performed on this data in those situations.
Therefore, an actor who transfers, copies, or stores personal data
elsewhere for their own purposes is considered a controller for these
processing activities. Keeping this in mind, the situation of using,
sharing, and transferring data outside Solid pods will not be further
analysed for identifying controllers within the Solid ecosystem.</p>
<h3>Initial collection of Data into the Pod</h3>
<p>Prior to managing personal data in a Pod, personal data must be
collected or generated by an actor to be subsequently stored in the Pod
(see Figure 2). This could be the Data Subject or a Pod User manually
uploading data, or a Data Provider, Third Party or an Application
writing it to the Pod. When an actor writes data into a Pod, it is not
solely in a position to determine the purpose of and means for further
processing operations of that data in the Pod. However, the actor can be
seen as a controller for the processing operation of collecting data
into the Pod.</p>
<p>Mechanisms such as use of undocumented formats, schemas, encryption,
or obfuscation techniques can be used by the actor to limit or prohibit
the further access and (re-)use of that data by other actors. Further,
actors such as Applications may store operational data required to
provide services within the Pod, and thus have legitimate reasons to
limit further access to that data. It should therefore be considered
that actors who employ such limitation methods are independently
determining the purposes and means of further processing by retaining
the ability to use that data whilst prohibiting others from doing the
same.[18] Therefore, in such cases the actor with factual control over
the ability to make effective use of that data should be considered the
controller for further processing operations. However, it is important
to note that as of now the Solid specifications do not provide a way to
classify or categorise such data as being functionally separate from the
other data stored in the Pod.[51]</p>
<p>Such practices, however, run directly counter to Solid’s goals of
providing data storage with access control to individuals. They
additionally prevent the reuse of data by other actors, thereby limiting
its interoperability and the value of the data. While the controller
responsibilities can be a deterrent for actors to not write data into
the Pod in an impeding way, interoperability obligations may also play a
role here if the data is meant to be provided to the Data Subject as
part of right to data portability (GDPR Art. 20) where data must be
provided in a format that allows reuse.[<a href="#fn64"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a>]
The Article 29 Data Protection Working Party even clarified in this
regard that not only the use of an interoperable data format is
important, but also the additional use of sufficient metadata to
preserve the meaning of the information exchanged.[64] Interoperability
obligations may potentially be tightened in the future in additional
legislation[<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a>] as they are part of the European
Union’s broader objective of encouraging interoperable and modular data
sharing. In doing so, the EU also seeks to control data-related services
that are now vertically integrated in the current market and thus could
be provided in a more interoperable and modular way (e.g. artificial
intelligence and analytics in the Digital Markets Act). The Data Act
also provides provisions to allow switching between interoperable cloud
services. Similarly, organisations that provide Solid Pods or establish
a data-sharing ecosystem based on Solid Pods, such as the Athumi
(Flemish data utility company), may begin to exclude providers from the
ecosystem when they identify such practices.</p>
<p>Without such clarity in data management within a Solid Pod, the
usefulness of Pods towards achieving its stated goals of empowering
individuals cannot be achieved as the effective control of data remains
with the Applications. The situation may end up becoming similar
to how smartphones – which are considered personal devices as the
individuals own them – have several applications but whose data cannot
be accessed nor used by the individuals who own the device and operate
it. Under GDPR, such smartphone device manufacturers [ref]
and applications [ref] may be considered
controllers when they have effective de-facto
control over the data and use it for their own purposes
even where such data is stored on systems owned by the data
subject. Similarly, we posit that for Solid, Applications which
have similar control over the management of data also qualify for being
controllers regardless of whether the user can or cannot access and
manage the same data.</p>
<h3>Storage of Data in the Pod</h3>
<p>To determine the purposes and means of processing for the way data is
stored, it is necessary to first understand the implementation of
storage within a Pod – for example, restrictions on what the Pod Users
can and cannot do regarding the Pod and data within a Pod similar to
cloud service models such as IaaS, PaaS and SaaS.</p>
<p>A Pod Provider purchasing infrastructure services often determines
the data accessibility, length of conservation as well as the operating,
updating, and configuring of the leased computer resources for e.g.,
security.[21,<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a>, 71] Still, an Infrastructure
Provider can impose specific storage or retrieval limitations. The
question then is to what extent this impacts the means of processing and
if it is sufficient to qualify as a joint controller with the Pod
Provider for the processing operation of storage. The concrete ability
of an Infrastructure Provider to protect the personal data of Data
Subjects and take (preventive) actions against possible breaches might
point towards a determination of the essential means. An indication here
may also be power asymmetries and the question of the extent to which
the contractual terms between the two actors can be freely determined
(implying that the Infrastructure Provider has more power than reflected
in the contract and goes beyond simply implementing the essential means
identified by the Pod Provider).[<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a>, 31] Authorities (such
as DPA’s in the EU) should keep an eye on these contractual terms in the
future. They may even publish guidelines for drafting such terms, just
as recommendations for the use of cloud services by the public sector
have been published in the past. Further, the Infrastructure Provider
can process data such as for telemetry without the Pod Provider’s
knowledge, which makes the Infrastructure Provider the controller for
processing of telemetry data.[49]</p>
<p>Furthermore, a similar reasoning can apply to a Pod Provider who
purchases platform services (for example in the form of an operating
system) in addition to infrastructure, but is restricted by the
conditions of the platform regarding the way in which data can be
stored. Depending on the concrete impact of such conditions, it will
become clear whether or not the platform has a factual influence on the
processing methods.[49, 67, <a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a>] In the past, case law
in this regard has indicated that jointly determining the purposes and
means of processing can even be done without written guidelines or
instructions from another actor, as organisational influence is
sufficient[25], as is compliance with certain policies of another
actor.[34]</p>
<p>Current broad interpretations of the concept of joint controller
hinder the predictability of the precise responsibilities in a Solid
ecosystem and ultimately complicate the effective implementation of the
GDPR in favour of privacy-enhancing technologies such as Solid Pods. On
the one hand, platforms having factual influences on the processing’s
purposes and means may take advantage of such ambiguities and pass on
their obligations to other actors through, for example, external
arrangements. On the other hand, the broad interpretation regarding
controllership that emerged in previous case law in order to protect and
empower Data Subjects can paradoxically have the opposite effect. For
example, broad interpretations of controllership combined with some form
of control over the storage of data in a Pod for Data Subjects through
permission mechanisms, may in some cases even suggest that Data Subjects
also have a say in determining the purposes and means of processing
(storage) with that data. In that respect, the use of Solid Pods may
have far-reaching implications for Data Subjects as additional
obligations under the GDPR can deter Data Subjects from using or
deploying their own Pod.</p>
<p>Specifically in IaaS and PaaS situations[<a href="#fn69"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a>],
where the Data Subject (as a Pod User and a Pod Provider at the same
time) purchases or rents cloud infrastructure or a certain platform,
that Data Subject manages the technical functionalities of operating a
Pod (the concrete software) itself. The question does arise whether the
Data Subject can become the controller for the storage operation of
their data within a Pod.[<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a>] In such cases, since
the Data Subject as a hypothetical controller would be storing only
their own data, we believe this question remains without broader
consequences as we would consider the Data Subject to know best how to
store their own data. The question becomes more interesting if the Pod
also contains information about their friends or family where it is
unclear how the GDPR should apply and who should be the controller to
protect the data protection rights of those friends and family. It is
not clear who is then responsible for concretely striking a balance
between those different interests, let alone how this can then be done.
Regulation can help, as can taking into account the interests of those
friends and family involved. In that regard, the concept of data
intermediary, introduced under the Data Governance Act, provides an
interesting avenue for further research into reconciling different
interests in such contexts.[6] Depending on the specifics of a
situation, the GDPR’s household exemption for processing personal data
in a purely personal or household setting could apply (GDPR Art. 2 (2)
(c)), meaning the Data Subject is exempt from the obligations of being a
controller. Two conditions must be fulfilled for the household exemption
to apply. Firstly, the dissemination of the data needs to be
restricted.[<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a>, <a href="#fn72"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a>]
Secondly, the processing of the data needs to stay within the private
setting.[71, <a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref73" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a>, <a href="#fn74"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74" role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a>,
<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a>] The household exemption is not
applicable whenever a Data Subject would carry out commercial, political
or charitable activities (which can be interpreted broadly).[<a
href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a>] In our view, whenever a Data
Subject (as a Pod User as well as a Pod Provider) stores data in the Pod
for purely personal use and does not share the data to an indefinite
number of people, the household exemption should apply.[<a href="#fn77"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a>]</p>
<p>Or to consider this in an alternative form, the GDPR enables data
subjects to avoid the responsibilities of a controller where they
process their own data by providing a ‘household exemption’ – but in
such cases if the Data Subject engages a processor then how should the
resulting relationship between data subject-controller and processor be
interpreted and what obligations should be fulfilled by whom is an
unanswered question. This has an important bearing on the cases where
Data Subjects manage their own Pods and where they may engage a
processor to provide additional resources (storage space, compute
capacity) or utilise Applications to manage their data (e.g. create a
local search index). In such cases, a pragmatic outcome would be that
the Data Subjects are not additionally burdened with the role of a
controller, yet are nevertheless afforded protection under the GDPR with
regard to the manner in which processors interact with their data.</p>
<p>Where Data Subjects as Pod Users receive a Pod maintained by a Pod
Provider (in this case a separate actor providing a consumer-oriented
product and thus SaaS situation) [66, 68, <a href="#fn78"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a>],
they have little or no influence on the technical processes by which
data is accessed, processed and transmitted, and which sub-processors
were engaged.[46] The Pod Provider implements the Solid specification
entirely as it sees fit and independently of the Pod User. The Pod
Provider in this case qualifies as the controller. However, where Pod
Providers use technologies from Third Parties to implement or supplement
implementations of the Solid specifications[18], these
Third Parties may also have an impact on the purposes and means of the
processing.[66] For example, software used by the Pod
Provider to manage storage or identity. The current broad interpretation
of the term joint controller may even lead to the Pod Provider being
classified as a joint controller with those Third Parties. In theory,
controllers such as the Pod Providers, should always be involved in
choosing the Third Parties that will process the data, e.g. by defining
it in external arrangements, therefore determining the purposes and
essential means of processing.[<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref79" role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a>] In practice, however,
this is not always the case and there may be power asymmetries again
exploiting the ambiguities in the broad case law regarding
controllership. Although the actual capacity to determine purposes and
means then lies with one actor, the associated responsibilities are
often shifted to the party with the least bargaining power as explained
under Section IV. Competent authorities should therefore also seek to
publish guidelines for the emerging technologies of identity providers
and other relevant resources, just as they have done in the past for the
use of cloud technology.[46] In this way, it becomes clear to Data
Subjects who the direct point of contact is (transparency) and the
principle of accountability can be ensured. The division of
responsibilities then also ideally follows the actual situation of
actual influence.</p>
<h3>Using Data in Solid Pods</h3>
<p>As already mentioned above, Solid’s permissions enable Pod Users to
selectively control which data can be accessed by which actor and for
which operation (read, write, modify, delete - see Figure 2). In this
respect, it is important to note that the Solid specification does not
currently provide the ability to express or record ’why’ the actor
requested or has access nor ’why’ the Pod User decided to provide it,
whereas GDPR in its article 13 and 30 expects records to be maintained
with purposes and legal bases. While Solid specifications do provide a
limited description to be associated with permissions, termed ‘Access
Need’, it does not suffice the legal requirements regarding clarity or
specificity of a purpose or a legal basis.[45] Mechanisms such as
notices and consent can be managed externally (e.g., by Third parties as
pointed out already) to meet GDPR’s requirements. However, since they
are not a part of the specification, we do not assume their existence as
a given since Solid specifications do not refer to them.</p>
<p>If Pod Users can determine via permissions who can process data in
the Pod, the question also arises whether the Pod User (assuming that he
is also the Data Subject) can be regarded as determining the purpose and
means for the processing of his personal data within the Pod. In our
opinion, Solid’s permissions are not sufficient to regard a Pod User as
a controller or joint controller for the processing operations related
to the ‘use’ of data. Currently, when a Pod User gains insight into the
specific purpose of the processing, the Pod User can only decide on
granting access or not, and likewise cannot counter-propose to these
purposes. However, Solid is marketed under the clear motto of Pod Users
having so-called “control” over the further processing operations of
their data. As a result, the contractual situation may again differ from
the actual situation, potentially shifting responsibilities under the
GDPR. Combined with the current broad interpretation of the concept of
(joint) controller, questions about possible implications of a
hypothetical situation in which a Pod User (as a Data Subject) qualifies
as a (joint) controller will increasingly arise.[<a href="#fn80"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a>]
In theory, a further evolution of Solid’s permissions could, for
example, allow Pod Users to select and limit the specific purposes their
data may be processed by actors. This could, given the broad
interpretation of the concept of (joint) controller, lead to situations
where actors such as Applications must depend on the Pod User to manage
and provide data. In these situations, the question may arise whether a
certain form of responsibility should be shared if it is limited, and
whether the household exemption is compatible with such situations.
Nevertheless, such implications would be contrary to the intention of
the GDPR and its protection of the Data Subject against the processing
of personal data that affects the exercise of fundamental rights.</p>
<p>Lastly, we also briefly discuss the situation in which actors using
data in the Pod, such as Applications, are not regarded as the sole
controllers for the further processing operations. Similar to Pod
Providers using Third Parties’ implementations, Applications can also
jointly determine the purposes and means of the processing with other
actors such as Infrastructure, Platform or Pod Providers. As already
mentioned above, such actors might still exert a factual influence on
the purposes and means of certain processing operations happening within
a Pod. The concrete ability of actors to protect the personal data of
data subjects and to take (preventive) measures against possible data
breaches plays a role. An indication of this, for example, is the
situation where certain Applications are not allowed on the Platform of
the Provider or where Platform or Pod Providers make use of a technology
of a Third Party and adjust the associated settings of that technology
in such a way that their own interests can be pursued (e.g., via a
Facebook like-button in Fashion ID). Moreover, practical implementations
might require Pod Providers to set up a processing layer that performs
aggregation or querying operations over the data in a Pod to supply the
Application with just the data it needs. In this way, Pod Providers
could also exert a factual influence on the essential means of
processing and qualify as controllers since they then determine in what
way and what data the Application gets to see. Again, we mention here
that the current broad jurisprudence regarding controllership allows for
ambiguities in situations with dispersed responsibilities. Ultimately,
responsibilities are then shifted to other actors which does not always
reflect reality in terms of actual impact on processing. Data Subjects
using PDS are then not empowered and protected at the same time.</p>
<h2>Further implications for Data Governance Act (DGA) and
development of AI and Data Spaces</h2>
<p>In light of the uncertainties and challenges associated with the use
of Solid Pods in accordance with the GDPR, it seems prudent to extend
similar inquiries to other forthcoming regulations and developments that
may impact the utilisation of Solid Pods. In order to achieve this, we
have selected the Data Governance Act (DGA)[6], which establishes a
legal framework for the reuse of personal data and non-personal data. It
is currently being implemented in various member states. Additionally,
we also explore the implications of Data Spaces and AI Act as
forthcoming regulations. All are of great importance to the ecosystem
involving Solid Pods, as the DGA inter alia foresees the establishment
of a decentralised system of entities designated as 'data
intermediaries', which can be responsible for the storage and management
of data as mentioned under article 10 of the DGA. In order to enhance
trust and transparency in data sharing, the EU has proposed the
introduction of neutral intermediaries with various obligations,
including the facilitation of data interoperability and reuse.
Furthermore, the DGA proposes the creation of a legal framework to
facilitate 'data altruism', a concept whereby for example Data Subjects
could donate their data for scientific research and other broad
purposes. Data altruism must be considered within the broader context of
data subject empowerment as it enables them to provide their data for an
altruistic purpose without the burden of risk assessment, which instead
is undertaken by data intermediaries. Similarly, in relation to AI, the
majority of companies are currently required to allocate a significant
proportion of their resources to the collection and management of data
for the purpose of training their models. The competition is occurring
in this context rather than in terms of the delivery of services and the
further development of the specific AI model itself. In order to
facilitate further advancement in the field of AI, it would be
beneficial to encourage innovation and competition beyond the domain of
data collection.[5] In this context, Solid Pods have the potential to
transform the availability and management of data.[<a href="#fn81"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a>]
This is because companies can access and utilise data directly from the
source (the Pod) rather than relying on their own internal collection
processes. Furthermore, in the field of Data Spaces, Solid can be viewed
as a catalyst for the technical implementation of Data Spaces. The
proposed and prominent IDSA Data Spaces protocol, for instance,
necessitates the deployment of established technologies and the
utilisation of interoperable standards.[<a href="#fn82"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a>][<a href="#fn83"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a>]
For instance, the IDSA considers the standards and architectural
principles established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which
serve as the foundation for the technical specifications of Solid.[<a
href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a>]</p>
<p>First focusing on the DGA, the connection to Solid should be apparent
as Solid Pods can be used under the DGA to manage access to data by both
Data Subjects (who want to provide the data), by data intermediaries
(who want to manage access over it), and data consumers (who want to use
it). Pods could thus be employed by data intermediaries to facilitate
data sharing between different parties by either providing such Pods to
the data subjects, or by taking on a custodial role in managing existing
Pods. It can be observed that intermediaries serve as an illustrative
example of a legally qualified entity capable of offering and using Pods
in a manner that seeks the benefits of data reuse without compromising
the data subject’s rights as defined under the DGA. In that regard, Pods
can also facilitate the collective management of data by, for example, a
data cooperative acting as an intermediary, thereby representing the
collective interests of a large number of data subjects.</p>
<p>Solid Pods provide a robust technical foundation for the automation
of permissions and access control mechanisms within the context of the
DGA. Furthermore, it provides a unified set of protocols that enable
requestors to access and manage data in a streamlined manner. Solid Pods
also provide a convenient means for organisations to enable individuals
to manage control over data generated by them without the burden of
managing the collection and storage themselves – for example government
departments, health organisations, and public services can store the
individual’s personal data on Solid Pods (as is done by Athumi in
Flanders, Belgium) and let the individuals decide when and with whom
they want to share this data. The DGA also introduces the concept of
data altruism whereby individuals can ‘donate’ their data for public
benefit purposes. Solid Pods can serve as a way to automate these
engagements and provide individuals with control mechanisms over their
data. Moreover, data in Solid Pods are stored in a format that follows
the principles of Linked Data, which immediately facilitates the
comprehension of the context, business logic, and implicit assumptions
associated with the data. In this context, the interoperability
obligations of data intermediaries under article 12 of the DGA can
result in Pod Providers, which may be considered data intermediaries,
assuming a significant role with regard to the maintenance and
availability of Linked Data within the Pod. Solid thus creates a
tempting technological solution to the vision of the DGA.</p>
<p>However, as we highlighted in this article, Solid in its current form
has severe challenges when it comes to the GDPR due to the lack of
interpretation in roles and responsibilities from the legal side, as
well as a lack of sufficient technical safeguards and mechanisms to
support the legal obligations. We posit that similar (technical)
challenges exist for the use of Solid under the DGA, first because the
DGA itself relies on the GDPR for the regulation of processing personal
data, and second because the DGA introduces new obligations akin to
‘duty of care’ on data intermediaries that go beyond the requirements of
GDPR when it comes to controllers. For example, under the DGA, the data
intermediary must support the data subjects in making consenting
decisions regarding the use of their personal data – for which the
intermediary must first perform a risk assessment in order to identify
the benefits and risks associated with proposed processing. The
necessary information to do such an assessment is currently not
supported by Solid, and therefore it must be obtained and used external
to the Pod – which is technologically ineffective and runs the risk of
having the same existing problems such as dark patterns and misuses of
information. A further issue is the lack of clarity surrounding the
precise delineation of the definition of a data intermediary.[<a
href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a>] This impedes the identification of
the specific entities that are responsible for implementing data
interoperability obligations. As a result, the potential of Linked Data
in Pods remains unexploited. In light of the forthcoming DGA
implementations and the anticipated establishment of guidelines on the
interpretation and enforcement of the DGA, we underscore the necessity
for further clarity regarding the definition of a data intermediary as
well as the incorporation of technological solutions, akin to those
observed in the PDS, to facilitate the fulfilment of regulatory
requirements.</p>
<p>Second – as Solid Pods by definition are intended for data storage
and management, and most commonly will involve personal data, it is
envisioned that actors will want to utilise this data for providing AI
services – whether beneficial such as personalised recommendations
and conversational agents, or for nefarious purposes such as
surveillance profiling. Similarly, in light of the EU's objective
of establishing a novel data sharing ecosystem through Data Spaces, the
management and availability of data while simultaneously protecting and
empowering Data Subjects through for example Solid Pods becomes an even
more crucial and tangible concern. From the perspective of the GDPR, the
ambiguities regarding the interpretation of roles and responsibilities,
as well as the lack of sufficient technical mechanisms to support legal
obligations, present significant challenges to the envisioned
transformation in the availability and management of data. This impedes
the new focus on the advancement of new services, thereby constraining
the full potential of AI developments and services for data spaces.</p>
<p>In terms of technical mechanisms, the inability to control whether
data stored in Solid Pod can be used for specific 'purposes' such as
training an AI systems leaves Applications with only the need of a
permission to "use" AI as currently defined in Solid specifications to
access and use this data. A case in point is the recent announcement by
Meta that it will commence using posts from users to train its AI
services, which was immediately met with complaints alleging
infringement of GDPR and rights [ref]. This action was possible only
because Meta currently hosts all this data. In a decentralised system
such as that utilising Solid, Meta does not host the data itself, but
rather utilises it from the user's Pod. As it has already been granted
access to the data in order to provide its services, it is able to start
using this data for training purposes without any changes being made to
the way in which it accesses the data. In contrast, if Solid Pods were
to employ a purpose-based access control system, Meta would be required
to declare its intention to utilise the data for a new purpose, thereby
triggering a new set of permission requests to the user. This approach
aligns with the principles of protection and empowerment inherent to
Solid, while still facilitating data availability and up-to-date
management. In addition, it also facilitates a ‘compliance-by-design’
approach to the GDPR where purpose separation is a necessary legal
obligation such as for consent.</p>
<p>In view of the legal uncertainties, it is worth noting that a
'fundamental rights impact assessment'[<a href="#fn86"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a>]
is a mandatory requirement for certain uses of an AI system that is
categorised as ‘high-risk’, as stipulated by the AI Act article 27[<a
href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a>]. Similarly, the AI Act also
establishes requirements for risk management (article 9), automatically
maintaining logs (article 12), and transparency requirements (article
13) which result in obligations on entities classified as ‘deployers’
and ‘providers’ of AI systems. In the case of Solid Pods, the
applicability of the AI Act depends on the manner in which AI is being
used and whether it falls into one of the high-risk categories defined
in the AI Act. Though like GDPR, the AI Act also defines a ‘personal
exemption’ (recital 13), it is similarly unclear about how individuals
using AI in a personal capacity can benefit from the obligations of the
AI Act on actors providing services. It is therefore essential to
consider the capabilities and limitations of data and its use by AI
systems, for example via Solid Pods, in order to understand the risks
and impacts involved.</p>
<p>In light of the potential for overlap with the conducting of a Data
Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), the AI Act explicitly acknowledges
the possibility to reuse a DPIA to conduct a Fundamental Rights Impact
Assessment (FRIA) (article 27). Given that AI development involves
multiple actors in the lifecycle, this is a way for one actor to provide
another with risk assessment information – or a DPIA – to support the
other actors in conducting their own risk assessments in the context of
use or deployment. Under GDPR, it would appear that the party fulfilling
the role of data controller in this context is best placed to undertake
this task.[<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a>, <a href="#fn89"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a>]
If the role of data controller is unclear, as we have shown is the case
for Solid Pods, as a result, the uncertainty surrounding the division of
responsibilities as set forth in the GDPR also has a further impact on
the implementation of provisions potentially protecting Data Subjects
under the AI Act. To avoid Data Subjects having to manage their own AI
risks, and so that they are protected from any harmful or misuses of AI,
we encourage a similar investigation be made into the use of AI in Solid
Pods based on the assessment of technical capabilities with assignment
of legal responsibilities that we have shown in this article.</p>
<h2>Concluding Remarks and Recommendations</h2>
<p>The present article focuses on the issue of the division of
responsibilities and, in particular, on the designation of
controllership under GDPR with regard to decentralised data governance
systems. Indeed, a precise delineation of responsibilities guarantees
that Data Subjects can be simultaneously protected and granted control
over the storage and management of data in a leading personal data store
(PDS) solution such as Solid. Moreover, the technical specifications on
which Solid is based can also provide mechanisms to automate the
fulfilment of legal obligations, thereby potentially facilitating a
transformation in the availability and management of data, which is
beneficial to Data Spaces and the further development of AI. This
article therefore presents a case for implementing PDS in the form of
Solid within the current regulatory landscape from a multidisciplinary
perspective. Subsequently, the potential implications of such an
implementation are considered in relation to forthcoming developments,
including Data Spaces and AI, and to the introduction of new legislative
measures, such as the DGA. Due to the broad interpretation of what
determines who should be a controller as well as the flexibility and
diversity with which Pods are set up and Solid specifications are
implemented, a multitude of actors in the Solid ecosystem may qualify as
controllers. Furthermore, modern data-driven supply chains are
increasingly comprised of services provided in a modular fashion, which
makes the flexibility and diversity even greater. This raises several
issues as well as further questions to be explored in future research.
It is only through a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the
technological and legal landscape by policymakers that the necessary
efforts to evolve the interpretation of regulations such as the GDPR
towards a decentralised and individual-empowering paradigm can be made.
In the absence of these efforts, there is a risk of inadequate
protection and empowerment, as responsibilities remain ambiguous, both
in legal terms and in the context of technical implementations. The
article thus concludes with a series of recommendations pertaining to
the clarification of the delineation of responsibilities, which are also
intended to underscore forthcoming developments and recent legislative
changes. While the article suggests avenues for further research, it
does not present a definitive solution to the full range of issues
raised in this context. It can be concluded, therefore, that the
protection and empowerment of stakeholders in the deployment of PDS
represents an ongoing process.</p>
<p>One issue with this broad interpretation is the ‘pulverization of
control’.[71] Already in Fashion ID, the Advocate General
wondered whether effective data protection can be enhanced if everyone
is made responsible for ensuring it (ultimately meaning no one will in
fact be responsible).[<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a>] Legal certainty consequently
impacts the proper functioning of an economic market. Different actors
who want to offer a market commodity, such as a Pod, must be able to
assess what obligations they must meet when they enter the market. If it
is not exactly clear who within the Solid-based ecosystem is responsible
for legally mandated obligations, it will hinder innovation and progress
of the ecosystem. For instance, in view of the possibility of overlap
between the conduct of a DPIA and a fundamental rights impact assessment
under the AI Act, it would seem that the party assuming the role of data
controller in this context is best positioned to undertake this task.
Consequently, the uncertainty surrounding the division of
responsibilities also has an impact on the implementation of provisions
potentially protecting Data Subjects under the AI Act. Moreover, in the
absence of clarity regarding the division of responsibilities, actors
such as providers of Pods and Applications may be encouraged to design a
system so as to give some control to the ‘accidental’ controllers. For
example, these include Pod Providers purchasing a particular
infrastructure or platform or even Pod Users purchasing software they
have no real knowledge of, let alone the ability to make changes to
it.[25] Exploited legal ambiguities hinder Data Subjects’ right to data
protection as the parties who have the concrete ability to protect the
personal data of Data Subjects and to take (preventive) measures against
possible data breaches can avoid their responsibilities. The first
crucial step towards a solution for these problems could be formulating
explicit contractual terms and regulatory guidance that indicates the
specific roles and obligations associated with each actor in such an
ecosystem. Authorities (such as DPA’s) have already stressed the need
for contractual terms for cloud services. Furthermore, subject to
appropriate future research-based guidance, the market can draft and
standardise “model contracts” for different Solid ecosystem requirements
and use cases such as Data Spaces. In that regard, we could also ask
whether Applications and actors that ensure the practical implementation
of certain model contracts or standards could not be merged at a higher
level into a common "EU App Store". This EU App Store would then reflect
Applications and other actors that respect European data protection
values. The advantages and disadvantages of such an EU App Store could
be weighed against each other in future research. In a similar vein, the
Flemish government already fulfils the role of gatekeeper through a
limited liability company that monitors and records contracts before
Applications are allowed to access citizens' Pods (issued by Flemish
government).[<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a>] Furthermore, in addition to
fulfilling the obligations set forth in the DGA, Pod Providers that
qualify as data intermediaries are granted a label upon demonstrating
compliance with the aforementioned obligations. These obligations
encompass, but are not limited to, the necessity to act in the best
interests of Data Subjects. In this context, the competent authorities
under the DGA may encourage Pod Providers qualifying as data
intermediaries to engage exclusively with Applications and other actors
that follow established model contracts. Secondly, as the current
literature suggests, it may also be advisable to narrow the scope of the
controllership and to impose a higher threshold for the level of
influence over processing means. This could be combined with tighter
obligations on data processors, for instance with regard to data
protection by design.[66]</p>
<p>A further issue with the concept of controllership as currently
defined in CJEU rulings is that it could, in theory, result in Pod
Users, as natural persons and thus Data Subjects, being designated as
controllers themselves. This would have the effect of undermining the
initial purpose of the data protection regulation and the uptake of
Solid Pods, which are supposed to facilitate an enhanced availability
and management of data. As no effective study has yet been conducted on
what this might mean in practice for Data Subjects and their possible
new types of responsibilities, this is a risky hypothesis to make.
Complying with these obligations could imply a conflict between Data
Subjects having certain rights as a Data Subject and their obligations
and duties as a controller.[71, 74] The consequence of the development
of broad interpretations of controllership in jurisprudence, to protect
the Data Subject, is thus paradoxically a danger to Data Subjects in
this context of privacy-enhancing technologies such as Pods. Even if
Data Subjects are acting in good faith and doing their best, there is no
certainty about their legal responsibilities, specifically in case they
manage data of other natural persons in their Pod.[<a href="#fn92"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92" role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a>]
A widening of or an exemption similar to the household exemption when
having access control over data processed in a Pod, may be a first step
to relieve this tension. Further, making it more explicit about how
different interests can be reconciled (e.g., one Data Subject vs. other
natural persons) could make it easier for Data Subjects to manage data
of other natural persons in their Pod. In that regard, the
decentralisation paradigm of Solid is also attractive in considering
potential data intermediaries under the Data Governance Act as potential
resolvers of such conflicts in the Solid ecosystem. Nevertheless,
additional research into economically viable business models for such
data intermediaries is recommended.[<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref93" role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a>] In addition, one may
wonder whether this would also mean that Data Subjects bear no
responsibility at all when they make use of Pods, specifically when
their Pod also contains personal data of other natural persons.[<a
href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a>] Possibly natural persons as Pod
Users in this situation can only be identified as data controllers in a
way that subjects them to new kinds of minimum obligations that do not
compromise their rights as Data Subjects. We therefore conclude with a
call for further research and regulatory guidance regarding these
emerging questions in order to protect as well as empower Data Subjects
using PDS. In view of the considerable emphasis placed on data
sovereignty and the forms of control exercised over subsequent data
usage in Data Spaces, this call becomes increasingly tangible and
relevant.</p>
<p>Regardless of regulatory guidance and technical mechanisms to
automate the fulfilment of legal obligations, data protection literacy
of the actors in the Solid ecosystem also plays a vital role in
protecting and empowering Data Subjects using PDS. For example, Pod
Providers require guidance on auditing infrastructure, resource
providers, and Third Parties utilised in their solutions to have a clear
overview of how, where, and by whom the data is being processed - and to
understand the distribution of GDPR’s obligations and liabilities.
Similarly, Pod Users (and Data Subjects) should be provided with
effective data protection literacy to better understand rights and
perhaps even obligations based on the specific infrastructure and
governance of their Pods (e.g., self-managed Pod or provided as SaaS by
a Pod Provider) when containing data of other natural persons. With
regard to the DGA, further guidance could be provided towards data
intermediaries regarding the availability of data as Linked Data. This
would enhance the value and knowledge extraction from the data, as well
as the potential to implement technical mechanisms in line with current
regulations in the Pod.</p>
<p>Lastly, at the technical level, some suggestions can also be made to
ultimately achieve the objective of simultaneously protecting and
empowering Data Subjects using PDS. It is evident that, in the absence
of additional technical measures to oversee the usage of data within
Solid Pods for particular 'purposes' in accordance with the GDPR, an
Application is only obliged to obtain 'permission' in accordance with
the current, less far-reaching, Solid specifications to access and make
use of the data. These Solid specifications lack effective mechanisms
(logging or data provenance mechanisms in combination with
permission-based system) to support oversight of how, where, and by whom
the data is being processed. In relation to the DGA, the data
intermediary bears the responsibility of assisting data subjects in
making informed consent decisions regarding the use of their personal
data. Furthermore, they are obliged to conduct a risk assessment in
order to identify the potential benefits and risks associated with the
proposed processing. Nevertheless, the lack of technical mechanisms to
oversee the processing renders the performance of such an assessment in
a Solid ecosystem currently too complex and onerous. As a potential
solution, a Pod should provide the necessary technical measures to track
data transactions and allow Pod Users or auditors to inspect ongoing
processing activities and apply access controls where required. While we
have focused on the specifics of Solid and its permission-based system
in our analysis, actors such as Applications can also rely on existing
modalities such as consent dialogues and privacy policies on their
websites to comply with their responsibilities as a controller under the
GDPR. However, while we acknowledge the potential legality of such
approaches, we also point towards the well-established misuse and abuse
of these mechanisms to make it more difficult for individuals to
understand and control access over their personal data, as well as to
the unbridled surveillance and profiling. We therefore consider Solid’s
mission to also extend towards creating better mechanisms that overcome
such known issues and truly provide individuals with transparency and
accountability as enshrined in the GDPR. This should be done at the
specification level, to establish and enforce desired practices and good
forms of governance. The potential for such exemplary models of
governance can be drawn from developments within the field of Data
Spaces. These concepts could be further discussed within organisations
that are striving for a more consistent and comprehensive implementation
of Data Spaces, such as the Data Spaces Support Centre.[<a href="#fn95"

ensure the applicability of such exemption<a href="#fnref73"
