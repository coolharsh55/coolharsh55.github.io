<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The EU GDPR is a landmark regulation that introduced several rights for individuals to obtain information and control how their personal data is being processed, as well as receive a copy of it. However, there are gaps in the effective use of rights due to each organisation developing custom methods for rights declaration and management.
Simultaneously, there is a technological gap as there is no single consistent standards-based mechanism that can automate the handling of rights for both organisations and individuals.
In this article, we present a specification for exercising and managing rights in a machine-interpretable format based on semantic web standards.
Our approach uses the comprehensive Data Privacy Vocabulary to create a streamlined workflow for individuals to understand what rights exist, how and where to exercise them, and for organisations to effectively manage them.
This work pushes the state of the art in GDPR rights management and is crucial for data reuse and rights management under technologically intensive developments, such as Data Spaces.</p>

<h2 id="sec:intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <span class="citation"
data-cites="gdpr"><a href="#ref-gdpr"
role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span> grants data subjects a set of rights
designed to protect their personal data and to ensure that they have
greater control over how their data is collected, processed, and used by
organisations. These rights include the right to access personal data,
the right to rectification of inaccurate data, the right to erasure
(commonly known as the “right to be forgotten”), and the right to data
portability, which allows individuals to ask for their data to be
transferred between data controllers. Additionally, the GDPR provides
rights to restrict processing, object to data use, and avoid automated
decision-making. These rights, combined with the transparency and
accountability measures imposed on organisations, aim to strike a
balance between the interests of data subjects and the legitimate needs
of businesses and institutions in the digital age. However, despite the
comprehensive rights granted to individuals under regulations such as
the GDPR, a ‘technological gap’, i.e., a significant lack of efficient
tools, for exercising these rights remains <span class="citation"
data-cites="bernes_enhancing_2022"><a href="#ref-bernes_enhancing_2022"
role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span>. Many organisations struggle to
provide accessible, user-friendly mechanisms for individuals to manage
their personal data, often relying on cumbersome manual processes, which
can lead to delays, or even non-compliance. For data subjects, the
process of requesting access, rectification, or deletion of their data
can be time-consuming, unclear, and inconsistent across different
platforms. Additionally, there is a lack of standardisation in how
organisations handle these requests, further complicating the process.
Without more automated and streamlined tools, individuals face
unnecessary barriers to effectively controlling their data, undermining
the intent of regulations designed to empower them.</p>
<p>In this context, we present a specification to express information
regarding rights exercise and management in a machine-interpretable
format, using semantic Web standards such as RDF. In doing so, we begin
to address the automation, interoperability and standardisation
challenges identified above, towards enabling the development of tools
for assisting individuals and organisations in right exercising
activities. Towards achieving this goal, we reuse and extend the Data
Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) <span class="citation"
data-cites="panditCreatingVocabularyData2019 pandit2024dpv"><a
href="#ref-panditCreatingVocabularyData2019"
role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a>, <a href="#ref-pandit2024dpv"
role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span>, which allows the expression of
information related to legislative requirements such as the GDPR. The
developed extension provides a taxonomy to enable representing
justifications associated with the non-fulfilment, non-requirement,
delays, and exercising of processes, including rights exercising. Beyond
DPV, the contributions in this article also promote the usage of the
Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) <span class="citation"

ontologies to express information about: (1) Linking personal data
processing activities to applicable rights, (2) Providing notices
related to said rights, (3) Documenting the exercise of rights, and (4)
GDPR rights requests. The resulting specification is being developed in
the context of the W3C Data Privacy Vocabularies and Controls Community
Group (DPVCG).</p>
<p>The remaining of the article is structured as follows: Section <a
href="#sec:sota" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:sota">2</a> provides background information on
GDPR’s data subject rights and existing semantic technologies for rights
management, Section <a href="#sec:rights" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:rights">3</a> presents the developed specification
to express applicable rights, notices, records of activities and rights
requests, and Section <a href="#sec:conclusions"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:conclusions">4</a>
concludes and presents future directions of work.</p>
<h2 id="sec:sota">Background and State of the Art</h2>
<p>GDPR’s data subject rights are provided on Chapter III, with Articles
12 and 23 listing requirements for and exceptions to the exercising of
rights, respectively, and with Articles 13 to 22 concretely defining
them. Rights can be passive, i.e., no action needed from the data
subject for them to be applicable, or active, i.e., need to be actively
requested by the data subject. Nonetheless, in both cases, they involve
the flow of information between a data subject and a data controller.
After confirming receipt of the data subject’s request, the controller
must verify the identity of the data subject before proceeding with the
request. If the controller is unable to identify the data subject,
additional information must be provided by the data subject to enable
identification. If the controller has a valid justification for not
fulfilling the right, the data subject must be informed of such
justification. In cases where the request is complex or there are a
large number of requests, the controller is granted a 2-month extension
to fulfill the request. Additionally, if the request is deemed unfounded
or excessive, the controller may charge a fee, and the data subject will
only receive the requested information once this fee is paid. If the
controller fails to meet its obligations at any point, a GDPR breach
occurs. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) also endorsed and
issued guidelines to assist on data subject rights <span

role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a>–<a
href="#ref-sis_ii_supervision_coordination_group_schengen_2023"
role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></span>.</p>
<p>Even though the existence of these rights has been brought forward
has a huge step for individuals empowerment over their personal data, no
standards have been defined for the management of information related to
rights exercising. An exception to this statement might be the ‘Data
Rights Protocol’<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, developed by Consumer Reports
Innovation Lab<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, which “defines a web protocol
encoding a set of standardized request/response data flows such that
Users can exercise Personal Data Rights provided under regulations like
the California Consumer Privacy Act, General Data Protection Regulation,
and other regulatory or voluntary bases, and receive affirmative
responses in standardized formats”<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. It does not however
cover all GDPR rights and does not promote the usage of standard
vocabularies to record information about rights being exercised. Since
semantic technologies promote interoperability, allowing information and
its interpretability to be consistently defined across different
platforms, improving the discoverability, management, and preservation
of resources, we will promote the usage of semantic Web standards for
the definition of a specification to express rights exercisement and
management. As such, DPV<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a><span class="citation"
data-cites="panditCreatingVocabularyData2019 pandit2024dpv"><a

role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span> is the main driver of the
specification presented in this work, as it is the most comprehensive
data protection-related vocabulary, providing a set of taxonomies for
the expression of metadata related to the usage of personal data aligned
with legal requirements, e.g., the GDPR. Additionally, the usage of
ODRL<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"

is also reused.</p>
<h2 id="sec:rights">Rights Exercise and Management</h2>
<p>Based on the GDPR provisions for data subject rights identified in
Section <a href="#sec:sota" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:sota">2</a>, the following requirements are
addressed in the proposed specification:</p>
<div class="inlineabc">
<p>information about the existence of rights related to personal data
processing activities,</p>
<p>justifications for the exercising of said rights,</p>
<p>notices related to the fulfilment or non-fulfilment of rights,</p>
<p>records of rights-related activities, and</p>
<p>GDPR-related rights requests as machine-executable policies.</p>
</div>
<p>The work is publicly available<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> and includes examples
for each requirement identified above, which are omitted from this
article due to size restrictions.</p>
<h3 id="sec:applicable-rights">Applicable Data Subject Rights</h3>
<p>Beyond jurisdiction-dependence, applicable data subject rights also
depend on the legal ground used to process personal data. In the case of
the GDPR, DPV’s GDPR extension<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> contains the terms to
represent the rights available under GDPR, as well as a mapping of which
rights are applicable based on the used legal basis. As such, apart from
detailing information about what personal data is being processed, how,
where, by whom, and for what purpose, a <code>dpv:Process</code> can
also be used to indicate applicable rights. Data controllers can use
this approach to express which rights apply, including those beyond
GDPR, such as the EU’s fundamental rights and rights outlined in other
EU regulations or jurisdictions, i.e., the <code>dpv:hasScope</code>
property can be used to indicate applicable rights by jurisdiction.
Listing <a href="#lst:rights" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="lst:rights">[lst:rights]</a> highlights the modeling of
a personal data process using DPV, where <code>dpv:hasScope</code> is
used to express existing rights under EU’s GDPR when data is processed
based on consent and its similar UK-based counterpart.</p>

<h3 id="sec:justifications">Justifications for the exercising of
rights</h3>
<p>As a result of the collection of requirements for GDPR rights
exercising, a <code>Justification</code> taxonomy<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>,
to provide reasons or explanations related to the fulfilment,
non-fulfilment, delay and exercise of rights, was developed. Examples of
justifications include individual’s identity not being verifiable or a
request being considered overly excessive or burdensome. Justifications
can also explain why certain processes are necessary or being delayed,
such as the ground to exercise the right to object or requiring
additional information to move forward with a process. To facilitate the
expression of these detailed justifications, this extension introduces
concepts that extend DPV’s <code>Justification</code> concept. Moreover,
since such concepts can be reused for other data protection-related
activities, e.g., data breach reports, the concepts were defined in a
generic way so that they can be reused in distinct contexts.</p>
<h3 id="sec:notices">Notices related to the fulfilment or non-fulfilment
of rights</h3>
<p>Right exercise notices should inform data subjects about where and
how to exercise an active right, what information is needed, or provide
updates on a submitted right request. DPV’s <code>isExercisedAt</code>
property can be used to link rights to specific exercise points, such as
through right exercise notices, and to connect the required information
with a process using DPV’s <code>hasProcess</code> property. DPV’s
<code>hasRecipient</code>, <code>hasStatus</code>, and
<code>hasJustification</code> properties can be employed to update the
data subject on the status of their right exercising activity, including
any justification for why the right is being exercised. In addition to
the properties mentioned earlier, DCMI’s concepts can be reused to
indicate temporal and other metadata information related to notices.
Table <a href="#tab:dcterms" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:dcterms">1</a> summarises the terms reused from DCMI
throughout this specification. The notices should also provide
information about the data controller, as well as the entity responsible
for implementing the notice. This could be the data controller or
another entity acting on their behalf, represented using
<code>dpv:hasDataController</code> and
<code>dpv:isImplementedByEntity</code>, respectively. Additionally,
<code>foaf:page</code><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> can be used to reference a
document, such as a Webpage, that contains the full details of the
notice and offers further functionalities.</p>

</div>
<p>Notices specifically informing about the fulfilment, progress toward
fulfilment, or non-fulfilment of a right can also be modelled with DPV.
Actions required by entities to fulfil a rights-related request, which
cannot be fully detailed using DPV– such as issuing payment terms –can
be attached to these notices, e.g., using ODRL policies. Listing <a
href="#lst:notice" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="lst:notice">[lst:notice]</a> provides an example of a
non-fulfilment notice, where the request will be unfulfilled, since it
would interfere with the right of freedom of expression and information
of others, as indicated by the <code>FreedomOfExpressionImpaired</code>
justification. For GDPR-specific notices, DPV’s GDPR extension offers
concepts for both direct and indirect data collection notices, as
required by Articles 13 and 14, respectively, and it also includes
Subject Access Request (SAR) notices to fulfil the GDPR Right of Access,
and recipient notices to meet the notification requirements of Article
19.</p>

<h3 id="sec:records">Records of rights-related activities</h3>
<p>Recording provenance information when a specific instance of a right
has been or is being exercised is valuable for data controllers, as it
provides machine-readable information about the status and fulfilment of
requests, which can be useful for auditors, among others. To represent
specific records of rights being exercised, DPV’s
<code>RightExerciseRecord</code> can be used to link a particular
request, or multiple requests from the same data subject, with the
corresponding activities, i.e., <code>dpv:RightExerciseActivity</code>,
carried out by entities to fulfil those requests. Right exercise records
can also leverage the DCAT standard for representing data catalogues. A
right exercise record can be modelled as a <code>dcat:Catalog</code>,
with right exercise activities represented as
<code>dcat:Resource</code>, which can be grouped and organised using
<code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code>. This approach offers the advantage of
utilising DCAT’s ordering properties, such as <code>dcat:first</code>,
<code>dcat:last</code>, and <code>dcat:prev</code>, to easily track and
retrieve the most recent activity related to a specific rights-related
request. Listing <a href="#lst:record" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="lst:record">[lst:record]</a> provides an example of a
right exercise record maintained by a data controller for all the
rights-related requests of a particular data subject. A catalogue
record, i.e., <code>dcat:CatalogRecord</code>, is maintained to capture
metadata about the right exercise record, including details about the
data controller and the data subject. In the example, the data subject
has initiated two requests, <code>ex:request-001</code> and
<code>ex:request-002</code>. The right exercising activities related to
these requests are grouped and organised in
<code>ex:request-001-series</code> and
<code>ex:request-002-series</code>, respectively. Using the
<code>dcat:last</code> property, the most recent activity for each
request can be easily retrieved.</p>

</div>
<p>In this context, a <code>dpv:RightExerciseActivity</code> represents
a specific instance of an activity carried out in the process of
exercising a right. These activity instances should include metadata,
such as timestamps, duration, and involved entities, to track the
provenance of the right exercising process – from the initial request to
its acknowledgement by the data controller, and ultimately to the
fulfilment or non-fulfilment of the right. To track the status of rights
exercising activities, DPV provides <code>RequestStatus</code> concepts,
such as <code>RequestAccepted</code> for accepted requests moving toward
fulfilment or <code>RequestRequiresAction</code> for requests requiring
further action from another party. Figure <a href="#fig:status"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:status">1</a> illustrates
the lifecycle of these concepts. Once a request is initiated, it should
be acknowledged by the responsible entity and either accepted for
fulfilment or rejected. If rejected, the entity may require additional
actions from the requester (e.g., providing more information to
proceed), which can delay the acceptance or rejection. After the
required action is taken, the request may either be accepted for
fulfilment, rejected again, or further action may be requested.</p>
<figure id="fig:status">

</figure>
<p>Moreover, DPV concepts can be combined with the W3C’s PROV-O
recommendation to track the provenance of a right exercising activity
instance. This allows for the representation of provenance details, such
as the entities involved in the activity, i.e.,
<code>prov:wasAssociatedWith</code>, or the data/notice generated by the
activity, i.e., <code>prov:generated</code>. The
<code>prov:actedOnBehalfOf</code> property can also be used to represent
delegation or representation, for example, when a parent exercises a
right on behalf of a child. Listing <a href="#lst:activity"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="lst:activity">[lst:activity]</a> provides an example of
an activity where the data controller requires further action from the
data subject to be able to proceed with the request. The required action
is defined using a <code>dpv:Process</code>. Examples for the whole
lifecycle of activities are provided in the proposed specification.
Furthermore, the proposed model for right exercising activities is
generic enough to support the representation of rights from other
jurisdictions and can be easily extended if the need arises.</p>

<h3 id="sec:policies">GDPR-related rights requests as machine-executable
policies</h3>
<p>DPV and ODRL can also be used for data subjects to send GDPR-related
right requests in a machine-interpretable format to data controllers.
Such requests can then be integrated in their rights management
processes to for automated execution of responses to data subjects’
requests. For example, systems that use an ODRL evaluator based on the
formal semantics of ODRL <span class="citation"
data-cites="fornara_odrl_2024"><a href="#ref-fornara_odrl_2024"
role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a></span> can assess policies to determine
which ones are active, have been violated, or have been fulfilled, to
respond consistently and interoperably to rights-related requests. As
such, GDPR’s data subject rights described in Articles 15 to 22 can be
instantiated as ODRL policies containing permissions, prohibitions and
obligations to data controllers to act upon or fulfil. Generic policies
for each right are available in the proposed specification. Listing <a
href="#lst:policy" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="lst:policy">[lst:policy]</a> provides an example of a
request to exercise GDPR’s right to erasure. It can be represented as an
obligation to delete a data subject’s personal data based on one of the
grounds specified in Article 17.1. These grounds can be detailed using
DPV’s justifications, e.g., the data is no longer necessary in relation
to the purposes for which it was
processed –<code>justifications:NonNecessityObjection</code>.
Additionally, Article 19 requires that if the data has been shared with
recipients, the data controller must inform the data subject about these
recipients.</p>

<h2 id="sec:conclusions">Conclusions and Future Work</h2>
<p>This article provides a machine-interpretable and executable model to
represent information regarding data subject rights, concepts to justify
their fulfilment or non-fulfilment, notices to communicate about them
with other entities, records for auditing and policies for automated
execution of responses to rights requests based on the GDPR. Through
these, we hope to enable related tools and processes to handle
obligations related to rights in an interoperable manner.</p>
<p>We believe our proposal provides a crucially missing technological
piece that is required to make effective use of GDPR rights across
different services and devices that utilise the Web. The Data Privacy
Vocabulary (DPV), which is a central component of our rights management
specification, is a comprehensive and growing resource that is being
actively developed, has been used by industry and academic projects, and
involves inputs from a diverse range of stakeholders. More importantly,
the development of DPV – and the rights management concepts presented
here – involves engagement with legal experts who validate its use as
per legal requirements under GDPR, and discussions with Data Protection
Officers<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> and implement legal compliance
platforms<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> who provide practical grounding for
ensuring this work is effective.</p>
<p>To realise the potential of our work, it is important for the rights
management specification to be seen as <em>useful</em> and
<em>effective</em> by organisations and legal authorities so as to
enable its uptake. To enable its technical adoption, one option is to
integrate this work with protocols such as the Data Rights Protocol
which creates a single consistent technical signalling mechanism for
rights management on the Web. Another option is to utilise existing
EU-friendly mechanisms such as the Advanced Data Protection Control<a
href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> (ADPC), which have rights
management in their scope but lack the technical implementation – which
this work can provide.</p>
<p>Finally, we highlight the importance of this work in developing
ecosystems based on the Data Governance Act (DGA), Data Act, and the
Data Spaces regulations, where data reuse will be based on technical
infrastructures. Additionally, the EU Commission has launched an
ambitious program<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> consisting of creating a secure
European Digital Identity wallet (EUDI) which will be used by
individuals and organisations to assert their identity and access
public/private services based on personal data stored in the wallets.
While work on how to store and manage consent in such wallets based on
standards has already been explored <span class="citation"
data-cites="pandit2024implementing"><a
href="#ref-pandit2024implementing" role="doc-biblioref">[13]</a></span>,
the question of how such wallets can facilitate rights exercise has not
been explored. The work presented in this article provides the technical
basis for creating a GDPR-compliant by design rights management
infrastructure that Data Spaces or EUDI wallets can utilise for
individuals and organisations to exercise and manage rights in a
consistent standardised and interoperable manner. This not only
facilitates GDPR compliance, but also creates a streamlined experience
for users and promotes transparency and accountability.</p>
