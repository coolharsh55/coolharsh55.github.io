            <section>
    <p>My website was previously hosted on a t2.micro <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">AWS EC2</a>
        instance, which was good enough to host the website and do other basic
        things like run an API or a database, or even some background jobs.
        At the start, the instance was free to run because I had a lot of free
        credits - obtained from events, competitions, and general promotions
        run by Amazon. In addition, the first year was free as well because of
        the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/">free tier</a>. Over time, the
        bills went from nothing to ~7&euro;, which was not worth paying for
        just hosting a few pages and a small server. I had to look for alternatives.</p>
    <p>I evaluated <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud</a> as an
        alternative, and the main aspect I liked was the cheaper prices and the
        fact that I could open a SSH connection to the VM directly from the
        browser. This meant, I could work from anywhere in the world as long
        as I had access to a browser. The AWS also features a SSH-based browser
        client, but it works only when Java is installed in the browser. However,
        recently, Google has increased their price, so that it is no longer
        as cheap to run a simple instace when compared to AWS. They do offer
        a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/">free tier</a>, which includes
        a VM instance - but it has to be located in selected locations in USA.
        This was a deal-breaker as I want my server to be based in the EU -
        after all, my research is entirely based on European privacy laws.</p>
    <p>So while debating whether I should <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>
        or <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to provide a simple
        static hosting, I came across <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/">AWS Lightsail</a>,
        which is a simple hosting service (backend still based on EC2) but aimed
        at less tech-savvy users. The interface is simplified, and there isn't
        much to manage and do. More importantly, it is much cheaper - the starting
        price is only ~4&euro; and they include a SSH-client in the browser.
        So I started an instance to test it out.</p>
    <p>It took me only about ~2 hours to get my server up and running on the
        new VM. Key management was easy as I was provided with a SSH-key
        immediately on creating the server. Assigning a static IP was also
        easy - and it took only about ~10mins before I had changed the DNS to
        point to the new site and I could ssh in.</p>
    <p>So far, everything has worked smoothly - the browser ssh client is
        great. In fact, this post has been written entirely using that. The
        only concern is whether the billing will be easy and transparent as
        the rest of the things in Lightsail. Similar offerings are provided
        by <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> and
