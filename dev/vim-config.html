<p><a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> is important to know because of the position
it enjoys of being pre-installed on (nearly all) servers. For quick text
editing, there's nothing better than it. Plus, it doesn't take up a lot
of memory or CPU time, works well and consistently out of the box, and is
very <em>very</em> powerful. </p>
<p>In this post, I'll detail my vim configuration that has been gathered up over
the years.</p>
<h2 id="colorscheme">Colorscheme</h2>
<p>Vim contains several pre-installed colorschemes. However, I like to use
<a href="https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized">Solarized</a> with
the background set to dark. This matches my terminal colors, and allows
me to work well into the dark night. Sometimes during the day, I use
the light variant as it has a better contrast against the hard sunlight.</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>set background=dark
colorscheme solarized</code></pre>


<h2 id="formatting">Formatting</h2>
<h3 id="whitespace">Whitespace</h3>
<p>Whitespace formatting is important because literring a file with a mix
of tabs and spaces is a cardinal sin. I like to use a consisting tab
of 4 spaces across all editors I use. Vim can automatically expand tabs
to spaces, which is great.</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>set tabstop=4
set softtabstop=4
set expandtab
set shiftwidth=4</code></pre>


<h3 id="rulers-and-margins">rulers and margins</h3>
<p>Vim can show a visual line at a certain column to indicate text spilling
over. It is also possible to automatically (hard or soft) wrap lines
at that particular column. Usually, this is at 80 or 120 characters wide.
I usually like to keep it to 80 columns.</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>set colorcolumn=80
set ruler</code></pre>


<h3 id="folding">folding</h3>
<p>Folding means hiding certain text - say a function or a class and then
displaying the minimum required information such as class name or 
function definition. In vim, it is possible to restrict folds at certain
levels or to set how the folds are calculated. Since I mostly work in
python, I've set up the folding based on indent. I've also remapped
folding to the space key to make it super-easy to open and close folds.</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>set foldmethod=indent
set foldlevel=99
&quot; enable folding with spacebar
noremap &lt;space&gt; za</code></pre>


<h3 id="filetype">Filetype</h3>
<p>Vim can configure its settings according to the file type. Since I mostly
work with Python, which has indent-based syntax, vim knows to work with
the languge blocks in terms of <em>indents</em>.</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>set autoindent
set fileformat=unix
syntax enable
let python_highlight_all=1
filetype indent on
set encoding=utf-8
set autochdir   &quot; Change working directory to open buffer
set nocompatible
filetype off</code></pre>


<h2 id="line-numbers">Line numbers</h2>
<p>I cannot emphasise the importance of line numbers enough. Often when I'm 
helping students in the lab debug their programs, the compiler is kind enough
to mention the line number the error occurs at, and the student does not
notice it because they do not have line numbers turned on.</p>
<p><strong>ALWAYS TURN LINE NUMBERS ON</strong></p>
<p>They not only help in debugging, but are also a great way to quickly point out
a specific line to someone.</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>set number</code></pre>


<h3 id="relative-line-numbers">Relative line numbers</h3>
<p>Recently, I found a nifty thing vim is (now) capable of doing - showing relative
line numbers. Plain old simple line numbers begin numbering the first line from 1
and then 2 and so on to the end of file. Relative line numbers are relative to the
line the cursor is at. So the current line is <code>line 0</code> and the one above it and
one below it are <code>line 1</code> and so on. What this does in vim, is it makes motion
super easy to go to. In large files, where lines are in hundreds, going above to
a particular function on screen means typing out the entire line number. With
relative line number, one only needs to type out the <em>relative</em> number with the
motion, such as <code>5j</code> to go 5 lines below the current one. Combined with the
normal line number option, it shows the actual line number on the current line,
and relative line numbers on all other lines.</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>set relativenumber</code></pre>


<h2 id="other-options">Other options</h2>
<h3 id="spellcheck">Spellcheck</h3>
<p>Vim can highlight spelling errors in various languages (depending on the language
installed and available to use).</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>set spell</code></pre>


<h3 id="search-and-highlight-matches">Search and highlight matches</h3>
<p>In vim, searches can be highlighted as they are typed. This makes it easy to
see what the matches are, and is a behviour consistent with other editors.</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>set showmatch
set incsearch
set hlsearch</code></pre>


<h2 id="plugins">Plugins</h2>
<h3 id="solarized">Solarized</h3>
<p>Solarized comes as a handy plugin, available at 
<a href="https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized">Github</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ale">Ale</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/w0rp/ale">Ale</a> is an asynchronous linting engine,
which helps catch linting errors by showing them visually in vim. It is quite
fast, lightweight, and works with most of the popular languages.</p>
<h3 id="airline">Airline</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline">Airline</a> is a statusbar plugin
that adds colors to the tagbar (at bottom). It enables a visual mode to distinguish
between normal, replace, visual, and insert mode. Additional themes are 
available at <a href="https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes">Airline Themes</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ctrlp">CtrlP</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">CtrlP</a> allows opening files quickly using
<code>Ctrl+P</code> through character matching in the filename. For e.g. to open a file
at path <code>doc/abc/xyz.txt</code>, I can type <code>daxyz</code> and the file will come up
in the listing. It is a fast and easy way to open files or buffers.</p>
<h3 id="fugitive">Fugitive</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">Fugitive</a> is a git wrapper that allows
executing git commands over the currently opened file. It is very extensive,
and allows a plethora of git commands. Plus, it is authored by Tim Pope.</p>
<h3 id="surround">Surround</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround">Surround</a> allows manipulation of
surrounding brackets, quotes, tags, pretty much everything. </p>
<h3 id="tagbar">Tagbar</h3>
<p><a href="https://majutsushi.github.io/tagbar/">Tagbar</a> displays a sidebar consisting 
of CTags found in the file. Requires exuberant ctags. Selecting a tag
allows quick movement to wherever it is defined in the file. For easier
manipulation, map the sidebar to show/hide using <code>F8</code>.</p>
<h3 id="commentary">Commentary</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary">Commentary</a> allows 
quick comment/uncomment using <code>gc</code>. Can be used with motion, making
it possible to quickly comment an entire paragraph or visual selection.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-cursors">Multiple cursors</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors">Multiple Cursors</a> allows
inserting multiple cursors just like Sublime Text, though it is not as
simple or as elegant to do it in Vim.</p>
<h3 id="easymotion">EasyMotion</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion">EasyMotion</a> allows quickly moving
ahead by word or through the next few lines using a single-letter motion.
It is surprisingly simple to use and makes short motion easy.</p>
<h3 id="signature">Signature</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kshenoy/vim-signature">Signature</a> allows interacting
with vim marks, which are like bookmarks in a file. It allows alphabetical
traversal, removing marks, and all sorts of things which make navigating
back and forth through files a little easier.</p>
