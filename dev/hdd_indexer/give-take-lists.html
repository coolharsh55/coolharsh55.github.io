        <p>So far, using hdd-indexer, you can indentify what movies are present on
the disk, get their metadata, browse using this metadata. So you know
what’s the highest rated movie you have, or what’s the latest movie you
have. Great. But what happens when you meet up with a friend, and
there’s exchanging of movies? You both ask each other what movies are
present that you don’t have, find the movie files amongst all the (if)
randomly named and arranged folders, and then copy them one by one. Too
much repetition. So I decided to see if I can get hdd-indexer can do
something about it.</p>
<p>I came up with the simple concept of give/take lists, which show a
two-column list of movies that</p>
<ul>
<li>you have to give to your friend, meaning he doesn’t have these
    movies on his disk, and</li>
<li>you have to take from your friend, meaning you don’t have these
    movies on your disk</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve studied (and remember!) a little bit of math (set theory, to
be precise) you can see that the the above two conditions are nothing
but an application of set difference. Let’s say that X is the set of
movies on your disk, and Y is the set of movies on your friends’ disk.
Then by set theory, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>X - Y: movies on your disk that are not on your friend’s disk</li>
<li>Y - X: movies on your friend’s disk that are not on your disk</li>
</ul>
<p>The assumption here, is that all objects in X and Y are similar, or can
be compared to see if they exist in either set. Which means, that the
format in which movies are stored, or indexed on both disks must be the
same (or it will involve more work to first convert them both in to a
common format). Once we get a set of movies, it’s trivial to calculate
the set difference in any programming language. If you’re not an aware
programmer, I hope the pesudocode is self-explanatory. <span
style="\&quot;font-family:" monospace;\"=""></span></p>
<p><span style="\&quot;font-family:" monospace;\"=""><span
style="\&quot;background-color:" rgb(238,="" 236,="" 225);\"="">function
set_difference(X, Y): </span></span></p>
<p><span style="\&quot;font-family:" monospace;\"=""><span
style="\&quot;background-color:" rgb(238,="" 236,="" 225);\"=""> var
difference = list() # empty list </span></span></p>
<p><span style="\&quot;font-family:" monospace;\"=""><span
style="\&quot;background-color:" rgb(238,="" 236,="" 225);\"=""> for x
in X: </span></span></p>
<p><span style="\&quot;font-family:" monospace;\"=""><span
style="\&quot;background-color:" rgb(238,="" 236,="" 225);\"=""> if x
not in Y: </span></span></p>
<p><span style="\&quot;font-family:" monospace;\"=""><span
style="\&quot;background-color:" rgb(238,="" 236,="" 225);\"="">
difference.add( x ) </span></span></p>
<p><span style="\&quot;font-family:" monospace;\"=""><span
style="\&quot;background-color:" rgb(238,="" 236,="" 225);\"=""> return
difference</span></span></p>
<p>Once we calculate this difference, we get a list of movies to give and
take. This eases a part of the transaction - finding which movies should
be exchanged. There’s still the other parts that need to be addressed:
copying movie files. To make this possible, we need to understand what
happens when movies are exchanged. The files containing these movies are
copied directly to the disk, if available, or else to a temporary
location (to be copied to the disk later). In both cases, it’s a
copy-file operation that can be automated using a script.\</p>
<p>Since hdd-indexer is aware of the file paths of movies indexed in its
database, the creation of such a script is trivial.```</p>
<p><span style="\&quot;font-family:" monospace;\"=""><span
style="\&quot;background-color:" rgb(238,="" 236,="" 225);\"="">function
copy_script(movie_list, target_folder): </span></span></p>
<p><span style="\&quot;font-family:" monospace;\"=""><span
style="\&quot;background-color:" rgb(238,="" 236,="" 225);\"=""> var
script = list() # empty list </span></span></p>
<p><span style="\&quot;font-family:" monospace;\"=""><span
style="\&quot;background-color:" rgb(238,="" 236,="" 225);\"=""> for
movie in movie_list: </span></span></p>
<p><span style="\&quot;font-family:" monospace;\"=""><span
style="\&quot;background-color:" rgb(238,="" 236,="" 225);\"=""> # cp
for *NIX, copy for WINDOWS </span></span></p>
<p><span style="\&quot;font-family:" monospace;\"=""><span
style="\&quot;background-color:" rgb(238,="" 236,="" 225);\"=""> #
shell command </span></span></p>
<p><span style="\&quot;font-family:" monospace;\"=""><span
style="\&quot;background-color:" rgb(238,="" 236,="" 225);\"="">
script.append(“copy movie_list to target_folder”)</span></span></p>
<p>Depending on the platform, the command to copy changes. Fortunately,
this trivial differences are taken care of because hdd-indexer uses
python, which offers libraries that do the work on all platforms. So we
merely have to tell the script that we want a file copied from one path
to another.</p>
<p>After copying, the part that does not figure in the movie exchange -
adding these files to hdd-indexer comes up. There’s always the easiest
way to simply copy the files in the movie folder on disk, and let
hdd-indexer detect them and download their metadata. But to make things
more challenging, and better, we can export the metadata along with the
copied files. Hdd-indexer can simply create a file called, say,
get_list.json that will contain a list of all movie files that have
been copied, and their metadata. Now you can simply import this file in
to hdd-indexer, and it knows what movie files to add along with their
metadata.</p>
<p>There, a simple example of exchanging movies between friends gets
another feature added to hdd-indexer!</p>
