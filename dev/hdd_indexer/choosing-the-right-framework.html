        <p>The main aim of the <strong>HDD-Indexer</strong> is to provide an easy to use, yet
powerful and complete abstraction to the data on the disk. The main
point to focus on here is that this is an external disk. It can and
probably will be used on different systems. Therefore, the first
requirement of whatever technology we use is that it should
be <strong>cross-platform</strong>.</p>
<p>The first thing that comes up when someone says <em>cross-platform</em> is
java, and for a good reason. Java has matured a great deal, and has
developed into a stable language that works great across any scale. But
it isn't the most easy to develop with. That honor goes to languages
like python and ruby, that have a huge community of frameworks and
libraries that are just ready to deploy. </p>
<p>Along with the language, another major aspect is the GUI. The terminal
is great, but to really have a visual usability of the data, we need a
GUI. While there are quite a lot of frameworks and libraries that aid in
making GUI apps, the best bet is to use something that every user has
installed on their system - their browser. The browser provides the
ideal environment, because it is readily available and is pretty much
consistent across platforms. The variations are in individual standards
and procedures adopted by the different browsers, which is quite
acceptable.</p>
<p>Deploying to a browser requires either statically compiled pages (html
files) or a local web server. Static compiled pages are great, except
that they cannot change, or interact with the data outside of the
programmed links. A local web server is much more powerful, because it
can accept requests, respond to them, and make changes (to the data on
disk) as required. Python readily comes up with a nifty web server
(SimpleHTTPServer) that works great for local deployment of files. But
there are other powerful options that save development efforts and make
deployment easier.</p>
<p>Web frameworks such as Django, Flask, and Pyramid allow creation of web
apps while saving a great deal of developer time. Django especially has
become a lot popular due to its large number of features, while Flash
offers a lightweight, barebones and quick method of deploying something.
I'm going to choose <strong>Django</strong> simply because I want to finish and
iterate as quickly as possible. Using a local web server also (kind of)
implies a local database. There's no better choice than <strong>SQLite</strong>
(although there are a lot many NoSQL options coming up) to store the
data on disk. At most, it should take up a few MBs worth of space. </p>
<p>Deploying brings up issues of dependencies. What if python is not
installed? Or the libraries are not installed? And so on. To address
such issues, it would be better to use a portable version of python on
disk, and then download the dependencies as statically stored
libraries.</p>
