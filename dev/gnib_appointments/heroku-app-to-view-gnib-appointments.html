        <blockquote>
<p><strong>recap:</strong> In the previous posts, I described retrieving GNIB appointments
through an endpoint using javascript in the browser console, a bash script,
and a python script.</p>
<p><strong>source</strong>: hosted on Github <a href="https://github.com/coolharsh55/GNIBappointments/">here</a></p>
<p><strong>webapp</strong>: hosted on Heroku <a href="https://gnibappt.herokuapp.com/">here</a>
shows available timings for GNIB and Visa appointments</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The good thing about a script is that they can be run pretty much anywhere,
such as a dedicated web-server, or the phone (through some tedious efforts),
a raspberry pi, or through free services like <a href="https://heroku.com">heroku</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, I describe setting up the appointment script on a heroku instance.
The appointments are refreshed every 30mins (a resonable time), and can be
viewed at any time using <a href="https://gnibappt.herokuapp.com/">this</a> website.</p>
<h2 id="heroku">Heroku</h2>
<p>Heroku is a PaaS service, which means that it takes care of everything
and lets you focus only on the web browser part of it. It provides 50 free instances
for apps, which can be accessed using the address <em>https://app-name.herokuapp.com</em>.
Oh, and free HTTPS! Heroku provides app support for a large variety of languages,
which (on the date of this post) include Node.js, Ruby, Python, Java, PHP, Go, Scala, and Clojure.
There is support for more languages, which can be checked through official documentation.</p>
<h3 id="deployment">Deployment</h3>
<p>Publishing apps on heroku requires an account, which is free to sign up. The free tier gives
access to 1000 free hours of compute time which can be used in as many instances as you want,
though I think the number is limited to 50. Each app/instance or as heroku terms it - dyno - is
automatically suspended after 30 mins of inactivity. That means that it starts (and is a little slow)
after 30 mins of no-one using the app. Each dyno has access to 512MB of RAM (generous!) and
can perform operations on a single CPU (thread/worker).</p>
<p>Deployment can be made by using the heroku toolbelt which are a set of utilities that help with
version control and pulling logs from the app instance. Or the app can be connected to a git
repository online such as Github so that commits are automatically deployed to the app.</p>
<h3 id="procfile">Procfile</h3>
<p>A <code>Procfile</code> specifies the command and parameters for heroku to use when running the instance.
The procfile should be situated in the base directory of the app. For a simple, single dyno, free app,
the procfile specifies the command <code>web: command --arguments</code> as a way to specify that the dyno
is of type <code>web</code> (as opposed to <code>worker</code>) and starting it will run <code>command</code> with the specified
arguments.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">requirements</h2>
<p>Heroku supports third-party libraries which (in the case of <em>python</em>) can be specified using
<code>requirements.txt</code>. Any library in this file will be installed before starting the app.</p>
<h3 id="bottle">Bottle</h3>
<p><a href="https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/">Bottle</a> is a small, minimal python web framework that provides routing
and templates and is very easy to run. Bottle is a single file library/module. Since the requirements
of the GNIB project are simple, the project contains just one file - <code>app.py</code>. It uses much of the same
code as specified in the last post to perform the actual requests. </p>
<h3 id="gunicorn">Gunicorn</h3>
<p><a href="http://gunicorn.org/">Gunicorn</a> is a python WSGI HTTP server, which in plain-speak means that it
handles requests and lets bottle do the routing and actual work of generating page responses.
The following snippet runs gunicorn with bottle.</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-python"> run(
    debug=True,
    server='gunicorn', host='0.0.0.0', port=int(env.get(&quot;PORT&quot;, 5000)))</code></pre>


<h2 id="checking-appointments-every-30-minutes">Checking appointments every 30 minutes</h2>
<p>Since our free app contains only a <code>web</code> worker without any background processes, we use a simple
<code>if-then-else</code> conditional to check if it has been more than <em>30 mins</em> since we last checked appointments.</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-python">from datetime import datetime
last_checked = None

def check():
    if last_checked is None:
        get_appointments()
        last_checked = now
    else:
        now = datetime.now()
        diff = now - last_checked
        if diff.days &gt; 0 or diff.seconds &gt; 1800:
            get_appointments()
            last_checked = now</code></pre>
