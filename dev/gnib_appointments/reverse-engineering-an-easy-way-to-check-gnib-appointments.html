</blockquote>
<p>As per the the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/registration">Irish Law</a>
I must register myself with the local Police (or Garda). They issue a GNIB
card, which is proof that I am registered with them and am permitted to
remain in Ireland. For this, I need to take an appointment online through
their <a href="https://burghquayregistrationoffice.inis.gov.ie/">website</a>. Seems like
a little extra effort but then that much was enough to make me stop working
on what I was supposed to be doing and instead look into how I can <em>save time</em>
on these appointment bookings.</p>
<p>The caveat with this approach is that now everyone books online, and somehow
there almost <em>never</em> are any free appointments available. To just check whether
there are any appointments available (in a future date), I need to full a form
with 15 fields, which itself takes 5 minutes, 
only to see a <em>"no appointments available"</em> message at the end. Frustrating.</p>
<p>Through this post, I aim to document my efforts into reverse engineering
GNIB appointment website and protocols to easily get available appointments.
It resulted in a bit of javascript code that when pasted into the browser
console, prints the available appointments.
This is intended to be a first of many posts detailing my efforts to make 
this a side-project and a tool that can be helpful for others.</p>
<h2 id="digging-through-javascript-form-onclick">Digging through javascript - Form <code>onClick</code></h2>
<p>The first rule of automation is to familiar oneself with what is being automated.
So I set out to inspect what happens when I fill the form and hit the get 
appointments button. This involved digging through the javascript the site
runs and following variables and AJAX requests around. Thankfully, Chrome makes
this really easy using <code>right click -&gt; inspect</code>.</p>
<p>The button (id <code>btLook4App</code>) has an <code>onclick</code> value of <code>allowLook4App()</code>
defined in 
<a href="https://burghquayregistrationoffice.inis.gov.ie/Website/AMSREG/AMSRegWeb.nsf/AppForm.js">Appform.js</a>.
The function calls another function called <code>get4DateAvailability()</code> which
is where the appointments are retrieved using an AJAX request.
The url for this request is constructed dynamically using the statement
<code>"/" + stPath + "/(getApps4DTAvailability)?openpage"</code> where 
<code>stPath</code> is <code>"Website/AMSREG/AMSRegWeb.nsf"</code>. One thing to note here is 
the addition of <code>openpage</code> at the end of the URL - it is meant to be an
empty GET parameter. Looking at the other parameters of the AJAX request,
one can figure out that it only sends information about </p>
<ol>
<li>Category</li>
</ol>
<p>Yup, that's all the information it sends from those 15 fields that were filled.
The whole requirement of needing the entire form to be filled and validated
before sending requests is a <em>sham</em> (and a shame). </p>
<h2 id="get-request">GET request</h2>
<p>The GET parameters can be summarised as:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;cat&quot;: &quot;value of element #Category&quot;,
    &quot;sbcat&quot;: &quot;All&quot;,
    &quot;typ: &quot;Renewal&quot;,
    &quot;openpage&quot;: &quot;&quot;
}</code></pre>


<p>The kicker here is that the URL handling this GET request has (sanely) been
configured to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">CORS</a>
which means that I cannot just query it from any other website.
So I opened the browser console and tried to see if my AJAX request worked
by basically copying a minimal version of the original. It needs a variable
called <code>dataThis</code> which is based on Category and a static string.</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-js">var dataThis = &quot;&amp;cat=Study&amp;sbcat=All&amp;typ=Renewal&quot;;
$.ajax( {
    type : &quot;GET&quot;,
    url :   &quot;/&quot; + stPath + &quot;/(getApps4DTAvailability)?openpage&quot;,
    data : dataThis,
    success : function(data) {
        console.log(data);
    }
});</code></pre>


<p>which yields the JSON response of <code>Object {slots: "[]"}</code> which is NOTHING. </p>
<h2 id="ajax-request-and-response">AJAX request and response</h2>
<p>So I knew I was on a wrong track. Further diggging through requests gave the new
URL of <code>"/" + stPath + "/(getAppsNear)?openpage"</code> in function <code>getEarliestApps()</code>
which is part of a hidden button that gets activated/shown only after the 
form is complete and validated. Querying this new URL using the following function yielded in the given response.</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-js">var dataThis = &quot;&amp;cat=Study&amp;sbcat=All&amp;typ=Renewal&quot;;
$.ajax( {
    type : &quot;GET&quot;,
    url :   &quot;/&quot; + stPath + &quot;/(getAppsNear)?openpage&quot;,
    data : dataThis,
    success : function(data) {
        console.log(data);
    }
});</code></pre>


<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;slots&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;id&quot;: &quot;0A03221D91CF90848025811400317D02&quot;,
            &quot;time&quot;: &quot;4 July 2017 - 10:00&quot;
        },
        {
            &quot;id&quot;: &quot;3B7F286B73A976F08025812500318633&quot;,
            &quot;time&quot;: &quot;21 July 2017 - 08:00&quot;
        }
    ]
}</code></pre>


<p>On a successful query, the response sends over available times in a list 
under the key <code>slots</code> comprised of <code>id</code> and <code>time</code>, both of which are
strings. For my purpose, it was enough to extract the <code>time</code> values as
available appointments. Studying <code>getEarliestApps()</code> shows the conditions
and ways to detect other possible conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is a field called <code>data.error</code> then the request has an error</li>
<li>If there is a field called <code>data.empty</code> then there are no appointments currently available</li>
<li>Just to be sure, I also check length of <code>data.slots</code> as it can be an empty list</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-quick-way-to-get-appointments">A quick way to get appointments</h2>
<p>This gave me a way to quickly check available appointments by opening the website and executing the AJAX request with the <code>success</code> function printing out the
available appointment times. Any error on the console means there was an
error with the request or there are no appointments available currently.</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-js">var dataThis = &quot;&amp;cat=Study&amp;sbcat=All&amp;typ=Renewal&quot;;
$.ajax( {
    type : &quot;GET&quot;,
    url :   &quot;/&quot; + stPath + &quot;/(getAppsNear)?openpage&quot;,
    data : dataThis,
    success : function(data) {
        for(appointment of data.slots) {
            console.log(appointment.time);
        }
    }
});</code></pre>


<h2 id="future-plans">Future plans</h2>
<ul>
<li>Turn this into a <strong>script</strong> that I can run anywhere (terminal/server) so that it
can be automated (<code>cron</code>)</li>
<li>Create a <strong>chrome extension</strong> that does the AJAX request automatically periodically
and then notifies using an icon the available appointments</li>
