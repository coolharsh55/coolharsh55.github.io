            <p><strong>Content curation</strong> can be carried out either manually or
automatically. In the first case, it’s done by specially designated
curators. In the second case, it’s done using one or more of the
following: <strong>Collaborative filtering, Semantic analysis, and Social
rating.</strong>[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_curation)</p>
<p>What does a user want to do when he opens a news aggregator app? He
wants to read the news. That’s exactly the approach that has been taken
by every news aggregator app until now. The user wants to read the news
from various sources, and he may be searching for a particular news
source, so the app will contain filters, folders, tags etc. to let
the <em>user</em> do the hard work. Apps like Flipboard rely on <em>users</em> to
curate the articles into Magazines, which mostly will not satisfy other
users looking for their own version of news reading. In such a case, a
machine algorithm that curates the news based on the topic at hand is
ideal for the user, as it allows the freedom to then specify which of
the current popular topics the user is interested in.</p>
<p>Let’s take the example of Amazon’s Fire Phone launch a few days back
(Jun 18th). Virtually every news source was filling in post after post
about the many wonders brought on by Jeff Bezos. Translate this to what
the user saw : A list full of Fire phone articles repeated again and
again. Compare with what the user <em>wanted</em> : To simply know about the
Fire phone. There are two things to <em>learn </em>and <em>understand </em>here –</p>
<ul>
<li>The user wanted to know more about the Fire phone without reading
    about it again and again</li>
<li>The repeated Fire phone articles overshadowed other news articles</li>
</ul>
<p>Which brings us to our solution – which for now, simply addresses the
two things we’ve just learnt – <em>repetition </em>and <em>preference</em>. Repeated
articles can simply be clubbed together under a label called <em>Amazon
launches Fire Phone </em>and since there were more articles about it than
any other topic, it floats right to the top. Other similar articles are
clubbed together and shown based on how frequent the different sources
wrote about it.</p>
<p>To tell the user how many articles are currently available about the
Amazon Fire Phone, a small number could be shown in the corner of the
label. Selecting the label would open the feeds page for the articles
related to the topic. The user can then browse the topics by time, or
source. Once the user has finished reading, marking the entire label as
read allows the user to clean up the feed and to focus on other topics.
This allows the reading of more news, and makes a better use of time.</p>
<p>Other existing (if any) features can still be built on top of this
structure as the feeds are merely categorized under a label, but are
still available. The UI would not be drastically any different from
other apps that have folders, filters, streams etc. already in use. This
means that existing apps can easily adapt this approach as an added
functionality without much UI change.</p>
